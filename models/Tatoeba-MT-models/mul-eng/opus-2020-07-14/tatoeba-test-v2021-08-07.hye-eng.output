Why didn't you write me?
Why did you stop me?
Women change the world.
What a shame!
What will one finally help or not?
The tree's broken.
The wood is floating.
Danaley, work.
Why?
Wow.
Write me.
Years have passed.
Yes:
You can't do this without me.
You can't do this without me.
You're doing good to re-evaluate:
Let's do it again.
It's good to go home as soon as possible.
You don't do anything but eat.
You have to sign this.
You have to sign this.
You have the right to have your opinion.
You don't get it well.
You're so short.
You're so short.
You're a lot of words.
You're the leader.
You're running.
You're running.
You know I'm in love with Mary.
You tried:
You tried.
You were supposed to wait.
You were supposed to wait.
