We need to ask for permission from Tom.
He's starting to be interested in Arabic.
I said, "What do you mean?" But it turns out, because if I had a voice, it would have been very simple.
I tried to make Charles help me, but he didn't.
It was fun alone.
Take advantage of every opportunity.
A Sammy's double life to a great extent.

The burden needs to be lifted.
See how you work.
Anyway, that's not important.
Can I ask where you're going?
It's Tom's birthday, it's called Mary.
I hope the snow never ends.
I want Sam to give him more money.

Sami continued sending messages to Ellie.
Aren't you busy tomorrow?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
No one understands what's going on.

That's what I'm dreaming about.

This idea is not rational.
What's the real reason you didn't want to do this?
They're going to have dinner at Raquel's.

I got a piece out of the office.
I understand your tongue.
You may be forced to leave.
For five weeks.
We can't wait for the night.

Not all questions deserve an answer.
It was Sami's advice.
Who's the bomber?
I'm sure he did.
Are you talking to me?
We're facing a serious crisis.

Is there anything wrong?
I forgot my e-mail address.
Read the book from the front to the back.
Get out of the hospital.
Our child can be taken care of.
Do you like the ice cream?
It's a trap.
Is he a friend?
He's making the brain before he leaves.
I'm going to go to jail until I get in line.
He's late.
