Tom always tells Mom he loves her.
Why do you always cry?
That's exactly what I wanted.
We all dreamed of you.
The mirror is broken.
I've never fished with Tom.
Tomo thinks it's a mistake.
My daughter likes summer fruits, for example, cheeses, watermelons and Persians.
I won't forget that.
Oh, when will they meet again?

Tom and Mom would've done this if they only knew how.
She came from the store, finding that the stars took her bike.
The next day he was found dead in the bedroom.
We've always paid in Germany with travel tickets.
I know what you did in Boston.
If you can't enjoy your solo, you can't enjoy the association with someone else.
We have to wait for Tom.
They died after each other.
No one can stop you.
