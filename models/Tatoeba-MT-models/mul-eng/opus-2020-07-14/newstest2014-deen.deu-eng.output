Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 feet of foot-and-mouths were taken into operation at the village park - in view of the older Rathausampel.
Two facilities, according to each other: will they have a visa or a visa?
This question was answered yesterday by Gutachs Mayor.
"The Rathauampel was then installed because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser appel secures both bicycles as well as bus guests and the mountain dwellers.
The facility officially operated yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, Cor park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the transport flow from the residential area ‹Grub’.
"When the high traffic and foot-and-mouthing arrived, their safety would have to be a further challenge here," said Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landrassamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33 every day about 12,000 vehicles are the community of Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy load traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another app is more than necessary: "Safety is just going ahead here", so Arnold.
In all four transport visits have been carried out, and a circuit was thought to have been re-arranged, but due to the gangs in the direction of Sulzbachweg/Krichstraße.
According to Arnold, at the location of the Ampelmasters, we were tested first: "With an extra to us with a special length of wood-loaded transporters, we have tested whether these vehicles can be driven from the Sulzbachway to the B 33 without touching the Ampelmast".
The approximately 15 000 euros of gold ampel plant itself is the "modernest thing on the market" described by Arnold.
The installation is equipped with colourful LEDs that shed so much light that the lights from the motorists, for example, are also well-known in deep-seas suns.
And it's also smart: the older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new one just eight watts.
There are three light plants per transport direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new facility: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Pressing the button, the top radar sensor will test the traffic.
If the road is free, immediately green will come for the pedestrian, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor will check whether the green phase for the footsteps can be completed.
"If a group of people or arrested on the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be sure about the train," Arnold explained.
Of course, the car driver should think here as a partner and watch the train.
This was not the case yesterday: the bell for footballers was green, and a top-class vehicle was broken - at the bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic villagelessness - the languagelessness, the hang of pure violence and stupid sexuality, the agony and unhappiness - have been described many times by the Kärntner Dichter.
The booker priest is known primarily as the prosa author, Theater texts are rare in his work.
College de prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher sets for his performance "Special lights on the toothbrush", which is now seen in the garage X at Petersplatz, so a collague from prosatexts together.
The theatermaker connects some elements from the autobiographical novel "The Leibegene" (1987) with prosaminations from "Leichnam, his family" (2003).
On the wide learning stage - an important requirement: a circular sofa that is co-operated and masturbated - the eight-piece assembly depends on the text material.
In this case, the director of Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance transmits the presentation with a full set of registries, known as the repertoire of postdramatic games.
In particular, the players will be involved in some controversial Chinese translations.
They will be firmly fixed, covered with the head under water, with their beaks attached to the wall.
Indignant in Zellophan or Mieder, they stick to dangerously high pieces by insinating, either monologize loud or lie completely buried on the floor floor.
However, the text does not appear to be in this complicated way.
The best moments have the night when it is healed - the band width ranges from Deep Purple to folk music.
Only against the end comes the overrun performance comes to something calm, and Winkler's immediately turns out to be absurd humor.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box, which is located in the armature bar of each car.
The devices that record each dangerous mile and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to review the old system to finance US roads.
The usually longer-term area of the road plan has suddenly created an intense debate with beautiful alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups and talk about using the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometres – and possibly where they have been taken – and can then use the information to calculate taxes.
The Tea Party is now.
The American Civil Law Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and raises a number of data protection concerns.
However, while some cannot attend the convention, several federal states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system in the next ten years to pay for the driver for dangerous miles.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we can only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who is planning a list of the dangerous miles of all California car drivers in the state since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from taxes that the US-Americans enter into the Gulf of Zapfsule, is paid.
But in America, it's no longer thought as much as it used to.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not drive at high prices to raise taxes even for a cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not possible for the future," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport law at the University of Minnesota.
Its Federal State has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to be tested by a mel-based payment system.
"This represents the most meaningful alternative of all," he said.
The bureaucrats refer to it as mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberal complaints because taxes, for example, have been used to influence driving behaviour so as to reduce noise and climate-related waste.
The California planners are focusing on the system for the development of strategies with which the legally agreed objectives of the federal state are to be achieved to climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transport Committee, has also stated that he sees the most long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation have also been prompted by the idea to allow drivers to pay for their returns.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement will also be supported by two former US Ministers of Transport, who had called on the Congress in 2011 to move towards a mid-term settlement.
The U.S. Senate approved a 90 million-dollar pilot project that had included 10,000 cars last year.
However, the majority of the representatives of the House prevented the president and responded to the concerns of members of rural areas who were people who often had to leave many miles on the road to work or to the city.
Several federal states and major cities are not moving at their own pace in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, which is currently running 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
This driver will soon pay the medicated fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state of the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it in a limited way with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, which consists of 17 Federal Ministers of Transport in the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where nearly 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment, car drivers were skeptical when thinking that the government could follow every move.
"Remembering Big Brother and such things was a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, leader of the strategy and performance management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on her website: “It would be relatively easy to convert the driver into advanced surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a giant, expeditious technological infrastructure that would be used without delay to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is part of a number of federal states that are now following an early technology review with which the State can capture the dangerous mileages, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan, the public would be even more baffled.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally involved in helping the federal authorities in the control of motor vehicles.
More than that, it was her goal to put in an emerging market for Kfz insurance feet where the driver should pay on the basis of the risks.
However, the devices tested by it are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded,” explained Ryan Morrison, director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilots, there was a major error.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planner experimentes to give car drivers a range of options.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device and instead pay a discount fee on the basis of the average mileage of all citizens of the state.
Others hope that they will be able to sell the concept of a mysterious public by equiping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic authorities want to develop a device for control that allows them to pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for dangerous mileages and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real time, thanks to the driver's interest rate.
"A car drivers would be motivated by the majority of the benefits offered by the system," it is said in a city planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole issue of the payments per mile is not just a huge deficit.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, the Congress could solve the problem of the Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing fuel taxes.
An additional single fee or an annual fee may be paid by car drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Legal and Public Affairs Officer.
When we do, hundreds of millions of car drivers take care of their privacy and many other things.
King's Field: Little Man's Wandering
The volunteer firefighter handled her head test despite personal deficiencies with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
The department's commander, Hans Kammerer, had examined the presence of Feder in the Burgberger Street in his exercise.
There should be a short-term conclusion at the end of the journey.
Two people were injured by the existing fire and smoking development, but one of them was able to send another emergency.
After the first inspection of the case by Hans Kammerer, two air defence officers were ready to take part in the building.
After a short time it was time to find the first person and lead to freedom.
The second person had to be taken.
This wasn't as easy as it was to overcome a little bit too.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stand for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There were lots of wood and also noiseballs in there.
In addition, there were electric machines for wood processing.
The first shot took place on the tank in the vehicle.
A further direction was made over an overfluorinated hydrant in about 100 metres away.
Three solutions could now be created.
There was also a wooden beam in the building.
His Kammerer was also involved in the exercise of what was to be done with little available staff.
In the event of a serious accident, support is provided for the King's day-to-day group.
The commander showed satisfaction with the completion of the training.
Networking of universities and companies is important
On his visit to Breisgau-Huchwarzwald, President of the Landdays, Guido Wolf also announced in Titisee-Newstadt, where the labour force came from tomorrow.
In the promotion centre, Hochschwarzwald, he went along with the business leaders of the vocational schools, the kreisgymnasium and the parentheses of this important issue.
"Image is an important location factor," Claudia Steele, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school education centre Highwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration between the promotion centre, Kreisgymnasium and the vocational centre.
He also praised the family friendship in the countryside.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also because of the demographic change, the phase of the care of members," said Wolf.
He also pointed out that he was increasingly concerned about the care and care of his employees.
"Without the support of the employer, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified labour force, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"Because he has already learned about the interests of the region during his studies, his acquired knowledge and his ability to obtain the regional economy often contribute to the strengthening of the region," the president of the country said.
Because only if adequate training facilities are offered, the need for professional workers can be covered.
In his view, the local advantage of the landscape is its advantage in the southwestern part of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his journey from Titisee-Newstadt to Freiburg, he experienced the ongoing efforts to develop public transport.
"Continue to stick closely and make sure that public transport will improve," he explained to the address of the present community politicians.
Music experiences a sustainable afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting Seniors to coffee, cooking and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were assessed in the Rastaste.
In the meantime, this afternoon is located in St. Joseph's Pflegeheim.
The inhabitants enjoy the delicious kitchens and gardens.
Later, it was Wurstsalat.
Silvia Kimmich-bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, were surrounded by traditional melody.
Over 100 years of age, natural stone mackerel, as a prior limitation of the old schoolhouse in the church street, is to be reimbursed at the costs of the city of Brüunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall, stabilized and static discharge of the natural wall with Balustrade was built during the first work of the previous school.
The next step is to include Alexander Misok from the Brüunling City Building, to include the landscape in the plans and to create a sanatorium concept for the old walls.
A cost calculation should then be carried out by experts, which should then be placed on the table by the Council for the decision and determination of the further proceeding.
A decision on this will be expected to take place in the coming year.
After the cleaning, planting and planting of the old school hall within the two side flights of 1912, the school has to be set up as a follow-up measure, which is based on sound and new infrastructure.
The historical, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old school on the church street is mainly due to water and cold damage, since there is no drawage, it needs healing and has a backbone.
Deep roses in individual rocks testify to the damage to weather, but the wall is not currently in danger.
A secure wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use a school hall, which is carried out by the current construction work.
It was originally planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure resulted in a breakdown.
An important word in the historical school ageing, which has already been used for film reception, will be discussed by the country's parliament.
If standards come from this side, then the city hopes that the memorial guards will receive benefits.
The students of the Brüunling Primary School, who are taught in a well-trained old school building with new Aula, can immediately use the old school.
Özdemir wants to get Jazza training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has also been active.
"I think it's a mistake to give the entire training at the Stuttgart Music School," Özdemir said the "Stutgard News".
Jazz and Classic are just at the Jazz Place Stuttgart together.
Üzdemir, who is in charge of a direct warrant at the Federal Day election in Stuttgart on 22 September, the Green-Route Government of the country.
This, based on an expert study, strengthens the reorganization of five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the study of Jazz and Pop should be destroyed by the Stuttgart Music School at the Mannheim Music School.
U.S. border: "Super tunnel" detected for drug use
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a "super-tunnel" on the drug field.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, more than 500 metres of roads between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity, rails and a heating plant.
Three suspects were subsequently arrested, eight tons of marijuana, and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could cross the radar," said the U.S. Secretary-General of the Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
The drug gangs are engaged in: "If you continue to build and use such tunnels, we are determined to make your dirty money for a huge waste."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Builded by Experts
Because of the existing equipment of the tunnel, the investigators are aware that he was built by architects and engineers and that the building took place about a year ago.
The body was so equipped that electricly operated vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building which is 80 metres away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader will lead 20 metres into the depths to the actual tunneling.
The tunnel has a diameter of 1,20 meters and 90 cm wide.
It would also be appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two suspects were found to be associated with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested because of the accused Marihuanas.
All three claim to be the highest penalty of life-long freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it has continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that was found in such a tunnel building cocaine.
Normally cocaine is mixed in smaller quantities and not mixed with tunnels.
This shows the "disquieting" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have been cut apart, said Bill Sherman from the DEA drug arrest in San Diego.
They'd do everything they could to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one of the six Mexicans, had it.
They have to count for up to ten years.
2014 will be the Year of the Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen at 1250.
The repetition of the first official reference always draws closer.
If the year is going to end in good eight weeks, the anniversary is on.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned for the first time in an orderly manner.
In the church, an auction was made, which is mentioned both places.
On March 15th, it is supposed to give an official reception for the anniversary year, and since there are no halls now, this event will take place in the place where both of the church houses were first mentioned 1250 years ago.
In the context of the Jubilee, various events are planned both in gesingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Redo.
On Friday with a party, Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
This weekend is also the Church House of Churches.
The city music director, Rudolf Barth, wrote for the city on behalf of the Jubilàum, a three-term contract composition.
On 21 June, along with the Sunday festival of the Black Zaldswald, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new Festival.
This will be completed and extended in the jubilee year, the official term is on the last September, on 27 and 28 September.
A new Chronicle will also be released on the occasion of the city’s dissipation.
"But it should be a chronic not only by ghosts themselves, but by a printed work on the spirits of today, which is also made up of Geisingen, Church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmaningen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the spirits of today celebrate 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was filled with the announcements.
The new Chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival in Gesingen.
2014 is also another year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Stroglonki starts on February 8th with a handout on its 60-year-old possession, the harmony of Gutmangingen will be 90 years old, and on March 29th, it has the banquet and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old works Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Gesinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and will celebrate this on May 10, the music fair Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and will celebrate it in the framework of the Brown Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a skirmish, owned by the St. Gallen monastery in 764.
The case was held in church (houses), which was then a court case.
Both communities are then mentioned in the same sentence.
Based on 2014 this 1250 year to celebrate, it is also the 40-year Community form.
The Council takes the lead in the viewer
Whether "Am Hirsch" should be automatically built to increase traffic safety
Yes, the Community has decided.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary to take €220,000 into account.
The German Railway wants to improve the Kinzigtal Railways in the coming year.
In particular, the safety of train crews should be increased - regularly it is bound to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
In order for the communities to take the necessary measures, they must participate with a third party at the cost of sharing the rest of the train and bond.
Schiltachs Mayor Roland Grißehaber explained to the council the specialities of the "Am Hirschen".
There the city is planning to build an outlet at the height of the nearby tunnel in the west of the railway station.
There could also be larger vehicles, for example, such as those transporting longholz, in opposition without having to block the holes.
The complainant therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be constructed so that the city could extend the time given to the next road in order to ensure a free flow of traffic.
This was discussed in the House of Commons, since some of the councils questioned the necessity of street distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his remarks, brought to the attention of the critics on the point: "Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas protested: The "Hirschen" pass will be used regularly for longholz transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be transported partly over this road, because the vehicles could not use the passage at the Haberles bridge for up to 20 meters.
In addition, the routes served as directions for those vehicles that should not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, the haas argued.
Given that Churchberg and Schlossberg tunnels have to be built and repaired, as is now in Wolfach's case, the "Hirschen" railway crossing could also have an important meaning for a longer period of transport.
The wheels agreed to let us examine which costs would cause the expected spread of the road.
In spite of this, the construction of the railway has been largely in line with the measure that the necessary support wall is built so that the city can be built on the next road, where appropriate, for traffic around 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the construction of the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwin could lead to a completely different problem that concerns the journey into the strong "Gereltzaus road".
The administration had been able to investigate the construction plans of the railway by the Engineering Office Breinlinger, since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection to the Geroltzau Way was still possible.
The investigation led to the conclusion that it would not be excluded that the renewal of the road could lead to longer vehicles.
The responsibility for this again took the city as a street construction worker.
The construction could then lead to debt disputes.
Since the wood transport and the area of the current state of development were functioning, one should not agree to the construction of the passage of the train, which was argued by Haas.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is significantly lower than that of the other railway crossings, because there is a direct link between the centre of the train.
Even trainers from the main train station had to be in this position for so long that no collision would collapse.
Mostly, the construction of this railway was refused, since Schiltach had to "remove" the problem with existing vehicles, so that the train could withdraw after the completion of the construction work.
As a matter of fact, the company considers the constructions of the railways "For Heubach" and "For Kuhbach" for the already cross-border agreements with the train.
Esa decides on major global missions: missions for billions
In addition to planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts of the European Space Agency now need to focus on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals stand for selection, five are still running.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets have already been found by other stars.
If there are at least some of these lives, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for growers?
Or would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are you looking for a mindless planet and perhaps discovering an extraterrestrial life?
These questions are directly addressed by the European Space Agency Esa.
For her "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that should make research crucial.
The Etat for such "L-missions" is approximately a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, in Paris, the elite of the European World Space Research team met to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas stood for debate, five of them have now come into the choice.
A number of groups began the proposals, followed by researchers.
The next day, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, four major issues have been selected by the Esa to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact steps in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the verbal dark.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life exist there?
To address this question, 2017 will start the World Space Telescope "Cheeps", with the 500 known planet systems in our nearby environment.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could imagine the mindful planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarks": gases that are used as an indicator for biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
The question should also be concluded on what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field with the planet's system.
In our solar system, these processes can be carefully examined.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (where the budget is at about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The sun is to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
The researchers are also very interested in Jupiter and its coins.
They want to find out what role the rain planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa is the first of three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The song "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she will reach Jupiter and will explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the expensive coins of Europe, Kallistto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world has many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature would be united.
How did the universe come into existence and where does it exist?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Orknall.
In addition to the material we enjoy, from the stars, planets, and living beings as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity combines galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the world.
Until then, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Urknall, there were dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M mission, which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the universe and thus enable the ability of the darker matter and the darker energy.
Who could make the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chance of a permit as a L-mission has, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding concept of proof of gravity.
These include physical changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They haven't been shown until today.
Elisa could create it, the scientists hope for the project.
The mission looks forward to a two or three-hour detector that will be stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on earth, it could also show gravity waves that have occurred at the end of the hurricane, providing new insights on the origin of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still to compete with the second L-mission: a large radio telescope called "Athena", which, among other things, should explore the black holes, "Icy Planets", a further mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "prism", a mission to prevent the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" of the sensitive planets.
They have already been set up, among other things, to try back transport from March, to explore the moon, Venus and asteroids, and to solar physics.
Snowden is ready to "copy" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, who is a former U.S. secretary of the U.S. secret service, has explained that he is ready to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Federal Day when the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander have no answers to their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Střöbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was received to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, who was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: “Even if the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a confidence and tries to criminalize political opinion with a violent attack, where no defence is possible."
But the truth is no crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to let the charges against him go.
The charges brought by the US Ministry of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said regarding the time online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to do so."
The relations between the United States and Germany are charged by the allegations that the NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, explained that it would be possible to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if that is possible, "without threatening him and completely destroying relations with the United States".
Steuble, a Greens' deputy, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Strombel explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden attends in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he is “safe” there, so to speak.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw a persecution campaign that had expelled him from his home.
However, he has been affected by the global response to "my act of political opinion".
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have referred the findings to an uncontrollable system of monitoring as a service to the public.
In his letter, Snowden offered the German authorities cooperation, “when difficulties have been solved about the humanitarian situation”.
Frontier Airlines boasts fees for handpacks
Frontier Airlines is planning to demand up to $100 of passengers who want to understand their flight's luggage.
Frontier Airlines aims to calculate up to $100 for a piece of handpack and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was to read the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire dose.
The new fee applies to handbags in the package over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars would be calculated if the fee would be paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for passengers who paid only on the flight path.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars was intended to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate these sums," she explained.
Flight companies start 2008 in order to require the first and second set-up package fees.
Passengers who tried to cross these have thus stopped as far as possible in the package, which has led to the fact that the packages are often overloaded over the seat.
Costs are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said, at the new fee, it's not really going to earn money.
It goes to the most reliable customers of Frontier, who had made it clear that it would always be harder to find a place in the shop over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight path from Frontier can carry a spare spare item, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable package.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the airport.
The new hand-pack fee from Frontier comes into force only in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often spend money on packaging and other charges, but airlines want to get back to it.
They argue that the transport of the package costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many on the Wall Street considered the new package fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after the loss years.
Most, however, are still allowed to pay taxes for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested three years ago as the first fee for handpacks and later Allegiant Air, also a ticket pilot.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained by Airline brother Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the spirit's handbag fee would bring in 50 million dollars a year.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with the spirit and was curious what he would expect at the airport if passengers were to face the company's unusual hand-held fee.
"The Boarding Process was one of the most vulnerable in my career in the air," he said.
I expected to see technical and hand-held discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boating loved how skirmished."
Frontier also follows the spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep all the doses and be filled with coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
U.S. Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshments, but it returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company was followed.
Frontier step to raise fees for the package if passengers do not buy directly from the airlines, the latest initiative is to be addressed with the customers on their own website.
Flight companies pay online travel offices like Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars for sale.
This gives all companies an invitation to move passengers to direct purchases with them instead of via an online travel office.
Frontiers, however, have gone to the highest level in this area.
In September, the company began to offer only half of the many many flights to an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were again cut to 25 percent of the plane.
One flight with a third bidder over 1000 miles, therefore, only 250 miles are introduced by customers.
Passengers can also only be booked directly on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a trusted customer status at his seat in Denver, but the business breaks down and the company loses money.
The exemption went back by 9% and the flight capacity dropped almost 13% in the first quarter, as in the financial report, published on Wednesday by the parent group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
The Republic has tried to obtain the funds of Frontier in the Griff in the context of the sale of the company.
Word Pictures From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last woman's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "words from the Bible" and "predictions from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the president of the church council, went to the Bible lecture after breakfast.
"Words contain life-styles, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words with the corresponding Bible texts and explained the meaning.
She called words like, "Let the wood go forth, as the shoots fall from the eyes, cast a look at a man whose eyes are in the sleep of the Lord, wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions, the speakers also advised their listeners what language it was speaking about.
The words from the Middle Ages were adopted by the church leaders Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something contiguous.
She explained the significance and origin of the speech applications that she called "breaks in the past".
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were badly rewritten before they were transferred to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast rounds, the mayor's candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployment: Pilot project for young people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched on the Mecklenburg Sea plate.
Under the direction of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as minors in the industry are to be trained by experts for hotels and guest rooms over three winters.
"It's new that the six-month course ends with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the Agency for Labour Neubrandenburg.
The benefits would be numerous: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would not be able to control the burden of experts who were increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes industrial and commercial rooms in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel and Guests' (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains, a "internal error" and not hacker is responsible for the crash of the website
The shadowed National Security Agency explained on the late Friday, an error has eased its public website for hours and not hacker, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available this night for several hours because an internal error occurred during a planned update”, the spy agency explained in a message sent by email.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the accident has been caused by a distributed DDOS attack is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers found that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is not yet available for some users.
Before that, a spokesman of the NSA said against ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority had compromised “in no way”.
Secret information would not be in danger, so the speaker.
At least a group of hackists claimed to have released the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
When such attacks, the target site will be moved with page calls until the server is uploaded and the website is compiled.
The cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not have to interfere with the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose name was first heard by No Search Agency (No such authority), is located between the bright light of the public and is seen after the enthusiasts that have been known in recent months on its published monitoring programme in the In and outside world are exposed to harsh criticism – a result of the secret NSA data that have been stolen and published by former NSA employees Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service threatened initial speculations about what is happening today is the result of a targeted Cypriot operation.
Lightly tired is the number of people without jobs in October at 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota with 3.1 per cent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more," says Monika Felder-bauer, Managing Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have responded to settings for a long time.
One reason for this is called Fielder Farmer: "We have very little expertise in manual work, health care and age care".
Yearly conditions have also been re-entered since September for staff in the hotel and guest business.
In mid-December the winter season begins.
The full background report is available in the General Notice of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Winnings for pumpardiers after return on delivery and orders
The Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent return on Thursday after repeated orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway lot were under pressure.
Bombardier, sitting in Montreal, also did not publish any flight data for his new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the honest timetable in the next September.
Only three more starts were followed on the young pilot flight of the test vehicle a month ago, which would have appeared to be questionable if the test phase was run as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course of more than eight per cent on the Toronto bridge.
Cameron Doersken, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "experform" to "sector performance" on Thursday in order to ensure that the share in the next one to two quarters had a limited short-term potential.
"We are clearly disappointed with the development of maritime transport," said Doersken in a customer letter.
We are of the opinion that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSieries if the pilot test programme for the aircraft is advanced.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries flight lines can catapult the company into the lower market segment, currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flow after monthly delays for the first time in September.
However, the CSeries' binding orders are moderated by 177 since potential buyers wait for the results of the flight's most successful and wish to see whether the company's assumptions regarding the fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new diesel vehicle are relevant.
At present there are 403 orders and orders from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, President of the Board, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company's management also ensured on Thursday against analysts and media, the programme is in the deadline.
"The test vehicle is no longer expected to remain on the ground," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, while the plane was under construction and software updates.
Each manufacturer plants different.
We have decided to undertake a first flight and then attach a reprocessing period to what we have done as well.
This is happening during the entire flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft will be expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining ones will have it from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts are skeptical whether a CSeries aircraft can be operated twelve months after the first customer's youth flight.
Bombardier explained that it will verify the planning for the operation (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flightest – even if they are clearly in line with Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that the launch takes place on the first quarter of 2015,” said Doersken.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30, Bombardiers nettowinn fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the year before.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cent.
The turnover was slightly lower and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, so Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's world's largest aircraft manufacturer has announced that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fall from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the air and space travel party amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged against 31 December.
"In the field of air and space travel, the results were a total surprise in our objectives, but the low commitment and market ratios were at stake," said Beaudoin.
The consumption in air and space transport parties fell by 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, noted that the consumption in this sector increased by almost half a million dollars.
The order stock in the transport party amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September and was slightly increased against 31 December.
The profit margin in transport has been affected by some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new standards for the fourth quarter.
On Thursday's afternoon trade, the Bombardier Act was 8.5 per cent followed by 4,83 Canadian dollars, after also announced that the Google Finance Board would be transferred to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the third largest commercial airliner and bomber in the world, reported a ten-percent decline in the quadratic wind on Thursday.
USA: Shoes at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fires at the LAX Airport on Friday morning.
While the airport leader announced the short term Twitter service, the protection was in danger, the "Los Angeles Times" reported the man to be up.
A security officer has also been killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama will be informed about the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3 with eyes attached to seeing a shield with a threat in one of the refugee camps as reported by several media.
A traveler told the CNN sender, many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and beat children.
Among those waiting for panic broke out, many had hidden themselves from fear behind bars.
He's heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
A staff member of the security authority TSA has suffered a stroke on his feet.
The scene was "like in a movie."
Then he himself was brought into a security area, the man reported.
The measures should be close to a security control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On television it was to see how many hospitals and police cars were running before a terminal.
Hundreds of people were safely taken out of the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter by a special user command and a threat on the ground.
As the air traffic driver announced on Twitter, the event began at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow.
The route routes were closed, which, according to CNN, formed a long return stop.
As long as the air traffic has been temporarily imposed on landfills, it has been stopped.
However, several pilots were also observed at the start on CNN.
Terminal 3 is mainly spent by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States.
cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss before police investigation must enter prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information about world size Neil Scarborough further
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A known criminal lawyer who warned a drug baron before a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret search could be detected was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided world-wide Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on findings about its drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine attempt.
The lawyer who was appointed by the criminals as “first class” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three Kokain Beutel at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues were eating in the hall.
The findings showed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine were found in his hair, his letter bag and credit cards.
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to create information about the arrest of two men in the task of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police during a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cubria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were arrested later after the police secured some of the heroin and cocaine household surveys in the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Dita, 42, continued to provide information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be published.
Today, Ditta, who worked for the Chancellor Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and sentenced to trial at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two cases because of the arrest of justice.
In an earlier investigation, he added the cocaine content.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that this had been in regular telephone contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two intelligence officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas' house and there placed the drugs with a 60 percent purity in a black golf course under the lawn mollton.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, stopped the drugs, and nine communications were exchanged between the two.
Before the trial, it was announced that Dita was a "regular consumer" of cocaine, after testing drugs of Class A were discovered in his hair, letter bag and credit cards.
Dita was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the possible dealer, because this was his mandate, and claimed that her discussion was under the "intellectual secret".
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken a hair test.
He told the police officer that he would be called to the house by a office and by a person at the workplace because of legal matters.
It was announced before the court that he had called for important actors in the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, after significant arrests, and had informed what the investigators knew about them.
State lawyer Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you don't break the law."
Dita is accused of misuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has been very involved with certain mandates.
The question is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his messages were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law enforcement and mandate.
He made the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta therefore appealed his position.
He was close to certain mandates, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
“ If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but do it right now.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organized crime."
Its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made it possible for the leaders of organised crime to include valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Dita has left this trust and tried to show herself behind the fassad of her profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the prosecutions against Dita, which also led to a trial in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and justice, which undermines our resolve to bring criminal proceedings before the courts.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arms of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of fraud against heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty-three more persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total punishment of 153 years for drug abuse.
On his website Ditta published a series of questions and answers about what he said about his dream job being to represent an attorney in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at night was Mohammed Ali and the chancellor's motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the holidays from the time of his 160-year-old existence, the Leiderkranz Dunningen is surrounded by two Godsservices with the "German Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the "Rock my Life" musical, which the audience urged this year, the band will save two God’s service at the end of the jubilee year with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary event will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martinuskische Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, at 10.15 a.m. in the service of God in St. Johannes Baptist church in Lakedorf.
The so-called German Messe with the original title "Sacrifices to the Festival of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The Mass will be presented in the framework of God’s service, as was the meaning of the assignmenter Johann Philipp Neumann.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the band of the musicians Frohsinn Tennenbrunn and Noemi Lolodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis weighs on the horizon
For example, with the election to the 2015 Pharmacovigilance Conference, the health care unit Haslach (SE) will be changed fundamentally.
Then there is only one common poultrymeat for all six pigs.
At a joint meeting, on Saturday the grasses of Haslach, Hofstette, Mühllenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welchenstein were preparing for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are not to be changed any more and it is to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it was particularly clear that the creation of the new is slowing down, however, with a view to a vision.
From the proposals and expectations of the new ones in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the Committee of the Regions, the very constructive discussions of the six Greeks with the head of the soul care team are being held.
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained through a presentation the new guidelines for health units in the Erzdiösse Freiburg.
Next, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six single churches.
It will be given only a joint council of the pharmacovigilance and a board of directors represented by the pharmacovigilance office.
Of each horse, at least two selected members shall be represented, in which six horses shall be trained as such at the place.
Your mission will be to promote church life in the place of the future.
On the question of the financing of the single farm community, there was a significant need for dialogue.
The innovations suggest that collected ghosts are kept together in the pharaohs.
On the other hand, the commitments go to the general community.
In view of the large planned investments, the obligation to meet all the pharaohs, there was considerable concern.
"In the past it was also invested only in projects that could only be managed by individual pharmacovigilance," related Haslachs, president of the Prinzbach Pfarr community.
Practical experience with a joint Gremium for five horses depicted Barbara Ritter, the chairman of the Gremium in the Skutterwald-Neuried Sea Care Unit.
They had done the task in 2006 "Be one, stay five" and had to make sure that this is not as simple as it is.
The groups of the Haslacher Soul Care Unit then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the Joint Pharmacovigilance Council and the practical work of the Community team.
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six groups in the coming spring.
Finally, Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the health unit, which was approved by the clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, the electricity will be expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorfs have to set themselves at higher power costs.
As the business leader of the city's works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, comes to a four-pound Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 Euro Multicost per year.
The main reason for the current price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC budget from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This facility will be re-established each year by the four operators of the major power stations in October.
These relate to the multi-cost costs arising from energy sources which can be borne by an investment over the electricity price.
The cities of Pfullendorf are the last ice in this chain.
The Board of Supervisors of the Energy Company has even been informed by an increase in its forecasts, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now, the actual wages had to be calculated before the cities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going out of a slope of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number is going to be closer to 2 cents.
Apel on a long-term route: On a waiting time
Sometimes an apple doesn't just grow green.
The contact boards in the street do not react, or the light sign is defective.
What do you want to do with Rot?
Having waited a very long time for a red bell and the cross is free, he can continue, explained by the Student Lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adjusted" what could be explained differently from the case.
Becker is ready to leave at least five minutes before a malfunction of the needle is removed.
However, those who continue to drive in spite of red light must be aware that they bear the full responsibility for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who has been patient for less than five minutes will not wait long, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice Hamm.
In the case in question, a driver had ignored the bell after about three minutes and had to answer for a ignition of light.
The appel was not a defect, but was later transferred to Green.
A ban was imposed on him because of the special situation - but the penalty was not.
The Community is pleased with the solid budget
When it comes to the budget at Community meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The common fund in Herdwangen-Schönach has been well-filled and debts have not been known since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be covered as a full success in this regard.
This was highlighted in the 2012 annual report.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around €7.6 million would fall over a million euros higher than planned.
The Administrative Board's surplus is also around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
In particular, the over-the-counter tax and the share of the income tax in the general budget should be considered.
The amount of property was also re-examined by the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it accounted for EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially at higher administrative level," said Rothmund.
Since less investments have been carried out as planned in the financial year 2012, recovery has also been higher.
Overall, the overall recovery of around EUR 2.1 million could now be increased to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"It's not like a work that's just being shot out of the brain," said Gerster with a look at the year's accounting.
He and the community are very happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but these good numbers could soon be more expensive for the citizens.
Through the good financial situation, the community in the past was able to ignore high levels of taxes.
However, according to Gerster, more than a year ago, more than a year had been cut off from the country.
There are conditions for these additions from different equations.
In particular, the cities and communities applying for tenders must provide certain headings.
"We must look at the topic of Hebesetze, because in the coming years we have made investments that we would like to make," Gerster announced in this connection.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in Chor for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history in men's singing song in Cécilia is almost doubled as long as the festival, in which he was well respected.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his men's uniforms on the stage.
Even after 60 years, he seems to have had a lot of fun with the love-winning choir.
At the same time, summers were also active, including 28 years of membership of the Committee.
For his commitment and commitment, he received the same number of nominations: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Reference in the Order of the Cécilien binding Rottenburg-Stutgart, handed him over to him - since the choir is also a church choir - an occasion of the covenant and a letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him over to the office of the German choir band as well as a gravitated singer.
In addition to the honor, the 31. Herbsfested in ordinary trains: With the MGV Betra, the song kranz Salzstette, the singing section of Basingen and the local music concerts, the full-scale mix of different choirs and music styles, which included about 400 visitors.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with voices such as "In the wine paradise" and "Listen, her brother".
Your honor singer Hubert Wermter prepared them for honor a little while - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts "Bundeslied".
The Men's Song Betra is also a classic chorlieder such as "Jägerwengert" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern, as well as the popular song "When you walk through the valley".
The Leeder Kranz Salzstette provided his mixed chor and his female group - the "impulscher" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed chor carried back to foreign languages with the neopolitan populaces "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Anton Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulscher" also spoke back: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing section of the Basinger Sportvein came back to home, where the full-scale music concert is based on the current musical conclusion of Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts "Bierlied".
For the children, there was a small neighboring program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollstimer, led a Kasperltheater up and read a few stories that the children had worked well the afternoon.
Children’s Dreams Become True
The children's activities and children's day-to-day posts in the customs office are available in these days.
The Black Forest Bote wants to support the facilities in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb in the realization of their construction and maintenance needs.
Do the kids need a new sandwich?
In the event of action, all child abuses, child abuses and child abuses can be done throughout the ages.
If you have a construction or cleaning vessel for your installation, you can compete with this in the Black Forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Children's Garden Building.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forests Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all consignments.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be made with a building material in the value of a maximum of EUR 2000 and on a day (action-) of action.
In addition, the winner must provide for many flexible builders themselves.
What about the day of action and the help?
The building house provides material with the support of the scaffolding of Zolleralb.
It will be delivered on the agreed day in the children's gardens and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Help can be parents, grandparents, friends, unity and, of course, the teacher and children themselves.
Kenyan Presses via Controversial Media Act
"We are in a position to settle and we can ask ourselves, 'What is it up to Parliament to create the right independence tomorrow?' was to read in the newspaper, which was not in accordance with the Constitution.
"The law is dramatic and very criminal and we pay it off," said Cyrus Kamau, director of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be taken over, because it is a longer government arm”, and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us and we will appeal to him to cancel this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government adopted the new law "the media effectively in a crisis". On the contrary, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya would have experienced a "hard blow" and meant the project as a "draconic".
The adoption of the Act is a number of measures to strengthen national security following the attacks by armed Islamics at the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media sought to bring the authorities to their senses because they published recordings of security cameras, which were to be seen as the units sent to the tator were reportedly excavated by the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the charge was withdrawn after a press release.
According to the new law, media houses may be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the other risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court also has the right to claim the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single punishment can be inflicted by most radioists in the bankrott. ”
In addition, the timing of the view that these measures could have a devastating effect on their description of "living blogosphere" Kenya.
If they were to throw the media away, politicians could do what they always want.
“No one will ever experience it,” wrote Mutumuma Mathou, a journalist at the nation that named the Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians themselves take the country to the bankrott and bring us back to the time of the judges and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators had in the past brought public attention to themselves.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and set their positive values of about 532,000 Schilling free of charge per month – they are the highest in the world.
Bad doorroom: A dream is true for the FC
In the interest of the city and the football club, the official entertainment party for the artistic sport site was nothing in spite of the cold winding and the rain.
A more pleasant holiday time was available on the last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
That's how all those who came out of the rain screen or could not hold one for any reason.
That went on to the musicians who crossed the festival, just like so many speakers.
Ours was therefore also the FC-President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
Thank you, Mr. Walter Klumpp, who has made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the Community Council, the participating companies and members of the Union.
This is especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rustic renter left 400 square meters of plastic stones for the new way.
This remarkable honorary commitment would also be deserved by Mr Rombach, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Other major words were spoken for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Battle Football League, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a contribution to the youth section of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that constantly repeated weather-conditioning influences in the spring and autumn would replace the original breed area so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first transfers to solve the problem when it was thought about building a third place at the site of the football club or at the real school at the salinsee.
Both of them were retorted.
Six years ago, thinking about setting up an art sport site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were included two years ago when the FC took over the scale in Erbpacht, incurred a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and contributed EUR 104 000 to the country's contribution.
In October 2012, the Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 to the total cost of EUR 560,000, which was fixed.
The construction of the 68-bit 108-metre wide art site was completed on 4 June.
During the three months-long construction phase, 3000 cubic metres were removed, half of which were used for the construction of a narrow bike street.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
This brought together the competent working group in Berlin in the morning.
This includes direct democracy, recruitment of officials and federal police.
The Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions on migration and integration on the morning.
This should include the issue of double citizenship, which has parallel ideas on both sides.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide on a decision - the Union will take a double step.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda on this Friday, the SPD subjected her not to a PKw-Maut required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "Flatrate for diversity and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD trade leader for the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were exchanges on land roads, which are now inconsistencies.
The introduction of a mouse for all Pkw would also be only a first step from the Pronolds view.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germany will be imposed at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing vocals on the holiday grounds
Stuttgart - "When's going to be the right summer again?" In fact, the question of the holiday was not on the Killesberg holiday grounds.

Constance: Breaking after a crash at a snowflake
The accident was reported by the police as a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibizas on Thursday morning, about 20 hours ago, on the left track of the two-six-six-year-old town hall.
Shortly before the crossing, he noted that he was on the left-hand side track in the direction of Stromeersdorfstrasse and changed to the right track.
This led to the encounter with the BMW of a 23-year-old constituencies.
Also damaged was the 19-year-old VW passport running behind the BMW.
In total, about 15000 Sachshads were created, sharing with the police.
The train had to be stopped during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport creates passenger calls from
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Unfortunately, like this, it will not be given any more at Vienna-Schwechat airport in the future.
A large part of the speech gap falls so far - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
The goal of this renewal is to create a more exciting atmosphere.
As airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced on Radio Vienna, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of cross-border events involving individuals.
So, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already on the learning calls.
Through the passage of these waves - in the middle of a day about 200 personal calls by the speakers - it will be easier to arrive at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual cases have been taken relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changes in flight patterns or flight time here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio operator.

Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegane food requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Pirate Tofu with plants, for example, is a quark set.
The vegetarian union is also known as World Day on 1 November.
On 1 November, the vegetarian association Germany proposed a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt lets go through Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, mandel or rice milk could be used.
Upgrading plant sizes replace conventional shells.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
A half-red, rich bananas, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a kitchen.
Also 50 grams of appelmus or a lacquer made together plus three lacquers of water are suitable for this purpose.
Locker is replaced with Ei, for example with a mixture of a teelöfel back powder, a meal of food strength, and three mineral water sludges.
But also 50 grams of Sojajoghurt or seidentofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu report, about 800 000 people are now eating vegan, so clean plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Zald Gymnasium learned about the American capital, New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went off to Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here is already a fascinating view of the world-known Skyline, which makes a special trip in the evening.
By the time break, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but the motto "The city doesn't sleep" was decided the day on Times Square.
Despite Shuttdown, on the second day, the station of freedom was reached with a train and it was opened on foot.
Next came the financial center around the Wall Street at the memorial site on 11 September.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy the view of the Empire State Building, which was 373 meters high.
Then it went through the hettic route of New York's streets over the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offers an ideal opportunity for short distance in the Herbstson.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students arrived in their guest families and enjoyed the school day at Weymouth High School.
Also in this year, a Hubertus messe is celebrated on the day of the name of the Holy Hubertus in the Parish Church of St. Marie on the Hillsberg street.
St. Hubertus was the case after a fair-considered judge who was turned over by a vision and later appointed the bishop of Lüttich.
The Jädhornblöser group of the Jägdreiter Westfallen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is musicd on parforce listeners (natural ears in the mood Es) after old, original French melody.
The glasses carry a row clothing because they prefer to accompany riders, horses and dogs on shoes.
The holiday fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed surface shines with a new coffee.
One who calls for reconciliation and reconciliation.
One who wants to make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu, called Lexikon, it is called a psychological phenomenon that emerges from the feeling that a new situation has already experienced or seen.
In the case of the visit of the same-named Café at the opening in Kreisstadt Kleve in view of the Rhein-Waal High School, it must not remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the coffee with the beautiful name has exactly that objective: a real stay is not only thoughtful but always firm to make it ever again.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into inner life on Revelation 8 gives the viewer a good feeling on the subject.
The high-moded but not cool Café environment looks like a place to feel.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner will rent the guest with different coffee or cocktail variants.
There are expensive kitchens or individually furnished fresh baguattes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before the opening of the beautiful Cafes at the exhibition as a gastronoms: they led the "Art Lounge" in Kranenburg.
The sympathic Café-Liebhabber is more popular from the turn to Kleve at the opening.
Not at all at the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," said Daniel Büttner.
More and more, the two young students here want to address exactly the same as seniors and all seniors.
I'm near Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathic inhaler pair is behind the coffee gene.
Enjoys the duplicating hot blood in the different variations itself.
Expression
Daniel Büttner is more than the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino coacher.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
Two events have already been in the light coffee.
Better say one.
Because the port was already out there - the Café Déjà Vu didn't take advantage of it.
But there was also the ring ring ring ring.
"Good, successful and wise," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not every man's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is also the reason why no fan of an event append: "I can't even do all the right now."
And with an event I always talk to only those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception.
"We want to destroy the whole normal operation as little as possible."
To say, Déjà Vu is also for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the exhibition in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more to a gastronomic environment.
For the joy of many Klever, the guest from and outside and the students who also discover the Café Dédia Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Stiftungsfest to which the MGV "Fridrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the location of the guesthouse "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoy the harmony of each other in the character of the music.
Traditionally, the Foundation's festival is always the appropriate festival to celebrate.
About the special title "Sunger of the Year" this time the writer Rolf Wagener was delighted.
"You have not only written much for us, but you have run so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said Chores Erich Schlotmann's president.
The nominations for participation in the events and trials during the activities of this year were attended by the Cholester Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the Honourable Horst Pier-Ribbert, the president himself, and the last year's "sanger of the year" by Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Place five furnished note waiting Artur Brückner.
A special thanks was directed by the Board to the team of Uninsvirtin Ange Pier Ribbert, which once more had a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Fridrich-Wilhelm" will meet its regular chorpros every day at 19.45 a.m. in the United States.
"New songs of praise are always welcome," said Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will start immediately with the development of a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
In the absence of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which started in Rio de Janeiro at night, Australian diplomats played a key role in the preparation of "Sustainable Development Goals", which will replace the Millennium Goals that will take place in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated on the summit that the time had come to “remember the national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to take up a process to meet the universal and sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the development framework beyond 2015.
I will not be able to exercise this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to make our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been playless for four days, it continues to be a good voice at the handball oberlists.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon doesn't have any doubt about it.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I no longer know how a victory will taste," Malmon expects a success experience from his husband at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-hand reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet removed any trees, Malmon cautions the display finger in advance.
I've trained many players myself in the A-young.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"Then it should be expected if there is further strengthening from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
Finally, in order to return to the success track, the Malmon team must increase in comparison with the previous events in each case.
In front of all things in the cover work and in the replaying game, it was finally violent.
Also, the chance evaluation needs to be definitely better.
So I hope my players have finally got their head free during the short break.
Safety concerns in Mozambique are growing in view of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the growing eyes of the status of Samora Machel, the state founder and the first president of Mozambique to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, manager of an investment firm.
Fearing the future of the country, she joined her business against a T-shirt with the title “We require security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the capital’s independence.
For almost two weeks, there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been the worst since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was the first famous rebel movement to be supported by Rhodesia, originally ruled by white, and later by the Government of South Africa, in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
Following the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will again return to a conflict that has surfaced, but the latest developments have stirred foreign investors and domestics.
For the fast-growing economy, there is a lot to play, as the discovery of large gas projects in the north-west could bring up more than 50 billion US dollars from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Freelimo Party has been the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo has been responsible for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had caused the most recent mergers by attacking its members in Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos province on 17 October.
The remnants of the earlier rebellions, as government troops attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhalaka, the leader of the group, Renamos spoke against the Financial Times.
The government has the responsibility for the co-operation and charges the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reflect on an instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said in the middle of the week that Dhlamaka viewed himself as a “reliefer” who “want to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force his decisions on the government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stressed that they wanted to avoid a war.
However, the doubts have been raised since the words were quoted by Mazanga, namely the 1992 Peace Agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he explained that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and be serious," said Mazanga.
Early talks between the parties have only contributed little to the tension that has been fueled by a number of meetings this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhalaka), who meet the heads," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them are good at negotiating and nobody is ready to make the necessary arrangements.
Renamo, who insists on electoral reforms, has already declared that it will celebrate the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and Parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to prevent a cross-border movement, resulting in the government's consent and financial benefits.
Renamos election has broken down since 1992, while a new party, which was founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democratico de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – its return – is due when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want multilateral democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has taken unsustainable attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the power was found in the province of Sofala, some hundred kilometers north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the port, mountain construction companies like Rio Tinto and Vale used to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the street.
Mazanga replied repeatedly to the question whether Renamo will resume this drug.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique were not good," said Mazanga.
Insatiability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been worried about corruption, slow progress in development and short-term leadership.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the country's future and should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrators, said that people wanted only stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads," he explained.
Children should be given myth and legend as a “model for life”, that is, a author.
The stories of Thor showed that "Brutal Power has no chance against clever tricks", and the Artus legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were “to be too wild, too aggressive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught at school,” why Crossley-Holland complained about an old-fashioned career.
"I think it's wonderful that in America Mythen and Folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing this for twenty years as a plan.
He added to the authors and teachers who would be “over-deductive” children would “completely turn off” as the messages would “simply” be transmitted in continuous stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowulf from English and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "I can follow certain ideas, but it should be kept in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is in need of hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or led to a happy end, but there is an immeasurable sense of good and evil.
This must be shown in detail, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of story.
Hanskob is still in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjab took his old-fashioned seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were spent in the "Frehehof".
Many visitors were impressed by the extremely short-lived stage game.
From the arrival of the grant of honor to his death, Drehbuchautor and Hansjab manufacturer Alois Kraftzzyk had designed a continuous piece, which came under the reign of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker with the ten different scenes, explained relationships, and interrupted the youth from the youth to the next retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjab came home to his children's tomb, in his own home.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his paradise role as the great son of the city.
He presented Erich Becherer from Mühllenbach with the two-pane and the "Black-dark Fuchs" of Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received from the audience with much applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann is incredibly well aware of the role of the sister in moving into the role of the sister and she misses her precious life in Miami and Gestic.
Between the individual scenes, the mühlenbacher farmer hat played a suitable choice of musical pieces and thus round the performance.
Then, for the grant of honor to the mayor, Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honor that had been held in the presence of the former governor, Heinz Winkler, together with a part of the city court.
Their expectations were followed by the trikönig-song singer, whom Hansjab called out: "But how beautiful it is that memories of my own trikönig will be alive again."
With her song "O Jesúslein" they enjoyed the audience in the open hall as well as the star-day girls with their singing "Heraus, Heaus".
His criticism at the office had then expressed exactly how his thoughts about the changes in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the houseyard, behind his graveyard on the fire at the courthouse, he found his place of rest.
"An unclean spirit had finally found his peace and was always gone," it said at the end of the scene.
Many applaus and many words of praise were given by the public for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Riesen grows
The opportunities for the remaining league of the sports-based Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer have increased.
Because there should be a Wildcard procedure, then there is now less a competitor for the Neckar Riesen.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project is based on an application for a possible retreat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hanse City since 2012.
However, the first opinion was not to be taken from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't work with the Wildcard process, so long it doesn't seem that Düsseldorf won't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, raisers of Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Court of Justice and demonstrate its economic integrity to the Federal Republic of Germany.
So far, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence but twice.
The Court of Justice is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Night-time skirmishes turn to the point of view
As a contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office devoted the last of its annual public topics to Sunday, October 27, the evening festival.
After the visit of the Atomkeler Museum, the Haigerlocher time should be considered after 1850, when the Haguerlog came under Persian rule.
The Krönner endpoint is a visit in the night sky.
There the leading participants receive the history of the church building and gain insights into the development of the Evangelical community in a Catholic area.
In the church, there is also the view of Friedrich Schrz, with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter, created evening meals.
It is an original reproduction of the famous enamel model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The second half-hour tour is about 15 hours at the Atomkeler Museum.
There are maps in the box of the nuclear museum.
For questions and information, the city's Tourist Office is available in the city of Haigerlog.
Snowden could also be found in Russia
Former U.S. Secretary of State Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian Asyl speech in the US press.
Representatives of the Federal Government could either ask written questions or meet in Russia for 30 years.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency on non-known circles that were trusted with the position.
Such a question could be clarified in a matter of public opinion.
An island of Snowdens from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case he lost his refugee status," the Agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is the United States connector, dear Snowden there the delivery went on.
Longer Attenuate Pays
Six men fought at the Tennis Tower of the Union for the victory title.
Finally, the team of the Maier/Bronner chose the last match.
A dreammaker had received the Tennis division of the sports friends Rohrdorf to turn the local units and friends.
The fun of tennis games was in front of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or maximum 45 minutes duration.
Anja Lighter leads the tournament
The tour guide was in the hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a afternoon break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites of Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner made the same decision with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmic (two teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory, Carmen Müller was finally able to pass the Wanderpokal to Andre Mayer/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target site.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier arrived at the Asphalriecher team.
In late afternoons and coffees and kitchens, the successful explanation of the tournament took place.
In the last week of August, the Black Forest Museum of Freedom is again located in Gutach, near Hornberg, in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program to a beautiful child and family party with numerous co-operations and events.

Burt is not to be deprived of his dream despite a heart failure.
With his spare parts, a couple of cents and a mortgage on his old workshop shoes, he sails by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film, there are coffee, tea and kitchens.
Schrilles Piepsen ruins residents
Rehenus Midgard has also invested heavily in the country.
They distribute the coal from the ships to the docks.
The company has several eggs in the fire at the location.
In addition to the coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is based on wind-lagen logistics.
Black shines the coal on the storage site before the deich.
Split or download the cool here, if necessary, two powerful blue hold-and-recharge devices.
In each movement of the trans-shippers, a sharp warning noise falls over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are legally prescribed," says Matthias Schrell, director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the midst of an unsatisfied wind, it is sad to hear it - and thus there have already been some complaints from people from the city.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the accused, says the 40-year-old.
In a discussion with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals free of any technical measures.
In the future, he will also focus on the open dialogue with his neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell has something else ahead of his place.
With the development of the Dutch bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-verified liigawanen in the form of the terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be carried out here as long as possible.
"In this year we want to cross the 3 million tonnes mark in the contest," said Schrell.
In addition to the Eon-Kraftwerk, the imported coal goes to power plants in the country.
If the GDF-Suez craft still goes to the network, well 5 million tons of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three ships on the bridge as well as the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns Basketballer Despite First Download Optimistic
Even the first landing in the Euroleague could not slow down the huge optimism of the FC Bayern Munich basketball player.
"No one can ban us from winning the best team of Europe in the past two years," balanced Bayern-Coch Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday at the titled Olympic Prize.
We have sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichns were sold very well for a long time, but they were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages.
At first, the guests managed to turn the piece of art into a 15-point retreat 13 minutes before the end, before the prize again gave the game a turn.
"We have certainly fought back against the double Euroleague champion, but then again made slight mistakes," said Bayern-Professor Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful authors of the Munichn, who in the first two parties celebrated prominent victories against the Italian seriesmaster Montepaschi Siena and the Polish titler Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the variable artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, was working to tell the number of directly witnesses in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the year, Fays innovation was developed, such as at the New York Comedy Festival.
Called and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standing-up institution Carolinas, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixteen shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners joined Carolinas and were always more successful until they were once known to be in a club,” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are events by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy beneficing event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springstone, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who attended this year's festival have become more aware of non-conventional ways, such as sending to smaller television stations such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was introduced with a seatcom in cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and has now its own chess show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the crew both at "Saturday Night Live" and at "Parks and Recreation" although she is the most famous for her official video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of the American Comedy.
The largest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but developed into a watched television and film director as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he updated a television broadcast entitled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” on TV Country.
The meeting takes place in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that if he's here, he sometimes goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose my whole money, then maybe I'll live here."
Iran is satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran will show itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN-veto powers and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to resolve the differences in recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschwad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
However, it would be a longer way, but the nuclear operator would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Killed Game Cameras with Machete
In Uruguay, two children arrested the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14- and 12-year-olds had invited their victims to go with them to the birdjagd.
With machetes and messers armed, they replaced the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the Leichnam into a bridge, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Next, they would have played in a four-day football field before their apartments.
The Leichnam was discovered on the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach Punta del Este.
When Alibi was supposed to be a five-year-old half-brother of the disciple who had taken her with them, she should have been sexually assaulted by the boys.
But when the girl described the incident without mentioning an attack against her before the police, the two boys added the anticipated death of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the old man, among others, announced a rivalry in football game.
He was temporarily introduced to a psychiatric youth institution.
Payments must be entered in prison
Because of alien trafficking in human beings, wages, threats, training and dangerous bodily injury, the Land Court of Constance has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen for three hundred years.
The former Federal Army soldier who worked after two investments in Afghanistan as a doorsteher made a statement in the course of a process hearing.
At the same time, in five cases, he knew women about Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the strike after a few weeks.
He was determined to break free from violence and drugs.
He kept the impressions of the women who had been appointed for him for part of the year.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he linked women's contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who communicated with the women, he brought them to different boards in the south.
There he had them monitored to check their findings.
Before the trial, the accused first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after his colleagues in Afghanistan had come to him in an explosion about life.
After a serious doubts about the psychological limitation and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-olds gave up a comprehensive position.
The court did not have to take any more of the injured women.
As reported by a Krypo agent, at least four other cases of human trafficking could be reported after a first announcement by telephone surveillance measures.
The hearings have been caused by high aggression.
In later acquisitions, the damages had confirmed her martyrium.
Another witness, one of the women who had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not made a statement until today.
It deals with "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this Mediterranean as normal.
The accused questioned his conduct yesterday.
"He has released himself from these circles and wants to lead a very normal life after the port," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to $96 per Barrel
The oil price has also fallen on Friday, following concerns about a high offer over a report, which increases the energy-intensive manufacturing sector of China.
The reference oil supply resorts in December later came to Europe in the electronic trade in New York Mercantile Exchange at 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell to 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a drop in prices of 5.8 percent in October.
The large oil supply has charged the prices in the past few weeks.
The US Ministry of Energy announced that the US bid had reached 4.1 million barrels last week.
Within five weeks, the offer increased to 25 million Barrel.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of a stronger demand by two reports on an activity growth in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, which was estimated at 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, after reaching the lowest rate in the previous quarter of two decades.
Roh oil from the kind Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, also used by US-American refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
Jurisdiction Blocked Decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Fridge Directive
On Thursday, a federal court in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had called for changes in the Stop-and-Frisk Programme ("Keeping and Search") of the New York Police Department, and based on the case.
The US Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be made until the city had decided on a profession.
In August the judge had condemned the city against the Constitution in the way and how the programme for the agreements and questions of persons would be implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the proposed aid measures, including the decision, to set up a monitoring centre to support the police in amending its Directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the exemption.
The vocational report stated that the judge had to be excluded from the case because he had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of participation; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which he had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unjustly targeted by black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frick program.
It designated an external position to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service oversight, and organized a pilot programme with cameras carried out on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was ready to end the practice of saving names and addresses of persons who were again released by the police after a check.
An oral discussion on the occupation of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk approach has been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this type have been in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded during the office of the shared mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to a total of 684.330 in 2011, mostly black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
In support of changes in the NYPD's stop-and-frick programme, the changes will end in numerous practices and create a more reliable and effective police and affect the manner and manner of applying the regime.
On the contrary, the view that the changes would affect the moral of the police, but not the criminality, would also waste money and not solve the wider problem of a police, which, after the death of thousands of people in the last decade, is under pressure.
The Director pointed out that it does not end the stop-and-frick-praxis, which is constitutional, but only reform the way in which the controls are implemented by the NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camel
Happiness is an oasis that only reaches dreaming camels
With this insight, the first president, Wolfgang Hen, described the history and fiction of the "Helping Hands".
On Saturday, the tenth birthday of the Union was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first president of the Union reported his excellent report on the work of the Union.
In 2004, he was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation was developed, and the Gynaecologist had performed numerous operations on several trips.
During the talks, images of the applications were shown on a large canvas so that the guests could make a picture of the event of the above-mentioned actions.
The west vehicle of the Union was also shown.
It's a former federal defence vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic system and now, according to her, should be engaged together in the advisory function.
In 2008, the roommate Schleeh from Baiersbrunn in the record time of nearly a week created the hospital in Socogim, an estate district near the capital.
She also mentioned a new mother child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when birth clinics are to be vegrarianized in Nagold.
You have learned a lot in Africa as a doctor, so she is, for example, a discharge against burnout.
Because of political unrest in the country, many travel as planned was not possible, but many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
In addition, in March this year, medical devices, medicines, bind materials, hospital beds and glasses are regularly sent to Africa.
Mititiatitor Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a lot of local colorry by telling from Mauritania the Mercedes vehicles built around the mobile wall and depicting the experiences of the native musicians who traditionally supported the union during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he announced his work in the field of accounting as a young rapporteur.
When it became clear how much money was lost on the way, he had decided to help Africans in controlling a budget by the people.
In addition, it was stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It's not far to Africa from Gran Canaria.
Coulson set phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson set out “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip on a case by the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
State attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World, in May 2005, that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive Special Adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper urged the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hunt Pawlbys Voicemails, and followed her, but Coulson also called on and left messages as the court experienced.
“In the view of state administration, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the needW, is no one who stands in front of people’s apartment and hopes to get them to a fresh start, but one who wants people to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said that NotW used three methods to research stories in research: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows from the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
How does it look with the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking order?
He argues, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Accrued on an affair, Clarkes was initially quoted as a source of sexual interest in Pawlby, saying: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on the Pavlby and her sister as “projects”.
In the time when the researchers lived, the grandparents of Pavlby received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were monitoring the movement of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her voicemail with the following: “I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I want to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blonket.
The complainants heard on Thursday that Coulson Blackett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was in love with the mythical Rebecca Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks are trying to make a difference with others, to pick up a phone between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rain tax, the French football is actually the first fight since 1972.
A blinding effort goes unproductive to the end.
In the conflict about the rain tax, the government and the professional football in France have managed after a failed strike in a tank gas.
President François Hollande responded on Thursday in Paris, Elysée-Palast United and Associated Representatives and their complaints were heard.
However, he refused to lose the Fussball from the planned 75 per cent commission on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained warm.
The fight announced for the end of November will now be carried out, with Jean-Pierre Louvel, the Chief of the Professional Association (UCPF).
The game days referred to in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 shall therefore expire between 29 November and 2 December.
Concentration: No absolute protection possible
"We want to join the residents early in the planning," opened mayor Jens Häutsler the citizens' information event for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the Community Hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, think out and bring ideas.
Hößler made it clear that "the final decisions are the members of the Council".
The spring water, which fell on May 15, 2009, was an unprecedented event that raised the issue of protection measures for the future, as was the case with Hößler.
A river area survey was commissioned by the neighboring village Adilings, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The best possible protection is the goal," said the Hautler.
Based on the planning of protection before a known German weather service, all 100 years of high water is expected.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent proposal.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima" in professional circles.
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in 2009 in Gheingen, represent a 1000-year-old high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved," he said.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aKlima protection, around EUR 4 million must be invested in gheating, where the community can calculate land-uses by around 70 per cent.
However, Hößler pointed out that only if a whole concept is implemented will be provided.
To this end, the Community should be indicated on the impact of the citizens.
An exciting planning and authorisation procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which has already been presented in the Community in the past week (we have reported) provides for local measures under the influence of the river Irm from the native valley.
In connection with the presentation of the High Water Protection Convention, the participants used the opportunity to present their cases.
Among other things, it was asked why no more dams and backups were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the designated engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that the combination of all the measures proposed is necessary to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, if you were to find the most economic solution, Joachim Wald of Wald and Corbe.
Immut ruled in the case of senior officials who, even in normal winters, have been subjected to a recharge of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Hößler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for high water protection and that this should not be mixed.
The Community shall be obliged to provide the channel network with a view to strengthening two to three-year regenerative events.
The water canals are larger in size, and millions would be different.
Injured by summary
On Friday morning, two drivers were seriously injured on the ground street near Ravensdorf during a front-end meeting.
The police stopped the road completely immediately, but they could say a little bit about the accident.
However, there are different testimony cases that should be assessed first.
It is estimated that the 19-year-old lenkerin of a VW Golf in the direction of Ravensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf attacked her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles fell together, where the woman was so heavily trapped that the fireman needed almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle.
The actual accident remained unexplained at first.
Both of the victims arrived in nearby hospitals.
The track was completely closed about two hours ago.
You could call him the U.S. Dostojewski.
Philip K. Dick was a Gothic, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have a series.
Striking the bond in the outside: the rising eyes, the bar, the high stars.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologetic of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who has something to do with his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassettes are distributed with 118 stories in the second half of the year.
Dick explains America - to be chosen by the kingdom of the stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, safety wall and faith.
Dick had divine experiences, his later books read as a blend from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugged his brain.
He's got it, early that the computers are divine.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator of his creation.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
It's killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A great writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minimumity Report" comes from 1956, and it inspires the spirit of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
This is where the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "Pre-Crime", so what is between more or less official doctrine of the white house.
In Dick's world, which resembles our gruesome, mutants look at the future and touch the police.
"We find individuals who have not understood any law," says the chief of the Authority.
"We will cut them off before they can commit a crime of violence."
And, "In our society, there are no major offenders, so we have a criminal full of pesudian offenders." You read time stream.
They believe that crime is happening, and they prevent criminal thinking from being translated into practice.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror gestures and the NSA hearing.
Anticipation of the approach: So does Obama Drohnen-Philosophy and Praxis.
But Dicks Story isn't over yet.
The police chief regrets that there is no further division of power, the military controls every day - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is running.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
There are his own requirements.
Irrrtums and victims are not only in purchases, but are built on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Philip K. Dick reads, always comes closer to the truth.
Säähäffäääre about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. Secretary-General Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian Asyl statement in the US press about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal government could either ask written questions or meet in Russia for the 30 years, the Agency reported Interfax.
Earlier, the Green Federation's president Hans-Christian Strebele had met in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician Snowden to talk to him about the affair.
Strengthening NSA reconciliation due to State surveillance
On a peaceful day at the end of August, a German police officer flew over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Federal Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism Agency (BVT), the German Interior Service, he should photograph the U.S. External Post roof, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of monitoring agents and the action led to a change in the terms between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again said in September that the United States did not use the possibility of foreign spying, "to hold the secrets of foreign companies in the U.S. order, so that they could develop their international competitiveness or gain."
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become a member of the White House, started publishing his full-time U.S. surveillance secrets to U.S. government and business leaders, they are no longer sure if they can take the Director for a word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency inspired the Brazilian Petrobas oil company and created data from American cloud suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new highest level due to state surveillance.
The fascism led to the conclusion that Chancellor Angela Merkels had been on the phone for perhaps ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be seen as a visitor, the company's leadership is certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that this data will be used for mutual use.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Green, president of the BITMI, the small and medium IT firm in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now poses almost as great risks as China when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, a question published in July by the EY consultant company.
However, in the documents provided by Snowden, there was no indication that the United States had continued its business secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the USA.
In this respect, the companies are skeptical.
On Friday we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly...
"This doesn't work," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal through cars to agriculture.
It's all up to the IT branch.
However, the vast and technical refining of the U.S. spy authorities, which had previously seen the largest spying risk in China, have been shocked.
Cloud Computing is a major change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to the existing legal framework and are therefore potentially dangerous.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade agency, a survey conducted by the U.S. Data Mining Activities with Prism is about 10 per cent of U.S. members planning to use an American provider.
Jim Snape, Deputy Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who haven’t given it a year ago – they say: Where will my data be stored and you can guarantee that these physical remains in this area of law?”
Many German corporate leaders present views that confirm the latest reports simply what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to keep their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be kept at every price.
It is not surprising that economic spying takes place.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The company's management usually does not take action against the measures taken, because it brings benefits to the victims.
In large companies, employees have long pointed out that the company of a free USB stick on a show or the unexpected location of a laptop in the hotel room is not reasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Manufacturers of Audi, says that it has been part of the standard practice for years before a Board meeting to collect the phones so that they can't be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT is able to use control forces to make easy use of prepaid handys when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid Handys will be removed later.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in their respective industries.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," the BVT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimates in February France, Russia and Israel back in China were organized into two countries that served to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic spying, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former leader of the French Interior Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are to spy out their allies."
Heatingen: Messe answers to hochtimes questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery journey that humans can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, like at least the wedding party, now had a special event in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around the time of the wedding.
A trend: Retro-look has been re-entered.
It starts with the wedding dressers.
White is a must, best covered or in cream.
The fronts are many cuts and covered clothes with stickers, often with a sleigh, on the back they go down the back and end often in a bed.
However, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch points out from the fashion house clothing furniture.
The approach with West and Plastic is dominated by the masters, but it can also be chosen creamy or brown combinations.
It's important to choose the location, it's explained.
Beautiful nearby rooms are not optimal, the environment should be especially.
Here the domain focused on its own offer in the Remission.
Anyone who wants to proceed with the kitchen has an offer for Uwe Link.
"Cuts are also popular for young people," he says.
Romantics are also asked for admission cards, flower arrangements and for wedding photos.
The "After-Weding-Photo" is increasingly available in fashion - so the reception fairs in special places, mostly about water accidents, a few days after the party, but in high-time fashion, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangements, ring, wedding table, kitchen and also a vendor, such as Marko Ripper, who can keep guests in a stylish manner.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and needles.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dogfriends Successful
For the rest of the time, the sportsmen of the dog's friends, Bitz, were successful at a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his hündin Sandy, he scored 94 points in the first class and secured the fifth place, and with 15 months old Marley brought it with 87 points in place twelve.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in Class 1, took the critical views of the Executive Director.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believed in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a co-founded Ringermatt in the tournament of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. federal state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a straight-up mat that stood behind the tribune in the school hall.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lounds County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, however, which doubled the family of the 17-year-olds.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They had never believed he had died as the sheriff had succeeded.
"They are the view that every logic is hidden from the laws of physics as well as from the healthy human mind," said Crump.
They were more confident that the truth would be betrayed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back to the gym," he commented.
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation of Johnson's death, since a number of important questions remain unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Should his death be brought back to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I took the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of a “positional recovery”.
A second autopsy, however, has resulted in another cause of death, such as Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will be responsible for carrying out investigations by the FBI.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready for a comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that were checked by the investigators.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC publication of allegories for schools
On Wednesday, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the treatment of food allergens of children in schools.
These are the first of these directives issued by the U.S. government, since the number of children who are pregnant with food allergy increases.
One of 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The distribution of food allergens among children has increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergens and how to interact with children, the allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have prepared Epinephrin – the self-injection of the epiPen brand is most often used – in order to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the Federal States have recently amended the rules so that schools can easily keep Epinephrin ready.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that are called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like it's pushing something on my teeth”, “My teeth feel like a hair on it” or,“My teeth are shaking.”
Parents of intersex children can choose "Sex Undecided"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with non-explained genitalia.
Newborns will no longer be assigned to older men or women.
Under the new law, parents must no longer explain sex to such children, but they can “undefined” or “not established” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to pressure parents so that they do not have to face cross-border decisions regarding operations for sexual orientation in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
An intersexual person said to BBC years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm still tired of the flashwork created by doctors, and I'm tired and full of noses.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children does not come to the world as a young child or as a girl every year.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “sex-diversity disorder” (SDD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomal, chemorrhythmia (eirstoms or hodens) or unusual genetics.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is not yet very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend that the best available information be used for sex education, if a provision is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
The New York Psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of sex identification, said that the new German law "sucks to a good thing".
Intersexual children exhibit an ethical dilemma.
"Some people may have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but for most children it is not worth it," he said.
You can perform a sexual orientation without surgery and then wait for how identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret, why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission of 2011, it is meant to distinguish intersexual persons from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not sexual, but is required by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in rare sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, storage, breasts and structure, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genetics or chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination against persons with intersexual and transgender backgrounds and of the extent of abuse, violence and prejudice.
Not with the sex picture, the boys are now having a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal for adults, it is possible to refer to official documents both male, female or "third gender".
In June Australia, Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “unsexual” person in the world after a court granted the long-term maintenance of a “undefined” marital status.
In addition to M and W, Germany has a third assignment, X for intersexual, such as the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France sex topics are still controversial, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French officials of the hard Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “Geschlechtertheory” from schoolbooks.
The U.S. Catholic online website also spoke against the German law, reasoning: "If the world is shaken into a new state where sex represents a decision, but not sexual activity, then we will risk two more deaths of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared against Baby Zone that she would do better if babys would be given a sex at birth.
"The fact that parental care is also hard enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the child's gender," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sex parts were named Hermaphrodite after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, the medicine considered sex to be something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt.
However, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubled after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when raising the child with the gender assigned to them.
“In the 20th century, one called it a “psychiatry emergency”, said Drescher.
If such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.
The overwhelming theory of the treatment of children with unclear genetics goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, who shares the view that sex is terrible.
He discussed the concept of “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental threats – such as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and argued whether a person was considered male or female.
However, in a case known as “John/John” since 1966, his theories were controversial.
He calls upon the parents of a young man whose pension was cut off when a failed pregnancy took place, to cast the child away completely and also to remove his bones and then to raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion which he was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to male sex and married a woman.
But he committed suicide on my 38th.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have joined the public, who are “not happy with the result”.
So about Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY-human chromosomes, but two-year-old genetics.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the hoden were removed soon after the birth of 1976 surgically and he was taken as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained against ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew he didn't agree, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genetics.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections and was able to remove his breasts.
The operation has made him unproductive.
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to take intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Legal Group Advocates for Informational Choice in California, ensures that the German law can “encourage to stamp and stamp out.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision may encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a ‘not established’,” she explained.
We were afraid it would benefit intervention.
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
However, we still do not know how the law will affect itself, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to recognise as a third sex”.
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex”, she explained.
The German law applies to the designation of birth.
That's not a fight you should force little children at this time.
If they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Burstradiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual disparity disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law “complete” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have an earring and no ear wound.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the Child Psychiatry.
Although she is unborn, however, she hopes to be able to obtain a child by adoption or by a nurse.
"The law gives parents a room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to make different tests and clear things and gives them time to write them “human” or “female”.
In this way it's all right – you kiss the child big and love it.
You've got a wonderful baby and you're enjoying your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to take over an operation that doesn't get back.
"This concludes the children in the decision with one and eliminates the fear of the parents because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that best suits him – and that is wonderful.
This will allow children to make their own decision.
Unknown girls hurt by noise from car
Unknown people have hurt a dozen-year-old in case of injuries from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children with air pressure at Donnerstagbend in Genthin.
That's what the police in Burg shared.
The girl was easily injured on the left wall.
Salvation forces brought the girl into the hospital.
The committee came from a small car that had been handed over to a group of six children and had been held suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The workers also shot at a bus stop.
A ship broke.
Next, they heard about it.
The criminal police identified it on Friday.
Until now, police inspection teams can look back at a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to attack children, who fought against domestic violence.
Since the owners of the house recognized this at the same time and the owners of the estate were not likely to have any damage.
In addition, some Sylvester powders were also planted in the city area, but there was no damage here either.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer street reported that his Pkw was developed with cloppy and his radar lights were used.
Until the police arrived, however, the man discovered his radar lights in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to act anymore.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream house.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with many greens, an old building, nice neighborhoods and not too much traffic.
There are only a few minutes of public transportation in the city.
"They hope no fear of spins?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing at a tight spin on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how hard it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spinne phobia, but the concern, in old age, can no longer manage the many steps to the house and the apartment.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the midwife has had to learn what it means to move with handicap from Stockwerk to Stockwerk.
Before long, a book from her appeared on the subject 'Happy to live in age - What kind of residence is best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on in old age' she begins to tell.
When she and her husband moved to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today with mid-five, Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
However, she also knows that she is one of the few people who are quite familiar with the subject of 'dwelling in age'.
Most of the time, it's gone.
Everything will always be just the others', she says funnyly.
Only when the pressure is really big can you think about it.
'Then it can be too late,' said Ries.
In her book, the interior architecture features 17 housing models for an individual residence in the old age.
'What kind of life you choose, however, is always an individual decision,' she explains.
D i e solution is not provided for age.
Even those who can afford the old-fashioned residence in the Toscana or the Brittany should always assume that he can also get sick.
And, 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, you are also united in Dolce Vita,' the author of the bookstore wishes to add.
Among its models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted interestr WG.
In age, everyone has his tickets and makeup.
'There would be no such a community for me,' they say with a blind eye.
Not even like in a student-WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'In old age you just need his back rooms', so rice.
However, that an older community can function, the bookoutor does not want to be excluded.
But this has to go differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, she thinks.
In this opinion, at least she is not alone in the capital city.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for so long,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the leader of the civil service in the age of the capital.
Your service tells people around the topic 'to become older'.
That is why even older people would often also buy inconsistencies and restrictions in order to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation.
Today there are many opportunities to design the house or the apartment freely.
Ries recommends that all who work with the age-righted construction of their house or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly once and not to hire the best handsman.
Today there is also for the older-right construction specialists.
Even in the apartment, it can be realized one or the other, and if it is only the increase in the toilet, the interior architecture is clear.
But the existing apartment is not always entitled to age and can therefore be redesigned freely even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
However, within the apartment a steplift could be installed, which would also be the biggest obstacle to the entrance to the apartment.
She will search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before turning around, you're more fun than you're looking at your apartment.
USA wants to prosecute Snowden further
The United States has not changed its attitude towards former U.S. Secretary of State Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be asked to provide confidential information.
So he had to take a criminal procedure in the United States, said the US Foreign Ministry spokesman Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would the latest remarks of Snowden be changed.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian had called on the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to continue threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that there were strong objections to the hand of a parliamentarian and not the German member of the government.
The secret service provider Edward Snowden is basically ready to speak with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This has been made clear in a non-addressed letter by the former NSA worker from the United States who published the Green Politicians Hans-Christian Strebel on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and sent to the federal government, Bundesag and General Bundesan.
After a translation of columns, the text reads as follows:
On behalf of the parties
I was asked to write to you about your examination of mass monitoring.
My name was Edward Joseph Snowden, and earlier he was engaged in a direct operation as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I was a witness to systematic violations of my government, which forced me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these thoughts, I saw myself being exposed to a difficult and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am now living in exile and enjoying the comforts of asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have applied to a system of comprehensive supervision that no one is responsible for as a public service.
Many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the pre-disputed abuse of public confidence were intended to be put into practice.
The benefit of the company from these acquired knowledge is increasing; at the same time, the risks taken in the purchase have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my government still deals with this as a confidence strike and then seeks to criminalise and prosecute political opinion.
Yet, speaking the truth is not a sin.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will take this stand.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are related, I will be able to take part in the responsible statement of the case with regard to the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, and in accordance with the law.
I am pleased to speak with you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to ensure international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden is involved by Hans-Christian Strebele
Child garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Mayer of Winterlings.
The former children's gardens in the garden street have sold the municipality to a private person.
The sale was agreed by the House at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owners to a "adjusted" price.
"The community is satisfied," stressed Mayer.
The budget amounted to EUR 100 000.
It's still not clear how the new owner wants to use the former children's gardens.
The mayor is right that winterlings have given the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to come up for the maintenance of the house, how to warm up to look after the garden and to clean up the wall.
"This attack is gone now," she rejoices.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music room Hammereisenbach offers a concert on the terrace of the guesthouse Hammer.
When Director Bianca Willmann has the tank at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 audiences are satisfied with the voices of Hammeric musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music.
Honeck thanked all who had helped to handle the first music hockey successfully.
Report: Obama campaign moved to replace prayers by Hillary Clinton
The youngest advisers of President Barack Obama have been in secret to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election battle by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.
The enthusiast is the most significant surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long-term work on the 2012 election campaign, “Dubble Down: Game Change 2012”.
The time is before a copy of the first letter appeared, and she reported on the Thursday afternoon that the president's superiors had conducted “suppressive group meetings and questionnaires at the end of 2011” to find out if it would look better for Obama’s quick hope of re-election if he fell in prayer.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book focuses primarily on the history of the efforts of the campaign's leading staff and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has had on the requisition of former Foreign Minister Clinton against the vice presidents.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the most recent advisers of the President – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former head of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the expected change.
In “Dubble Down” it is claimed that Daley had stood at the top of the effort to exchange her “sound, personal relationship” in spite of the fact that it was decided against such a shock, after the data showed that the candidate Clintons would “not significantly improve the chances of Obamas”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government has actually succeeded in replacing requests by Clinton.
"I drew up a whole series of things you should consider, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
We must bear in mind that the President at that time had a terrible requisition, so we thought: “To God’s will, what shall we do?"
While Daley called the investigations “obtained care”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, there was a great deal of pressure to find out whether such a train was paying off on the wafers.
"In campaigns, not much money will be spent on questions and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin explained at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he had asked Daley if his immediate boss had been aware of the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff said that if it was possible, Obama had been aware of it.
Martin added that “Dubble Down” did not give a definitive answer to the question whether the political probes had reached Obama in writing.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know about the tests if prayer should be made in the election.
"Possible," said Martin.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
If the Internet service's e-mail is designed, is the letter secret technically translated in the normal post?
In the design of the early Internet services, communication was essential.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account in creating a stable foundation for a secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a usual e-mail is more than an open mail card than a printed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers connected directly?
The e-mail program or Anna's browser sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider using the Benni.
On the street the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the contents to his provider.
Are regular e-mails being shared on their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots.
When providing the sender, the mail is usually checked whether the mail is accompanied by a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also provided on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider will check whether it is a read-only spam mail that is being deleted or at least deleted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benny communicate via GMail about their upcoming trip, Google can include links to holiday offers.
Do you also read e-mails to strangers?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading a mail is extremely low.
It's theoretical, but it's possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to receive e-mails or to take notice.
Possible illegal spy actions will come to this end.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from the abuse?
With a encryption after the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against encryption.
With high technical pressure it is also possible to transmit the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to identify who has communicated with it.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google will play only a sub-ordinated role in investigating Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the parts of Yahoo mail were last dropped, GMail was clearly able to access Google.
Mother breaks into the forest and rents interest
When his busy mother died, a man from Wolfsburg broke a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their interest and money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after police investigation.
First, he lost the death of 89 years of age, then he spent more than half a year on the money.
Now the 67-year-old must answer because of fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
That night the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At the time, no drugs were needed for the pregnant mother.
The investigator told the renter that his mother was moving to Spain.
Because the officials did so in a remarkable way, they continued to notice.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had been living with them for the last time.
The 67-year-old finally ruined his mother's death.
According to the police, an occupation did not give rise to capital crime.
A light on ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first light ice in the dark – with the help of qualls.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the seabed and created a light cure.
The idea came to him after he had read research on Quals and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the light protein.
The eiscreme reacts to the injection with the ring, thereby increasing the pH in the protein and releasing the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the heat in his mouth and shines – the more you wear it, the more light it will be.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and then two grams are obtained for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the ring at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months, and it seemed ideal for us to bring it to Halloween to the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the metal light material is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes nice.
Charlie's experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, which include beer, cheese, beef and butter.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and on account of the lack of light produced by ice crystals, which is made up of ice cream, but I am convinced that we will find an opportunity to create it.
The icescreen uses the fluorescent properties of a cell that is artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still six days after playing without any point in the handball tie.
It is now scheduled for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last week.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers said optimistically.
Finally, he has his complete framework, with the exception of the persecuted Hendrik Bloom.
The same is true of Daverden.
That is why we need to keep our error rates low.
Firstly, however, it is appropriate to increase in coverage, which has left everything else than a safe impression.
There is clearly a more relaxing view of the Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz after the first season against Nordhorn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby it can always happen.
However, Panitz wants to stay in Morsum now to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat.
To this end, the A-Young Joost Windsout, who is active with double-playing at the A-Young Bundeslist HC Bremen, celebrates its season bet.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffel.
In the last two years, I have not yet declared myself to be able to share my apartment with others, and it will probably not be done this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black creature that's dealing with Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exactly – celebrate Halloween this year and spend 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, such as the US-American Union of Single Dealers (NRF).
One thing I'm happy about every Halloween then again is the trend values.
Costs will be made out of approximately 1.2 billion US dollars spent, as is the NRF.
In this year, there are rising unreceptive objects of the last step.
Women don't have to sleep in sexy clothes anymore, they can also eat delicious foods like pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I know that the Daft-Punk-Weltermans will be created this year in the Instagram feed.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexen.
I'm afraid it's nothing to do with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone in my boots.
In fact, Americans give $330 million this year for the costumes of their pets, like the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as we're concerned, we're not clumsy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are some 270 million kilograms of chocolate, lutschers, bonbons and rubber bars.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Trade, 41 million people who take the phrase “Süßes or Saures” through the quarter.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do not want to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugarcandy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, so the National Association of Sugar Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion masculins.
It's a puzzle that I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing else belongs to Halloween as a housewife.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized sponsors in the United States who earn 500 million dollars off, so America hangs, and that concludes the wonderful photos on which you just tap into the house and then put friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the type on which you are, leave a comment like "after facial expression".
But we'll finally get to the cherubs.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the big kurbis when we were children, and the cutting of a kurbilite is like the beauty of the Christmas tree – something we have done from little to little.
Fortunately, the "Baby in the Kürbis" trend began in the last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us are raised to correct the Kürbis and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans spend about 106 million dollars on corn, so the U.S. Census Bureau.
The circulatory system, which slows down in the front yards, is probably derived from Illinois, where this year is cut to 245 million kilograms of corn.
If you want the right points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut off some of their 921 kilos of heavy beer.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Retrepreneurred bodies
The fire department had to exit at the late Thursday afternoon in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the county of Hof is set on fire in the night.
The rescue forces raise a sick body from the house.
Salvation forces have found a sickly body in a three-family home at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it's about a resident is still unclear, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday afternoon, it burned in the basement of the house.
When the fire goes in, the flames are already running out of a window.
The use forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room completely burned out.
The whole planet was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spoke further.
The building will not be inhabited in the first place.
The exact cause for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest district has launched an offensive campaign to hire the pastor.
Background is a possible shortage of pharmacies: The evangelical Lutheran Church Hannover estimates that its number will now be half as far as 1,800 pastors and pastors by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in his talk with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to decide the work and day-to-day course itself.
With the bourgeoisie, the country church first commissioned a pastor on a full-time mission to urge young people to study theology.
At the same time, less and less young people decide to study theology after the apricot.
This leads to the process of decoupling: "Good voice is empty, the world is loud."
This has led to great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my term calendar, and I can put my priorities there where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a soul nurse.
They deserve as much as teachers and could live a good life.
There will certainly be more to be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have been a safe employer.
This is against young people today, who are not only about careers but about a meaningful work.
According to the country hierarchy, which comprises three quarters of the Netherlands, about 60 priests go to peace each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology studio began their Victoria.
In densely populated coastal areas such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to have positions in the future.
Burfien wants to organize, among other things, studies for young people and also invite prominent people who have studied theology.
The Theology studio offers a wide range of training.
You can even be President of the Federal Republic.
Country Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are running seats and six-point doors, as well as a free-screen facility.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with the care of Bowler-Working mechanics and logistics support to vehicle installation between events.
Drew Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced runners, but people who are looking for retirement and adventure as well as a way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format creates new opportunities to experience different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare novels on the straps and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun to develop the Defender Challenge cars – this will be a lasting mastership.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February with the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in Western Ireland and the Middle East.
Firefire called for the rescue of a cave, which is 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous fall in a stone bridge
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a space walker in the stone bridge in her misbehavior position.
Firemen fled on foot and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire-fighting took place to bring a hole in safety, which was placed on a 15-metre high front in a field wall.
The nine months old cockerspanel-Hündin Ruby was born after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone three days before being rescued from a rock bridge on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who is the dog, came to the stone bridge Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and thank you for the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had doubled their search for lost Hündin and published assistance in social networks when they went through the stone bridge after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 in the middle of the night, he saw a spaced walker, who executed his dog, the stared Ruby on the 15th floor of the rock bridge.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station took place and settled down to rescue Rubys, then transported to a dogbox.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It is located in the middle of the Fellswand – 15 metres from the top and the ground.
She didn't move any muscle during her salvation – she was as pregnant.
But now she's fine.
She just made a couple of doggies.
That was a very unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a giant accident."
There was the possibility that she was severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the zoo to investigate, but it was not established except for creation and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “The rescue was a tremendous thing."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them in the arms again.
The animal family explained that if the creation had become too large and they had been united, it would probably have been cut off.
The firemen have read great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that they would fall down, but she remained up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger said he never noticed Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio player this week, the Pop Star said she worked as a background singer at Jaggers Song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altroker at night, and that “he had taken me back when I was 18. ”
She added: “This is a long time ago, and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he “categoally admitted that he had taken an approach test with Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she has replaced him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest trip this year at the Rolling Stones Tour.

George Kerevan: European Deployment Gives the Shots the Choice
A new day, a new story about independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the record for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a secure border along the Hadrian wall with steel wire.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but it did not, as expected, play a role in the fates.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often enforce their strict rules if it is cheaper for them.
Since Scotland does not now belong to the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small consensus on what you really want from the shadow.
So, actually, no story.
And one who has come so far in the years that it is already a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passive control" end at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European fair?
Why does the London Yoch fight against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the European Union after the war has been put in stock.
With the euro crisis, the project has officially died.
In the EU, parties to land which are EU-enhancing or would like to launch the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to draw up almost five million votes in the Federal Day elections in September and thus effectively expel free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis appears to be a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy of Berlin and the European Central Bank, in connection with the commitment of the national economy, which is used by the holding of the common currency, many people feel that Europe’s project has been too far away.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budgetary deficits – it was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members at exchange rates which are beneficial to German exporters – and the German politicians would like to be allowed to do so.
Without the possibility of reassessment of the local currency, South Europe will again find itself with a built-in productivity evening against Germany.
The only possibility is to reduce wages and public expenditure – organised by Berlin.
With the current state and currency problems, there is a deeper issue of European productivity.
As a result of the "green" energy policies of Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry is compared to the United States of America with the doubles for electricity and the four-phase for gas.
This is an ongoing cost-sharing segment, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's financial statements do not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being forced into the corner by cheap American ski ferries.
As a result, there is a revolution, especially in France, the sole EU leader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was held in Schach and Paris was able to raise its eyes with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has stressed its own economic policy to fight the French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, the EU enemy Front National, has just won a decisive election and thus has directed the ruling Socialists to three places.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the voters' votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can't afford it, a column in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her new popularity among the white French working class?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to shake an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and this is very possible – then the European Parliament could first dominate such a block.
This is the point I want to point out: In the near future, the growing resensitivity against the EU and the common currency will be brought together to end the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the 'Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations', which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite companies may remain on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain will distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific is close to the fact that Britain will be in the Atlantic alone.
Where's Scotland staying with all of it?
We can decide to be a region of (last consecutively) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which is also part of telling Berlin and Brussels where they can hide.
I am convinced that Scotland could go well in a closer European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar countries is easier in a non-pained Europe of the nations.
On the other hand, we should consider maintaining Norway's balance and our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, of course, the most successful political movement against the Spartan policy in Europe, and in 2011 has gained a more spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and proposed) cuts that the Labour Minister Alistair Darling and the next Tory-Lib Dem coalition have been responsible for.
It would be easy for Scotland to decide now for independence only in order to obtain a savings policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Faster Growth
Afro-American and Spanish girls tend to achieve puberty more than their white age gender, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean immediate puberty
There is no order that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemitic fattyness is an excretion of early Pubertet
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter has grown up in the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrineologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time with parents to relax – normally it is not a sign that the Pubertet is coming in soon," Kaplowitz explained.
Public displays of development, such as growing breasts, shampoos and axelhaares, as well as body tissue, appear earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight discontinuation of the age of menarche in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it still lasts for at least two to three years until menarche," said Caplowitz, also the author of the book "Pure Pubertättt in Girls: The essential consultant to deal with this problem often."
Time is the best test of how the Pubertet progresses.
It is contrary to what actually represents the beginning of the Pubertetet, but it is true that the growth of breast-feeding is accompanied by an age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or slows down – something that a child can monitor exactly.
Tests could be shown by an endikronologist for faster progress, so that serious problems such as tumors or systs can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and a different consequence: early ageing of the bones, which can lead to optimal growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a medicinal or hormonal therapy focus on the age of the child, the development rate, growth rate and the emotional range.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is reticent about medications, but he adds: “The pressure of puberty can ease the behavior and feelings of girls, other than their parents. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young daughters to have periods.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they maintain the hygiene side," said Kalopowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter received her ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about Menstrration, she was not emotionally prepared.
She got pregnant and left school at home because she was the first in her boyfriend's career.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no definitive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be harmful.
Young people come to the Pubertet.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convincing premium is the epidemic of fattyness.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls from six to nine years of age who developed a relationship between body fat and enter the Pubertet.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Spanish girls tend to achieve puberty more than their white parents.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be an early puberty of all possible things, from economic conditions over the climate to the genes.
Another suggestion: Although boys are already growing face and face-to-face savings, the trend towards a full-time early puberty is not as pronounced in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of Akne and Shamhaar is spread even among babies and children.
"We must be careful how we identify the real beginning of the Pubertet," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedagogical endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to let their child know how to speak with his or her child.
"This can mean that you have to talk before you're expected," says Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who wake up early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes into the mind before.
Jumbo manufacturers fight for large orders about seat width
Among leading air carriers, there has been an exchange of views about the extent of the number of seats in the tourist class at long-range flights, which indicates the tone for a bit more complex on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The struggle revolves around the length of the long flight journeys offered in the tourist class – not always those who try most of the airlines, but this designated space sets the key to efficiency considerations in the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. Dar.
Airbus asked this week for a industry standard, which prescribes a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Ezrival Boeing said that the airlines should decide.
As a result, air carriers will be able to sell even greater versions of their two-motor long-range flights, and are expected to hold records from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results to deliver the new "mini-jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that his modernized "777X" ranks 406 people in the tourist class who are over 17 dollars and allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transporting 350 people in 18 customs is widely located in the tourist class, where there is nine per row.
Aeroplanes often share lifts about technical details by advertising in the press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders are expected to run, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented a message that could be the start of a new show-up war and showed moneyholders a picture in which three people sat together in a restaurant, and the title was “Would you accept it?”
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in situ, which are worse than regional turbo props," says Airbus CEO John Leahy.
In view of changed eating habits, people become thicker, but aircraft owners have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the average American man has increased by 10 per cent between 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the US Ministry of Health.
In the 21st century, the figure of the average American male population is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival stayed on a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body weight of the freshly cut Jet set was smaller.
One conducted studies such as Airbus, which indicated that an additional load (2,54 cm) per seat increased by 53 per cent sleep quality.
Boeing stresses the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not in the manufacturer's mind to decide how airlines have created the balance between fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the size of the seat.
“It really goes beyond giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they need to do in order to be successful,” explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them beneficial.
They know her business better than anyone else.
There is more freedom for passengers, but for manufacturers, there will be an increasingly important issue that can affect the environment.
A run for flight orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars in order to cover listed prices in the coming decades could be sustainable in the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seating is the driving force behind the construction of the new Jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 per cent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor long-distance sign as the market leader in this segment, the 365-situated Boeing 77-300ER.
The statement of Boeings to the results is partly based on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still smaller than the machines currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore looking for more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose for the worse arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper flights.
"Ten customs would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from a economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin installation, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-wide Jet sellers even take band measures to monitor the installation in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-quality design for ticket flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-six rows, but it has not yet sold its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered broad seats to the gangs for some Jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of a great modern Jet, experts say that the call would probably be delayed after a new industry standard, but could be excluded from the well of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotiin vaccines could make the joy of smoking the garage
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotiin vaccine that could damage the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse for a long life in the presence of nicotine.
Prior to tests on humans, further tests will be needed, which can last for a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of Imfping Strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but they have to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials, nicotinic mice were kept at their normal level of activity.
However, without interference, museums had taken a “outtime”, the researchers declared a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the Scientific Translational Medicine section.
Early tobacco was missing because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain the anti-corrosion needle, the administrations had to be given so often that they were expensive and ineffective.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be used for people if he is absolutely sure that children will be taken before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“Then they know that if they start smoking again, they will not have any more fun because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them quit their habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi tends to be influenced by Obaid
In contrast to former Labour Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a statement is made by the State view of corruption.
The former NSW Minister wishes to have amended the provisions for maritime packaging at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, who has covered three main points in a state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations into whether both of them had an impact on the various ministers of the State concerned, the Contracting Agreements in Circular Quay, where both restaurants and a coffee were operating, without any explanation after their departure in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi has been aware of the interest hidden from both of them on the grounds after Tripodis, former deputy chief Lynne Ashpole on Thursday, had said the same thing.
In the 2005 annual talks, the government had pressed public statements for the pacts.
The parties were against it and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the contract contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which contributed $2.5 million annually, were extended without a public statement.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Interior from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public statements.
However, he insisted that the changes be made to the prayers of Obed, who, like Tripodi, had forced the government to reorganise the peace arrangements.
A telephone letter submitted by the ICC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obaid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who had been transferred to the Ministry of the Sea after working under Okaid in the Fisheries Authority.
“When the topic discussed in these telephone conversations is the development of commercial contractual arrangements?” asked Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," replied the Tripodi.
I can't remember what was said, but it was definitely not.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli combat vehicles reach the target in Syria, such official sources
Israeli hunting weapons had reached a target in the Syrian port of Latakia in Thursday, confirming a leading government worker against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, it was intended for Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air raids on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas may be subject to "real test"
The Government is considering further measures on a 'real test' for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it should be based on a criterion to prevent the 457 use of unqualified jobs or as a centre for the addition of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a discussion proposal was published by the Government after the former members of the Labour Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the Government's comments to foreign workers because they could be viewed as a guide by the neighbouring Australians.
"Superious declarations such as 'foreigners should stand back' and 'Australian first' are a very unpleasant return in times where trade unions called for a protected labour market," she told the Australian Institute of India today.
Historically, it was considered that white labour forces should be protected – and if some in the region took a echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The debate proposal covers twelve measures, which were first proposed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister for Migration Brendan O'Connor, who refused to talk about human rights in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the proposed changes that are still being raised.
If the ‘real criterion’ is taken into account, a person requesting a visa may be thoroughly checked whether ‘the application is true in the cases in which the applicant is connected with the holder or a relevant person of the subsidiary’.
In addition, companies could also be obliged to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, after having established hundreds of companies in the past that wanted to support only a small number of workers at first.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan Asylant died on a heart attack after arriving this week with a flight boat on the Christmas Eve.
The broken nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him was cared for by an adult cousin who had also been on the boat since his father's death in the middle of the night.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed links between Scotland and northern England by the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Barones Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After the end of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed roads between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion dollars to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which is in talks with transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further track capacity and travel time improvements for Norway and Scotland.
This is the possibility of a trip of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Barones Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We go forward with HS2 because it brings great benefits.
Without it, we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
In the name of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for the use of "indisputable" for the Scottish connection to the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link generates the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, the Scottish economic force also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the United Kingdom."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and examine the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, the benefits of all creation and the connection of Glasgow-Edinburg, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British ministers next year and decide the next steps together.
Provisions on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in Australia for a period of time in force
Australian flight passengers also have to stop tablets and smartphones at startup and landing, despite efforts in the United States to lock the arrangements for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their priorities so that passengers can read, see or play videos on their devices during critical flight stages, if they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people are afraid that they can't read their e-books when starting and landing.
However, Australian companies have observed the decision to implement the United States flying companies to work, but no immediate plans have been taken to amend their rules.
The CASA Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical stages of flight in Australia still apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific provisions on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft", was launched.
The subject is subject to provisions which the following airlines maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by the cabin staff.
Virgin has already discussed with the CASA about an increase in use of its Wi-Fi maintenance systems on flights and explained whether it is open to changes, but it has to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would like to welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer now (free maintenance) during the flight," said one speaker.
It has been explained that the current rules will remain until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAO regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit, and we will certainly see the FAO decision as well as the reasons for it.
The decision varies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the malfunctions by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handpack programs and customer instruction.
"After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, they can pass the use of more portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and smartphones at any level," the FAA announced.
In rare cases of bad vision, the Crew will show the passengers while driving the devices off.
In addition, the group recommends that heavy equipment be safely concealed at start-up and landing under the seat or in the folds over the seats.
In front of the Revierderby vs. Schalke, accompanied by BVB trailers with lights for horse scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borisia Dortmund then announced his heart consequences.
Before the game of the football Bundeslage against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras first responded with a Sweigen.
It was an unusual, almost splendour acoustic, which was held by the observer until shortly before the German vice-mier Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
The guests were too tired to hear with their dreams.
The southern tribunes, where the most trusted of the faithful - and the deaf - are the BVB fans, initially presented themselves with extraordinary relief: no dreams, no beatings.
The Podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint attack, remains unscathed.
And in front of the tribune, a large band with the title "Section Stadium ban".
Only as a torhüter Roman Weidenfaller as always as the first BVB player to play the place burned short-lived Jubel up.
As his men's colleagues followed, there was loud and silent voices - but no longer everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune, nothing happened.
Also that the stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once told the positive experiences of the last day - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not worry about holidays.
Just five minutes before the attack, the Capo's podest - and the hand-cracked thrust of his hands, came out in a slow crack, as Dickel, as usual, asked the voice on the knees at the stadium.
The last time the south tribune was always on the line - and finally here was the most popular place in the stadium.
And at the latest, as with the South Tyrbonne's appeal, the strong demand for "Debyssier stands up," was again all the time.
The Sweaing was probably a reaction to the events of the past day.
Right in front of Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the cosy BVB trailers had fired at the entrances and on the site - and had almost torhüter Roman Weidenfaller.
The game was later hit because of the Chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the peaks of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and it is believed that Watzke's words were a more unforgettable term for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultrasound movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate action, Watzke presented Ultras with a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"That's what I've forbidden," he explained.
The zero tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnics cannot be imposed.
In addition, the ultrasounds were shown different possibilities of punishment - until the service day they have time to decide for themselves.
Otherwise, such a ban will be imposed by the BVB until the end of the coming week.
"It's going to be exciting," said the security guard.
You may be excited about how the reactions to the South Tyrol then occur.
Pfandhauser trees in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the Middle East
Janani Amirthalinga, in a Pfandhaus in the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, presents a golden ramreif, a ring and a couple of horns to pay the fees of her daughter.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, because my whole money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned $3,000 a month in Singapore (about € 1.730) as a administrative worker and her husband is also working, the monthly income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of South-East Asia – where the debt of the households is incurred – is so great that the valueMax, where she took her bag, this week became the third pandaus, which is placed on the Singapore branch.
Not only is it a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but it is almost as valuable as an insecure bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhauser in Singapore wants an effective 17 per cent annual rate, which is only about 15.4 per cent, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Pfandhauser offers the advantage that there is no need for a review of credit worth or income, which is why loans are faster than banks can afford.
For this reason, millions of people in the Pfandhauser region have been forced to use their families to reduce the pressure by increasing living costs and increasing budget and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a tight financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-income households are looking to compare the difference in the economy.
This week the rating agency referred to Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in respect of gross domestic product, as assessed by the Agency.
Malaysia has 80 per cent of GDP on top of the list, an increase of 60 per cent still in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which was recently released this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
"In the end effect, this means that in view of higher costs, people will be tried in the medium to lower segment (the income scale) to get their income wherever possible," says Song Song Wun, an economy at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic heights at the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend towards the introduction of personal objects, since people are using the opportunity to transform the beauty of the family into Bargeld.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the committed objects are in the 200 Pfanghausers of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get our Grandmother's gold chain back in the next month."
The largest Thai panda operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20-percent customer growth in its branches in the last months.
The growth in Pfanda business is so strong that the valueMax, the company operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, not only wants to expand in the nearby Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, manager of ValueMax.
The company finances it with 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the arrival in Singapore.
While some creditors had been thrown into a cross fire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pfandhausers not only added more valuable interest than other sellers, but also did not raise the debts directly.
"Clienting customers with objects they already own, and the liquid personal property does not increase the cost of budgeting," she explains.
The Pfandley business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure funding.
Nor are all people who use plenitudes in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to collect gold bars and Rolex watches for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"This includes beneficiaries who have recently set something up for a business or investment, or small companies that have to overcome obstacles to cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA protects data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service enthyler Edward Snowden has a primary interest in assisting Germany in the proclamation of the ever-increasing NSA ports.
Following the presentation of the Green Federation's representative Hans-Christian Strebele, it appeared at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, under which conditions would be considered by the former secret workers in a German government or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for tasman health
The Australian Government is faced with the strict conditions linked to the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for tasman health, in order to ensure that the Government of the Federal State can't spend money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "impossible measures" to address a crisis caused by an old population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasman Deputy Director Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut down a emergency correction package that deals with the unique challenges faced by the Federal State," Plibersek said today.
The 325 million-dollar package includes 31 million dollars for election services.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to a gray star, should eliminate withdrawals.
In addition, there is money for day-care clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better care for seasonal stays, vocational training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of the clinical staff concerned to me, they are the best possible way to improve the tasman health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister was responsible for a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Tasman Government.
The Federal Republic of Germany must maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where additional money has been spent.
A Tripartite Commission will be set up to ensure that health services are provided as efficiently and efficiently as possible by the Federal State.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the public tasman health system to a more sustainable course."
In spite of this, he commended the government for responding to its urgent assistance, which he first expressed against the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the Federals will make a great contribution to the public health system of the Federal State's welfare list," says Wilkie.
According to the Government of the Federal Republic, these elections will be widely implemented in the short term.
However, the political speaker of the opposition to the Federal Republic of Germany, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is only a “plaster solution”.
"We are in the situation today because the Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It cannot be that a government earns nearly half a billion dollars from the system and connects the Commonwealth 300 million and then does it as good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to ensure that no single dollar of the rescue package would be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niclaux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot is convinced by exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, it is also more difficult than necessary.
In France in the 1760 ’ s, the story of Suzanne, a young teenager who is sent by her family to the monastery, tells us what happened.
When she rebels, she is faced with the extreme gravity of an extremely sadistic opera and becomes the object of the erotic fascination of another.
The film never leads to loneliness or loss of sense – and it is a problem.
The celebration of the film, with which the film is told, also makes it a qualifier for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons production facilities and Gitt gas union, declared the global Monitoring Group for Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while it came to a very difficult meeting in the north of the country near one of the places where toxic substances must be stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war just three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline
1. November, which was set up by the Damaskus organization in Haag to destroy or "inoperable" all the devices for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all the machinery for the mixing of chemicals to gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this procedure, which is based on the first phase of the destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy existing weapons and equipment.
As a result, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including sanfgas and Nervegas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday, the experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as reported by the Syrian human rights observation station in Britain.
On Thursday, 120,296 people were killed by the most active group, which, through a network of activists in Syria, was followed by the number of deaths.
Of these there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, 29.954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18.678 were government friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 dissertated military soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels who have many connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observation panel said it had given losses on both sides on Thursday, but no details were available.
The wars undermine the risk posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its deadly weaponry is a race against the time in the midst of an increasing civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely working with the United Nations, the team is “assuming that all important production and mix/filling facilities mentioned by Syria have been seen and destroyed.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the inspections and visited 21 of the cities identified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC, which were both locations, explained that the Syrian declaration “was given ... and that existing elements of the chemical weapons programme were destroyed at other mentioned facilities which were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the hat before the loss and the courage you have shown to all in the performance of the most challenging mission carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation in a comment published by OPCW.
For the past three years, the main Sunni Muslim revolutions in this civil war have fought against Assad's government and its security forces, many of which belong to the Alawits, have been a defeat of the Schiitian Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Zorn on the judgment of the bomber of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who came to the bomb camp in Bali in 2002 reacted to the condemnation of the last of the defendants who were brought before the court, as Umar Patek should be permanently dismissed.
Patek, who had been one of the most sought-in-the-flight people, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the construction of explosive bodies for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was sentenced to mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were tortured.
In addition, a claim was made in a number of terrorist-related charges, which included a wave of explosive attacks against the churches in Indonesia in the year 2000.
The government had called for a life sentence, even if it was for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, was also referred to as a “Demolation Man” who could have applied for death penalty.
The decision has generated painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old volunteers Jane and Jenny in the destruction suffered by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
With trains fighting, she said Patek would have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow the footsteps of the other core.
"You should put him before a divorce order," Corteen said against AAP.
I have to live every day so I won't get any more singles and I'll never see my daughter again.
The Sari Club was equally on the ground when a violent bomb exploded at 23 hours after 12 October 2002 in a small camp that was parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide victim was allowed to explode an explosive-filled rucksack.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack, three times as he fell into a life-saving system.
Hughes said Patek had the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodshed and were arrested four years ago.
Indeed, this type should receive the death penalty in front of all others.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
20 years after he killed 202 people and killed many hundreds, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali Bomber, who stood before the court.
He withdrew almost a decade of his arrest, but finally in January 2011 he was attacked in the Pakistani city of Abbottbad, where U.S. military forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet the objective of re-establishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't make it," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown any sorrow for how much suffering he has added to others.
The judgment came before the tenth anniversary of the attack in this year, which will be held with memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be plenty of trains this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Airport guests can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not drive any telephone conversations)
Air traffic controllers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to and use movies from the distance to land, but do not telephone the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, regardless of the airline concerned, FAO staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines need to demonstrate to the FAO that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight personnel’ training manuals and the provisions for the implementation of the equipment according to the new rules.
The FAO stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that wanted to develop the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"In accordance with the plan, we could readily accept the increased use of electronic devices," the FAA said in a statement.
At the moment passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft is closed.
They can only start again if the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain has green light.
When entering the country flight, the passengers must restart and must not start again before the flight has been completed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft would be safe from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at startup, landing and on the role field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport vehicles and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at greater altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional airline association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely, and we work closely with the airlines in this regard, both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
We're really sorry to have to feel like an adapter on this subject.
However, Internet connections to survey, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data within three kilometres remain prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are required to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So there is still no “Words With Friends” like Scrabble’s online game, which actor Alec Baldwin 2011 played on his smartphone when he had to publicly leave a ticket from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the plane.
And more difficult devices such as laptops must also be understood, as there is a risk of damage if they fly through the cabin.
Telephone conversations during the flight also remain prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone conversations is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAO.
FAO may prohibit certain electronic devices from starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker, from the National Transportation Safety Board, security experts for national transport questions on CBS News, would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitters," Rosenker said.
A consulting committee of the industry, which was called by the FAO to investigate this topic in its lives, recommends that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAO has increased to block restrictions on use.
Critics like democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri present the view that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement, as the use of the devices has become current.
In some studies, the word of the device is forgotten or ignored by up to a third of the passengers.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by flying, following reports of disturbances by navigation and communication devices by passengers, which were then the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than former generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not make any electronic interferences.
Flights have been offering passengers for several years Wi-Fi when the altitude is reached.
The air carriers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally less functional than earlier generations.
For example, e-reader only gives minimal radiation if you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, transmission values are stronger.
To prevent the closure of the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers, Amazon.com counts.
In 2011 the company workers played a full passenger plane full of children e-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but they could not determine.
Members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger association National Association of Airlines Passengers said that he would be the view that the damage by the devices is true even if the risk is minimal.
Other Committee members said that only individual reports were given by pilots who spoke for the destruction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee, however, recommends that FAO allow pilots to arrange for the removal of the devices by passengers in the event of malfunctioning of instruments under bad visual conditions.
A group from the travel sector welcomed the changes and referred to them as a reasonable adjustment for passengers who would be equipped extensively with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAO recognises that a pleasant passenger experience does not constitute a threat to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rehabilitation of birds saved by the North Sea Bohrinsel air-conditioning service
An air-conditioning service on the coast of flying birds, which was created on a North Sea coast, was again released into nature.
The water raids were launched last month with a hijacker to Aberdeen, where it was attacked by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the Center, said: “This water cycle was probably a winter bird from northern Europe, which was maintained by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently the created bird was looking for access to the nest.
He added: “He could no longer fly anymore, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water was cool and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who want to change our relations with the EU in Britain for the sake of prosperity and work in Britain.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov asked over 1,000 led forces from the economy, which represented the UK sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey are many surprising.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow, while the EU's countries are staging.
They want new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be promoted by government side rather than to continue with the long and intense process of reforming the obscenity of EU institutions.
In view of their view, the majority of economic leaders of the view that control of these key competences should be restored to Westminster from the Charter Law to the Product Law.
The general dissuasiveness of the internal market was overcome by the fact that, according to the company's statement, the costs of the Brussels rules would be outweighed by the advantages of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 per cent of the major companies agreed to the most traditional ones in Europe.
Finally, and most likely to say this, our question by economic leaders was that a significant majority of Britain wants a course to change the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade.
This knowledge found at companies of all sizes and leading companies shows that the economy needs a "complete change" that brings the burden of trade back to Britain.
There is a lot about – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would result in 16% change in opinion in favour of the EU's stay in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this question shows that the British economy is behind its plan to negotiate new British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant breakdown of power relations from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary to a greater extent after the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the outcome of our survey shows, which means an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the application of rules in Brussels.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom named Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new Gasera
The beginning of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria was the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the president of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream should provide for more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between the gasprom and its pendants in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, concerns an increased risk of conventional routes, as is to be heard on official pages.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were 'permanent'.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to benefit from the entire project in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other countries are expected to begin on the planned route for the year.
The pipeline is based on an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres Earth gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way forward to Germany's real estate location.
The economic frameworks agree, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the beer-zeeding.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good environmental conditions in the country compared with the Europeans.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out on the 9th real estate day of the Börsen Zeitung.
As German companies have been looking for, show the view of the transaction volume, so Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it was 31% compared to the preceding year's average.
In Britain, the Plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobilieninvestments offer an attractive advantage," said Ulbrich.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA workers from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with sexual offences in relation to children before 2011 attacks against child welfare officer Jonathan Lord of Caringbah have been raised as the Royal Commission for Sexual Misuse of Children.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that "there has never been a case of sexual abuse of children in the organization".
Business leader Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography, and another where a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was convicted of abuse of children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant attorneys, that he was aware of the first case but did not know the second.
He noted that the opening statement of the YMCA against the Commission had also not been taken into account, "has given external verifications of YMCA, in which YMCA was recognised as the primary front for child safety".
Evidence before the Commission shows much more that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-hand assessment of four possible quality audits of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, suggested that the business leader had said “from my left” when he was appointed by Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety.
Lord was condemned at the beginning of the year because of sexual abuse in 12 boys during his two-year YMCA activity.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, it is clear from the fact that the YMCA had a cultural problem that the staff member had stopped to report to Lords losses in relation to the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed losses, including that Lord was alone with children, that they cared privately as babysitter, that they were sitting on his shirt, that they said he loved it, and that children were playing with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose predecessor Lord was and who had prayed for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child's manager, Jacqui Barnat, who was the leader of the YMCA Caringbah, was “very attractive and most of the time very uncomfortable”.
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees, why they would not have been able to replace their proposed notification.
Instead, he said, she had a lot more to do with Lord's power of judgment, why she had not told him.
He explained that he had informed the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the "Jonathan Lord's accident" was "not the report" by employees, and the board approved him.
Hare said that the decision to force the employees to sign secret obligations shortly after the charges had been filed was taken by YMCA’s business manager, Liam Whitley.
He said that in order to prevent the contamination of the evidence, what was "incompatibility" and evil was done.
The YMCA NSW, while Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, was not a safe organisation for children, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse of children, the Commission.
He explained that there had been "responsible problems" in setting up, checking, processing, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was suspended until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but it seems that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, 59-year-olds reported his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his return in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely refused to go beyond British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as messenger of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the London standard with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this is happening, so..."
When the Pferdeschu experts arrived in Scharen in Cardiff to reach the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard fight was taking place.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The boy who is not yet in the children's garden and just a few months ago took his first step, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee hit the locker through the three rounds and held the first price – leaving 30 adults behind.
The uninterrupted couple, both of them equally large, were invited to participate in the annual competition, which is organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he was in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his tentacles in a cool angle and led the two-year-old toffies through the ring.
Fenton was welcomed by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony, which is far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his behavior and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday and had been in love with Shetland-Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great deal of fun.”
They had to take part in the entire field of participation and went with Goldpokal and Rosette from the place.
It was the second time he had participated in a competition with Tofee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect neighbors in the Arena held him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the foot steps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been conducting for more than ten years.
Howells told me: "The whole audience was so electric and everyone burned it and burned it."
He loved sand the entire length of the Arena, and although he was so vengeful, he has read fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm trailers and has two hens to care for.
As he started, it won't last long until he's on the "Fourth of the Year" scene – and I'm sure he'll be well cut off.
One speaker of the annual Pferdeschu said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony. ”
Together they're a great team.
The jury assessed Fenton and Toffee then how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead.
They focused on good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet dress has contributed her part to that, which really fits perfectly.
Chinese time to "reform" after call
A Chinese newspaper that had requested the release of a reporter who was accused of difamation to be reformed, declared a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later announced in the television that he had taken over his pension money to cover reports about a state-owned company.
The new expression will now be subject to a "exclusive rectification", explained the regulatory authority.
The "recordification order" was obtained by the Government for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in GuangDong.
Preliminary findings showed that the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports on the listed company zoomllion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editing management of the New Express was not ordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that she had decided to "stop an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting license".
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been shown to propose a complete recast of the New Express and recommend that the relevant officials be informed of the New Express and to check the new Express's lead team immediately."
Chen had written several articles for the new express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlon.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two appeals for his release on the title page and left behind his journalism work.
But then Chen appeared in the state television and found that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoom million as well as the entire media industry and its ability to gain confidence in the public," he explained against the CCTV State news agency.
I've done it first because I've been out of money and noise.
I've made it clear that I've been wrong.
In connection with Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title and explained that it failed to verify the reports correctly.
Various well-known suspects have recently turned off in television.
Experts say that circumstances are still routinely forced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned, to force someone to blame himself.
Drug tunnels with their own railways between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug exchange between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, lighting and electric railways, was now discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the tunnel measuring 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most missed passengers they've ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the circus pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects storage halls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are unhappily unlikely storage halls, which makes it easier to hide LKWs loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, the records of the court were secured at the back of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men, according to the statements of the authorities as drivers, were charged with possession and sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You have been sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, Schmugler sets on an extended underground network of deforestation channels.
The tunnel is the rear large pass that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana-Ernte in Central Mexico in October, which makes the drug cartels face the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a nearly 640 meters long pass with skis, which came from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Players Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Player Orlando Bloom has highlighted his wife's top model, Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be released on Friday (Order time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or expect."
When he and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support each other and love them as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, her son Flynn was born in 2011.
The Veganism is subject to vegetarianism according to Lexika, but differs in a very significant way from this.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of sawnets, eggs or a powerful edema, they are not on the food map of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the meat and fish diet, the Veganer can be removed from all consumption of animal products - also honey.
What remains to be done may be asked, but in the next consideration, the poor food environment is characterized by a significant incidence of malnutrition.
"Brotaupstrike are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of this reform house, who has a number of special products for Veganer.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the cargo in the domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand has lived in Vegan, in Lampertheim, he (fastly) finds out everything he needs for life. "In 1997 I placed my food and became a vegetarian."
About the century, then the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of food, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the artist leader normally suggests.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
In the first line, Vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, the Maxime of the Veganer, who deals with the whole consumer behavior.
Instead of relying on citizens, leaders or rubber bars, the Veganer has soon discovered completely new products, which increase the excitement.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually, vegan doesn't show up, it doesn't show up, but it's a range."The assumption that with the diet setup, reducing the choice of food options, Proctor goes back to the power of habit.
And that is exactly what these conditions allowed some to make such a good joint effort.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that leaves many up quickly, like smoking," says Proctor, adding a comparison.
And it is said: "A certain wild beast is not to be seen in the cattle."
At least it's the jewelry or the type of preparation that makes the taste taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings Aubergines, Champignons, and also a few Veganwürsts.
He looks forward to a balanced, varied diet where it should also taste delicious once again.
Of course you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage to food disorders, a further widespread adoption, has not been experienced.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin.
There are high-performance salads that only eat vegan.
"My blood values are best, I'll check often," said Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against vitamin B12 deficiency.
"When animals are eaten with food, instead of burning on the floor, it is asked whether in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 portion is high," says Proctor.
In addition, Veganer has the opportunity to take coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Prototor must not go far for food collection.
There are basic food products everywhere and every supermarket has a medium-term soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find a place.
I'm just going to buy something special.
"Many people think that the finished products are expensive, but that is how they are known for "normal" finished products."
In addition, the preparation of vegan dishes is much more expensive and less timely than accepted in the community.
"In the kitchen there's a lot to discover, with a few small holes you can do well if you don't get some better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, some more back powder and sugar instead of ei, with its vegan cheesecakes, Proctor was also able to bring his weed parents to the station.
The Veganer's family party provides a new ultimatum.
It's dynamic when you eat together, it's got a new position value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, however, he has also been subjected to skeps.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - When such questions have to be acted as a vegan with fingers touch.
"I don't blame people, I'm part of this society," Proctor didn't want to slow down.
And more specifically, the everyday world does not seem to be as vegan-like - and the Veganer does not seem to be as restricted as it is commonly accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's pommes everywhere!
"Many countries offer falafel, or even a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he weighs on pasta sites, or even orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of the habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even harder," the New Zealand country can discover a development: "I have to talk to the people to make them pay attention."
"If there's enough questions, they may be tired of getting the food map," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor adds the desire that other restaurants also have at least one vegan court on the food map.
On the basis of this, there are reasons for all of them.
Everyone can eat, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the contrary, fleshly desires are exclusive, and in the real sense of the word, because they close others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the biggest part of it impossible," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products may be somewhat difficult at first.
In particular, if you learn to understand what animal additives can also be contained in soils as colorizers, you seem to leave the mind quickly with the influence of ethics in so many hearts and cases.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Vaganissimo - animal substances and their alternatives" explain the many ingredients, but they are also supplied with food and cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to watch," says Proctor.
veganism, it is an important moral sign that is based on consciousness.
It may not be enough for him to stop his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The parent company Nasdaq OMX maintains its customers in Atem.
The trade on Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday in German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two Nasdaq OMXs, continued to maintain their business.
The most recent difference is that a whole series of smaller and larger panties continue with the baby operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indexes of Nasdaq due to errors in data transport were not calculated for an hour.
In August this year, it was given only two pounds a week.
First, the U.S. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent miscellaneous procurement issues to the option markets due to technical problems.
In addition, the boar operators needed almost a day to check and track the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock trade in the United States came due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq Tower for several hours.
In addition, in the past year, Facebook's birth had provided for appearances.
Nasdaq systems were not raised by the flow of procurement and sales contracts, later established the SEC survey and converted the company into a record profit of $10 million.
Constant: Radler runs 63-years around
The accident was reported by the police as a 26-year-old man at Donnerstagend, at 22 hours ago, with a train ride on the left side of the train station in the direction of the market.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly hits the ground on the wall, the driver said that the police could no longer break in on time.
At the next meeting, the footman was pressed against the wall of the house, went further to the ground, and a distance of about 15 inches [15 cm] went to the head.
A rescue team brought the victims to medical treatment in the clinic.
British police make Assange a delivery decision
The British police have today handed over a delivery order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian mission in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had a "requirement to make" which required him to appear in a police department, and added that he should not follow him, he was sentenced to arrest.
Assange claims the extradition to Sweden because of the complaint in a sexual case, after its possibilities have been issued according to British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its claim against the issue of the month.
Since he was afraid that Stockholm would be delivered to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian mission in London on June 19th and prayed for political asylum in South America.
Scotland Yard has "a 40-year-old man has been asked to put himself at a time chosen by us at a police station," one speaker explained.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the submission of the police claim.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States, and there he will be accused of possible spying, after having published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks web site.
The driver who was treated with 210 km/h and heavy drinking between the legs is paid £1,000 penalty
A car driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000 because he was in danger with up to 210 km/h and a drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was arrested on May 27, with his Mercedes Benz at A120 at Braintree.
After the police arrested him, they discovered the drinker between his legs.
Before the Court of Justice Colchester, Howie was known as guilty without the need for care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to payment of costs of 90 £ and 100 £ of offer.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London speculation blouse
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision by Schatzcanzler George Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, committed a stamp tax of 7% on housing, which costs over two million pounds and annual charges for buyers, housing as a company and not as a single person.
Already, revenue from the stamp tax for housing in the regions of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which totaled 708 million pounds in the tax year 2012/13, has been collected for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Nordic, the Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increase in the stamp tax on high-priority housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against an environment, it can be hard to assume that high-quality property could be low despite the effects of the old Community tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors restate, as regards the purchase of real estate in London, or the sale of property from it," he added.
First-class real estates – the top five to ten per cent of the housing market at prices – in the prosperous London South-Westgürtel, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have spread around the record value of 11.8 per cent in the last year.
The prices in Central London showed an equivalent annual growth of 5.6 %, but a growing "inland market" was exceeded, on which Saville's southern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog's jawbone and its voice.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs with the swans were more right-hand (from the look of the dog), while it was the left-hand side of nerve dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can make these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Valortigara, a neurologist at Trient University, said: “People are well aware that the left and right brain cells react differently to stimuli that generates positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brains are responsible for the movement of the left side, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side effects of their species, researchers monitor the animals while watching these movies of other dogs.
They measure the heart rate of the four legs and analyze the behaviour.
Maybe we'll soon understand why the shift once into one, when it moves into the other direction.
Professor Valortigara said: “We have shown the dog films with dogs – either a natural-made version or a silhouette to eliminate obvious other aspects, and thus we were able to control the movement of the snow on the left or on the right."
When the animals see how a strange unexpressed dog has moved the shift to the right (see from the perspective of the wild dog), they remain completely exhausted.
However, the swelling was usually after the left (again from the perspective of the dog, which is not broken), so their heart rate increased and they seemed uncomfortable.
According to Professor Valortigara, dogs do not communicate deliberately with each other through these movements.
He is more confident that the dogs have learned from experience what moves they should take care of and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs, and the link with weakness in a direction rather than friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners, animal owners and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol University of Animal Health, explained that this was not the first study to be examined whether it was important for dogs to be left and right.
Last year a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria, Canada, the following were: “Stop going to a robot dog, if it’s going to turn left and not right, rather to become uncomfortable – exactly different than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, therefore, the differences could lead to the fact that dogs in different studies did not interpret animals in movies or robotic dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there are significant positions for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs do not constitute exception,” says Bradshaw.
But since your behavior is easy to record, it may not last long until we understand why the shift sometimes moves into one, sometimes to the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys move event in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has moved an event in Glasgow after her lead singer has become ill with keel pendulum.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The announcement of the band came after she had already had to leave an event in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on her official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to reject the show in LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also reject the show in Hydro in Glasgov on Friday, November 1. ”
"In Alex Turner, a headache was diagnosed, so he can't appear anymore."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham is now located on 20 November, which was released on 21 November in the Hydro in Glasgow.
Keep all tickets for this show's validity.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconsistencies resulting from this.

Pope Francis mentions the first Cardinal in February
Pope Francis will first address new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican was known on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also those who choose a pope, so that Franciscus will be named the first group of men who will eventually be involved in the election of his followers.
There are currently 201 cardboards.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this is a group of 120 “chosen cardinals”.
In a statement that announced the message, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals will be held before the ceremony will be held for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to introduce the constitution in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be hungry until February.
He explained that a priest normally named as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals would be again 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he wished.
The composition in the next year is therefore important because it has been the first since the election of Franciscus in March of this year, so Valero.
At present, there is a certain overlap between Europe and Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope cardial will be called from the rest of the world to restore equality," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a winning number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed as a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find opportunities to reform the church since the formation of the Council of Cardinals.
In the past the pope chose everything by himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that if it is possible, that Franciscus would consult the Cardinals.
But before that, we were not in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called from large places to cardinals, but French went on to say “full surprises – so we don’t know who he names.”
GM calls new pickup tricks back in the United States to repair the seats
General Motors called almost 19,000 of his new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually ordered seating, so a communication from the U.S. vehicle safety control authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a failure in the mechanism for the return of the advance loan.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines on Vehicle Safety.
“If you are driving from the back of the vehicle, it is possible that the head protection is not properly protected, so that there is an increased risk of injury,” was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The repeated models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvent restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the vehicle in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letters due to the 16-day government Shutdowns, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra Tricks, which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, explained on Friday.
In October, GM 42.660 sold Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share increased at the New York Tower by 1.4 per cent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Double-declining depreciation [d]
I have elected President Obama twice in hopes of making a change possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been accompanied by the Republicans' blockade.
The blockade policy is not responsible for the problems of Obamacare website, the drug abuse
Obama's memories of the 2008 election battle were a sad reminder of what could have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm now reading a terrible sad book.
It is a book I believed in, it would raise me during the last two decades of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts the memory of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
If I'm finished with my patient's prescriptions tonight and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could breathe the breath.
The election was held to a earthquake and reporters in order to highlight the historical significance of this hour in front of the eyes.
My classmates were hungry for joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to the office in 2008, he had 82% approvals.
And then I closed the book.
Reacting on the front is a bad wake, as if you're getting rid of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a good memory, a sad failure to adjust.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has really changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and varied things Obama has achieved from the adoption of the casual Care Act for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the murder of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the political blockade strategy has purchased many attempts to advance our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name only a few.
However, after failing to defend Obama's government against colleagues and acquaintances, I have been brought to an end with my explanations.
I have reached a point of political uncertainty.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to hear foreign state officials leave or kill innocent children by drowning in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on American privacy and why Whistleblower is being punished, which exposes state misconduct.
It cannot be explained why Anwar al-Awlak, an American citizen of the United States, was murdered without proceedings, or why public funding and expenditure limits are being passed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which it means that the efforts of the White House to calm the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon Government”.
And, at least, it cannot be blamed for the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood with 18 that the government's work could be opposed to its previous political campaigns.
Clearly, the agency is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown Massor offer the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be widely chosen by the government itself.
And that's the most disturbing thing I've ever had.
I re-elect Obama because I wasn't interested in his candidate.
With Romney, there was a confusing and unexplained alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second working time for Obama, free from the pressure of future choices, would fill the hope we had heard so long ago.
However, with the reduction of the approval values for Obama below 45 % this week, the return in 2008 has been made by this book.
I look forward to seeing the many promises that have come up in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to hide a serious loss against Clinton at the options in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his staff that they had to come back to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our dentist again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest at parental leave
The billionaire and vice president Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are weaker and could therefore benefit from it.
The mountain construction agency, which is in a legal settlement about the payment of $6 million at CO2 level, raised the claim when he wanted to ask whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could check up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mountain taxes are thrown or cut.
However, Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and would benefit the victims of abortion personally from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when a child becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets permission," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission announced 53 votes in favour after the new issue was officially won by the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbotts daughter Frances and Bridget.
Whether the selection should follow the end of the selection
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you re-insign the data into a computer, choose immediately and then at 6:30 a.m. at night?
Palmer also criticized the use of blisters when marking the volume list.
Do you use it because you can sort out the results if they don't fall?
Today's vote with bleistes is incredible.
The Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously”.
At a public office, it goes to the public service.
"We do not want any reward other than history, that is, we can serve this Community at a critical time," he said.
RBS suspended two device handles
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its auditing department, two people who have confidence in the situation; this is another indication that the world's public awareness of the necessary manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world’s largest financial market to exchange the owners on the US$ 5.3 billion daily.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the extensive investigation, which is due to the scandal surrounding the Libor-Interbanking business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received information from authorities.
"Our findings on this subject go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
In the last month, the following persons reported that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and should be allowed between his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot Hand at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and U.S., was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of this dealer's behaviour was caused.
Bankers at Barclays and the Citi group were part of Usher’s Instant Message Group, saying the situation was close.
WU announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that she was investigating a necessary manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six world authorities – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with what bankers should have discussed with transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also submitted internal investigations or received information from authorities, who said that the situation was confidential.
Banks received instant messages and e-mails from several years to search for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has moved the dealers into an area in turmoil, which has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volume in currencies limited the chances of speculators.
Some bankers have tried to take off the business and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid retail market, but leading traders are the view that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in the retail trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their internal platforms by banks can lead to “a very low price of ticket to affect the market”.
The message came out on the same day as Credit Suisse was known, she announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchanged Fund Offices after he had suffered a loss of nearly six million dollars last year.
The Bank informed the competent authorities promptly and worked with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has dealt alone and that the matter is settled," said Credit Suisse.
Builds the building on the base of the puzzle
A group of the Bulgarian initiative "Swiezer Wies" has enjoyed the construction on the concrete floor at the curpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned up and spread the footway, which is in a press release.
The planned covering of the falling house in the back part of the building was not allowed for safety reasons, because the land was soon to be cut off.
Alfred Abel, who now manages the plot, had discussed the cleaning action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI action, a transparent with the message "We are for it" was introduced.
However, some 20 members of the citizens' initiative were less involved in their actions.
Your motto on the big plate was "We're against bulls."
In this way they wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruin on the Swiss side - the rice project should be cut off one day.
In the conversation with many passengers before the "Building" it was made clear that some citizens believed that it would be much better with the implementation of the city's projects, although there are not much the same questions about the size of the proposed project as the BI.
But they started to re-sign, because the city continues to increase these answers, that is, outside the BI.
As it was to be heard, the public statements of the mayor are also true.
May had said at the meeting that he feared the people of the town's decision to vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss side.
Some appear to be just confused about this, others feel like a "plump-pressure test" to the population, meaning that it goes on in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the aids.
Rangenick Shelter for Schiris: Manne no sword king
So satisfied Ralf Ranknick is also with the current high-ranking form of the Bundesliga Table Manager Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "Bullen" by the counsellors.
"There is now a dangerous tendency to pressure Mane and Alan into the category of slave kings," he took the two offensivvirblers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg, in protection.
The most recent event for Rankicks Critic was for man at 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday, when the Senegalese read a showcased to be held – which was free of charge, as the TV images showed.
"A serious mistake decision," said Rankick, the judge of Harkam as "completely challenged."
Harkam would also have contributed his part to the scaling between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German Landsmann defended him: "I would have treated myself the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself wants no contact with his colleagues after the swarming of his hat.
I didn't know why.
"Because I am the one who has been trained," stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success of the campaign, Rankick, however, agreed on a lobby.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he said.
There's not much to be done.
Above all, the way the man plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go this way.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transition.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"In addition to the desire of a player, he wants to leave the union," Ranknick said.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the government of Obama: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely related to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judge explained that the patient's sole mandate to protect and prevent the Care Act – it is mandatory for US citizens to conclude or to pay a medical insurance by 2014 – within the framework of the State's government's control authority.
The top judge, John Roberts, was on the side of the four liberal members of the chamber, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided to do so.
In addition, the Court confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and expressed the view that either the Federal States or the Federal States would have to extend access to medicine or at least all of the state medical facilities would not have been restrictive.
The complaint procedure against the law was extended by 26 federal states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 elections.
Norway: Norwegian place is made with rice mirror light
With heavy mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian Ortchen brought light into her quiet valley.
Because of the low sun’s fall, the Rijukan from Herbst to Spring usually falls in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors in 45 meters high, a century-long space became true in the middle of the week.
"At last!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some of the Tale inhabitants turned to sunglasses, others set safety-strengthening sunglasses.
So far, Sunhungrims had to ride in the winter with a sailboat on a nearby hill.
Ten years ago local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to link the arrows with mirrors in the valley.
But it has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city has finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about EUR 615 000) thine project.
A similar construction takes place several years ago in the Italian Alpenort Viganella winter sundry scene.
Posts aren't even for Sundays
"Many citizens have not yet noticed, the red points for the sun-duty are still on different letters from the city and the villages, but reading the little impression on the yellow containers of the Post AG, it is quickly found that the reading of sun and holiday days is no longer in place," the FDP shares.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only prior to the post building will be taught in the Ernst Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jakob Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it is taught in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in response to the FDP's request.
The social and youth political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to come here.
The Sunday service is just an important post service at the end of the day.
"This company, despite the price increase for letters in January 2013, is radically and irrefutable."
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' Group and Urban Association, supports his colleagues: "What bothers me is the fact that the times of education are changed in secret, or are also reduced."
The post is being removed from the city centre.
"At least the letter boxes in the towns must be re-learned in Neuschloß and Rosengarten on Sunday," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
In addition to the core city, not only mobile citizens had to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday service.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration would talk with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge also gives him a sunlight in Hofheim.
Your party has already spoken for privatizations.
"Then decisions were made elsewhere," said Mayer.
Frankfurter Park charges should be strongly increased
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more pleasant.
Today, the city's Magistrate tells about a presentation by Mr. Stefan Majer (Greece).
The park charges should be increased by 50 per cent.
However, the prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking and parking lots should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, then, the town council had to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Single Trade Committee holds this "for no good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "not too valuable for smaller dealers".
The German Transport Club is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "appropriate and actually excessive".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Friendly City: Quick operation Overrun Guests
With a small framework, the owners of the TSV Freuden city had to take part in the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swiss Alb.
However, the apples stood with an experienced man on the other side.
But soon it turned out that she, too old, could not fully cope with the rapid actions of the friendly citizens.
With the hard and positioned mounts, the rewards were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they ignored the steps and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Edward Schulz over the network and were not able to take place at the lockdown.
Two of the first high laws clearly highlighted the superiority of the peace cities in all their interests.
In view of this impressive and decisive performance, then the third sentence was obtained something light and smooth to 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much stronger enemy on the field on November 2 with the TV Biersbrunn, who was able to make it clear in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the two men from Baiersbrunn and Freuden City were present in the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbrunn.
They delivered a hard two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides was particularly due to errors and punctures, and also during the steps, the precision of double mangleware and in some critical scenes prevented the overcomers from looking for possible points.
In this usefully balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team agreed, but through the great physical use and a satisfactory commitment of both teams.
Day of birth at the small English hotel
In the mid-fifth day following the Natura 2000 projects on Hotzenwald, a group of engaged participants met at the small English hotel in Ibach.
As a result of allegations from the population that day should be cut off in the area of the look into the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many wanderers, such as Emperor, have named this area as the bright spot of the castle, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for beautiful appearances.
He thanked the delegates for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of duty would be an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukati from the Department of Natural Protection of the government Bureau of Freiburg in connection with the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the government and wanted a good deal of action.
The tourist goal of the wide view is to cover Tribulit with the objective of obtaining, among the highly advanced old public domains, its specific protected living space types by opening and connecting to the existing ways.
Certain species, such as rare skimmings and graffiti, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free links to maintenance.
Tribulait said she did not want to hesitate at this point to break a land for the planned biofuel area.
In this plan, the current measure is not only a matter of urgency.
A biospheric area also offers the opportunity to sustain economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and therefore a continuous addition to the life project and the previous generations' achievements for the future.
Following these different performances, Revier Leader Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the help in groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, the fortler was ready if necessary.
A group of assistants should take care of the release of wacholer books and the care of a dry stone wall.
The goal was the free view of the point of view.
Opening: Buyers Still Single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Bara city Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intacted infrastructure, a future school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own works as attractive city, has not yet reported a second citizen candidate.
As the only candidate for the follow-up of the candidate mayor, Norbert Bruger, who is no longer a candidate from age origin, is the 46-year-old bankaufmann and businesswoman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline runs on Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Nortel patents
On Thursday, the group, which had thousands of former Nortel patents, ordered a lawyer to file complaints about patent damage against telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was banned during Nortel’s insolvency extension.
Rockstar, the Consortium that bought the Nortel patents for 4.5 billion US dollars, charged Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent damages before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google will be affected in seven cases by patent damage.
The patents deal with technology that brings the search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising in line with the complaint that comes to the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC place phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, and last round is 4.4 billion US dollars.
After it was overrun by the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by Motorola's library to patents.
"Although Google has been broken by his attempt to acquire the complaints patents at the auction, Google has damaged the patents and continues to do so," he wrote.
Rockstar requires a high level of damage from Google, as it claims that Google's patent damage is obvious, so the charge.
Egypt represents the first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Mursi sets off the campaign, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political struggles in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promises a “new Egypt” when he was declared the first freely elected president of the country, and thus the successor of Husni Mubarak, who was expelled from the office 16 months earlier.
With the introduction of his office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth Head of State since the collapse of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He threw out the Eid before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robe, who had his seat on the Nile, and had an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the festival, which was transferred to the public television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer and member of the Muslim brotherhood in the United States, a fundamentalist group that has been adopted since its establishment 84 years ago as a banned organization by the government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were waiting for the building, when Mursi entered a small car.
Only a few hundred people had gathered before the court to join the new presidents, and in contrast to the presidial spring from the Mubarak time, the transport was held only for a short time so that the Autokonvoi could cross the normally inhabited roads that connect the city centre with the southern authorities.
As the uncharistic “Eszratzrad” of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has taken place since his victory and a free day in which he has not only as a candidate of the Muslims, but all of those who wanted to make the effort to oppose the authoritarian Mubarak since 2011.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," the Mursi, dressed in a blue ring with red tie, explained to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he ended the office.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to have his driveway.
He was officially welcomed by an army officer who played the national rhythms he belonged to in Habachtstation.
The military leader Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of audiences at the University's largest hearing with speakers from “The Army and the people are a hand”.
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as the base of secular education, has developed into an Islamic student group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi released a symbolic eide on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion that led to the end of the authoritarian kingdom of Mubaraks last year, and he agreed to return the presidial powers that had taken over the military court of the State of the Office.
However, with the absence of official immunity before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he is concerned with the military's will, which indicates that the struggle will continue.
Mursis talked on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist hospitality.
Falkenberger discotheque provides for two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On today's Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on the morning Saturday it goes on with a Ü 25-party.
Fat Beats and cool sounds are, of course, promised by the organizers on two days.
Workers scurried by leaders: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg was beaten by a leader and severely injured.
The man from Lamprecht House wanted to exchange a defective heating sensor at the outside of a guest house.
When he went up to the leader on the roof, he ran away and the man ran on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to the village hospital in Salzburg with the rescuer "Christophorus 6".
More violent in South Africa: two long-lived seas
Nine months after the brutal rape and rape of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the victim was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC sender.
The victim later died from severe injuries.
Johannes Kana was already found at the beginning of the week of the crime for guilt.
The action had been resolved on a country-wide basis.
The 21-year-old Annene Boysen was raped in February in an industrial country near the capital city of Bredasdorp.
14 hours the doctors fought for the life of the sacrifice, but remained.
The view of young people was so persuasive that the caregivers and sisters needed psychological support.
Kana had agreed during the process to be in a bar at night with Boys.
He also tried to have them beaten and raped, but he struggled to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police were initially excommunicated by several perpetrators, but two suspects left the port because the evidence against them did not suffice.
The government also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violence is almost daily in South Africa: There are about 64 000 reports of sexual violence each year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's relations in South Africa appreciate the dark figures of sexual violence at the 10th to 25th stage.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Schinken
Jumbo on the search for "the best shots of the world": For the TV message "Galileo" the Pro7 Star Bondorf visited.
The speaker points out at the same time: The most important thing for the snacks are the skiings, turbomast is not a good condition.
Can it be a quality product that you get in every supermarket?
Uli, the chief of the large snow factory in the Black Forest, explains how the company "Adler" works in Bondorf.
"Germany's most beloved Schinchen", as Jumbo announces the Black Whale Schinken.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the factory.
Jumbo also has to wash his hands first before he can touch the micro.
Jumbo used to strengthen fast-acting in Walshut
"I'm working a lot," said the TVmaker, Black Forest Schinken as a mass product.
16,000 Kielen per week speaks for themselves.
Weight, fat fraction, color: Uli explains why it comes to quality.
Most women are beaten with six months.
TV with level?
Also details such as the P-value of the flesh play a role.
You think the flesh is higher than the p-value.
"I'm tired of it when you find Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo Chinese.
Here the level of private appearance is presented in Reincultur.
But the visit is still worth it.
The viewer sees that the casting of the cables continues to work.
Because: Black forests are traditionally found without bones in the regular.
The secret of the gift is the sweetness with the salt.
Smoking and smoking recall Jumbo optically at a "U-boot".
The trick: toothbrushes are here in the smoke for the special taste of the black forest.
20 days in smoke make the snow almost black.
"Now the ship disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test release.
"It's really nice," said the TV star.
All participants will be allowed to live.
Did you think travel offices belong thanks to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has increased its profits for the entire year and is expected to receive recordings of holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now spends between 325 million and 340 million dollars on a refined annual basis, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means an increase of 12 to 17 per cent compared to the record gain of 290.4 million dollars in the 2011/12 period.
As business leader Graham Turner was known, Flight Centre won eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have benefited and some of them are in good way in the direction of record-years prior to interest and taxes," he explained.
This includes Australia and Britain, which are typical of our strongest results.
In Australia, in the second half of the year, the free-time industry has grown, which is equivalent to a slightly weaker market for business travel.
It was similar with the release of Flight Centre in the United Kingdom, while the customers also paid less.
The U.S. business won its first half-year weaker season compared to the season, so a profit for the third year will be expected for the entire year.
The shares of Flight Centre rise by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools will focus on mathematics, legislation and grammar
In English literature courses students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, Romantic Lyrics and contemporary British novels since 1914.
In the examination, there are also “unexplained texts” entry to reach wider readings.
The combined course from English literature and language will be completed.
From 2015 students have to set up their own language GCSE examination, where there is a strong incentive to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new teaching plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first stages that have been radically redesigned.
Other kernels will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the supervisory authority for tests, will introduce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less short-term work.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our test system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would be "more challenging, ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours a year.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, the comprehensive mathematical examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the skill in the range list – is likely to encourage schools to set more hours.
In the learning plan, more attention will be given to "relevant problems", including financial thematics.
Hiding beautiful animals and beautiful gardens

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ocumenical Forum
At the next Ecomenian Forum on Monday, 21 October, the new museum of the castle is on the theme "To hell with the Hell - Theological Reviews for today's treatment of the last things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Speech Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Council of Salem, the castle of Salem and the cultural center of the basement.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum of the question of how today people will discover the "last things" after death.
If people in the past century knew too much about it and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "the ones that are still our imaginations", then the contemporary prophetic teachings of the hopes for fulfillment are more pronounced by a certain possibility or even by language.
"The biggest hope is that Christians and Christians have been expelled from religion," says the referendum.
She has "supplyed us with so many questionnaires that we seem to have fallen out of the polls."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the fear of death."
In this way, the question is linked to that view, "the one that wishes to be good at the end of everything."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She promoted 1997 to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilition for Fundamental Theology and Ecomenische Theology followed the University of Westphalia in 2003.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been a teacher of systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Castle.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the small Heuberg confirm their faith in the firm
In two services of God, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the soul care unit were established at Little Heuberg.
The service of God accompanied the Laudato-Si group on the morning afternoon of the Youth Church The Spirit.
With the approval of the firm, the youth said yes to their baptism and received the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firm members had prepared themselves in the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the assistance of several members of the community on the great festival day.
In various projects, they learned various tasks of Christian life and shared experiences of the youth’s day in the underworld.
Illmensee: Second Mountainbike racers enthusiast
At the magnificent weather, 214 passengers arrived at Illmensee to deal with the course of the hives around the sea.
This is part of Ulrich Knobel from the Illmensee sports scene.
Among the participants, in particular at the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 metres, there were also a number of rowers who wanted to exercise their Hobby once in the competition atmosphere.
Two young drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treuble from Aach-Lenz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Masterships.
These two were able to stand out as expected from the field.
As in the past year, Felix Bader was able to save a small amount of time to the goal and defend his title as a winner of the short distance.
On site two could re-place Pascal Treubel.
At the ladies theresa Duelli was from the Albtraum team, which created it all up on victory points.
In place two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Oweningen.
A satisfactory development is the growing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only with regard to performance, the whole band size was represented by athletes.
The age structure also prevailed from 10 years in the youth to more than 70 years in the oldest starters.
At the main stage, there were even more absolute top-levels at the start of this year.
Four drivers were able to get away from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-proffect of the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl was with a team colleague already twice a world champion in 12 hours.
In this year he became a master of Europe in this special discipline.
In addition, Roland Ballerstadt, who has already named his own two German master title in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 altitudes, it reached a Wipernschlag final in front of the three-sea Hall.
Pangerl found himself first over the target.
Only one second below could the Routinier Ballerstadt secure the second place in the overall value.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third of the overall value.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main line.
The second place protected Area Blersch from binswags before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and assistants showed themselves very satisfied with the unplanned and well-organised performance of the event.
Routes by slamming, fluids and dschungel for free medical care
Dr. Georges Belle brings free medical help in delicate villages in Cameroon
Belle and his team spend almost every week to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Log out here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Belle belongs to top 10 of the "CN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in top 10 to select him as “CN Hero of the Year”.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
21 years ago Georges Belle saw how his sick father lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
James Belle was wounded in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then he formed a disintegration that spread to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurochirgen in Cameroon," said Georges Bülle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bille spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Belle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but it's not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since Tälles Father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, such as the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there is a doctor for them, most cameras may not be able to visit.
Two out of five people live in the country under the poverty line and nearly a quarter of the health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Belle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered to see in Belle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Belle and his volunteer team have conducted 700 free operations in the last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a prison surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he established a joint organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas for weeks and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people in small buses and ride with the broken medical equipment on the roof over unencumbered ground into the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received as heroes: a festival, a song and dance and the best presentation to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate and dance – with its wide layers and its unlimited energy – is a happy occasion.
The next morning, the team will then start with a survey of hundreds of patients.
“For driving we treat 500 people”, said Bülle.
They come from an area of 60 kilometers around the village – and it is on foot.
Each of these weekly clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive cramps, spread glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations with local operation.
The operations usually take place in a school, a hall or a apartment; after the intervention the patients are up and go to the reception area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment will be stored by the group's generator and will work so well with the toilets and its volunteers until early mornings on Sunday.
It is an intense thought, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They wake up all night, so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Belle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations in the last year and knows that it affects the people it helps with its work.
One man explained that the free operation of a service bridge that he received now enabled him to work again.
"That changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to weekly clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bille also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his joint venture, so toll; the rest comes from private funds.
"I don't really know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who studied at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine and volunteerly worked in the Belles Group.
He is always in the hospital or trying to spend money on the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and healthcare professionals like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Belle, this is an opportunity to collect practical experiences that they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations where we help, shed blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Belle," says O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their travel to Cameroon themselves and often bring spread health material with them.
But if they're in Yaoundé once, Bille takes over the supply, transport and guidance.
"He's certainly a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Belle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to lead a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he has made to his Father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Belle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to bring people back to sleep and to relieve the pain.

The battle is extremely intense
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", has been cut off by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old haze in his metal, play art.
The old man Santiago can't do anything in fishing.
That's how the two of them seem to be great.
You're sure to be able to see the fall in the neck of the old man who talks to the fishing boy Manolo.
If Santiago's tired of living on the table, that's true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson greatly enhances.
Hemingway told the story of a warrior, a courageous man who did not give up and finally won the fight against the fish by his knowledge and his will.
Janson is in a wide range as the sole manufacturer on the stage.
He created it to focus on the public's attention, so his monologues are not a moment longer.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so true that the visitors forget that the sea is only made of blue-lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act on the boat before the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he takes the active scene into light: the hills of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which ensues the sense of life of Cuba with her songs and great voices.
The four musicians play Cubas Rhythmus and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Rise to Rome
At about 120 meters long, a water channel from the time of the Romans is provided below the hill.
Those who visit Cologne don't go to court.
About 157 meters lay both doors in the sky and make it the second largest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who attend the two philanthropic churches do not know that there is a lot to discover under the court.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Kölner Underworld.
Meeting point for his leadership is the service centre of Koln-Tourism directly at the court.
The round starts completely unexpected: "We're trapped in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the seventh years, the city’s father wanted to be an independent city, and therefore the rest of the old city walls remained the only thing that was not too big.
This is why most users of the parking lot are also passing through the Romans and leaving their car alone.
But who is more aware, in Parkdeck D2, discovers an archeological foundation based on metal-ring steel.
There are about five meters high ruins of handmade stone.
"There are the remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze allows the participants on the upper parking lot to turn a look into a window, 15 meters deep.
This is the source of the old house, which is unfortunately not to be taken.
The next station of the round is the Prefector, and here the participants rise again into the depth.
Here we experience the office of the first powerful man north of the Alps, the president of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation is for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippins, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor".
And at the Pretoria it is about the former state court, the power centre of the Roman Empire at Rhein.
From the front of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman water channel, which has been reached around 120 metres long.
"You can quietly take a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze encouraged the guests.
A surprise still has debts.
After holding the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, busy boat.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built her bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the bottom of the Mikwe, their origins have returned to the last century, different water conditions are acceptable by changing feet of the river.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the railway site for which the construction work should begin soon.
However, a few years will pass before completion.
Nearly broken leg: New surface of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in Rockermilieu will be reassembled after more than four years.
A process has begun because of attempted death, dangerous physical damage and damage against two 30-year-olds before the Frankfurt Court of Justice (Oder).
He will be accompanied by strict security provisions.
The defendants are trying to arrest him.
They should have been active in the rocker scene and then heard about the bandidos.
In June 2009, the government asked them to put three men in a car and put them in a car together with unknown complexes in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely beaten, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims should have heard of the competitive grouping of Hells Angels.
One should be a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Previously, it seemed that there was a persecution campaign with several cars.
According to a complaint, it was about revier fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two accused were released in a first procedure in early 2012.
At the time, a judge said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloodshed.
The perpetrators had carried masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice reviewed the Court of Justice and referred it back to the Court of Justice.
One of the accused is now due to another crime in the open suit.
In particular, it was about the reconstruction of the operations at night.
As a witness, the Commissioner who was present at that time was charged.
In the center were telephone conversations between the accused and other persons who had heard the police.
It is difficult to keep Rocker before the court almost always on a previous law for them - and do not say anything about it.
That's also true of the victim.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packed.
The government lawyer Stefan Golfier from Frankfurt State Administration (Oder) said on demand that there have been new traces since the last procedure.
For the process, eleven further negotiations are proposed.
The company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the books of the people on the beach and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, it may be responsible for one or more cocktails or juices!
What's more important than driving to the next drive-in to put down a little bit?
I'd like to talk about it when it's going to the fast food halls late in the morning.
A couple of pumps, a cola, a bourgeois - and then nothing like home and bed!
But the obvious difference between me and other hungry disco prisoners is noticeable on the wall.
Because what has to be missing that one will get out of the car window with constant regularity?!
In particular, the weekend is on street borders and on parking lots.
"Wieso?" I ask myself.
Are the people to be baptized to take the children with home to the next mill?
It's not just that the paper product breaks the landscape.
Tütens have already covered transport facilities such as guide planes and thus solved accidents.
In this way, it does not seem to know what this word really means.
If you're on your way by night, just right with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look after crowded nights: clamots, bottles and other furniture.
There would be a few more or less holes - unlike the road where no one wants to jump on the rest of the other.
I can see that the day will come when the cities and communities will be in the blue - and the fast food chains will have to demand for their little feet.
Obama's return to health policy
Following his severe criticism, President Obama repeated his frequent, clear promises yesterday: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their policy-makers received a letter of resignation, the Republicans suggested to the President in the last days that he had drowned the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The overwhelming majority of citizens who have a functional health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the many media reports on the protests, Obama asked those Americans who received such messages to look at the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better, comprehensive health insurance at the same price or price as forecasted.
"They come with a better offer," he said.
The government pointed out that it was little surprising that the five percent of the people who had concluded an insurance would have to look at another price, since their contract did not conform to the new standards under the Model Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans exactly: you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the representative's House in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Acts, stated that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I am also frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to win your trust back.
This statement was made by a member of Sebelius who was behind her sitting in the hearing in the representative's house after a conflict with the Republican representative Billy Long from Missouri. This was because she was obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius resumed with the question why the “architectin” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily threaten a State-enforced insurance to close a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
The Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attacks on the Syrian Air Force Base
A U.S. government officer who wanted to remain anonymous, on Thursday, accused the US newsman CNN, of Israeli warplanes had arrived one day before an Air Force Base in the Syrian Latakia.
The aim was to be "records and related equipment" by which the Israeli government feared that they were determined for the Lebanese Hesbollah, it was called CNN.
The Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab Ambassador Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia had been seized on Thursday night, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where Russian respirators of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rockets were to be seen, followed by channel 2 with a range of 35 kilometres and can transport pumps up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The Government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters also quotes an anonymous Israeli government officer with the words he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but it is not safe.
A speaker of the Israeli Defence Ministry said anyway: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yisha stressed in the journal Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver land air rockets to the Hisbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant that the passage of a "red line" would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an inexhaustible opinion that US spying has been “inexhaustible to go far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected opinion, pointed to an increase in the US's contrasting attitude toward its monitoring programmes, saying that the spying was “inexhaustible to go too far in certain cases”.
In addition, the Foreign Minister, together with Barack Obama, stressed the responsibility for having taken action on "Autopilot" when the explosive attacks by the Wistblower Edward Snowden were published on the NSA's spy activities.
By means of the information provided, the U.S. government has become a diplomatic source of the release from its allies.
At a video link to the open government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have been done almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to survive is still at the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on 11 September.”
As a former high-ranking member of the U.S. government, he concluded that the US spy had exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights had been misused.
He said: "In some cases, this is too far-reaching."
The President has decided to create clarity, and therefore leads to a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is a misuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
Kerry, however, was convinced that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its monitoring operations.
He added: “We have to do it with a new world in which people are willing to talk to themselves in the air."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is worse than killing people, spreading into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to take it off and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we have prevented air raids, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans.
In addition, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to raise concerns about the alleged American spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US during the anti-terror attacks, as explained by the President of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had talked this week with representatives of the European Parliament and others and was concerned about their pressures to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain on board in view of our common efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is sitting in the Senate for the first time and serving as chairman of the Senate Committee on External Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concerns about the NSA programmes.
Media reports on which the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have charged relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were inadequate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO associations and exchanged with the United States.
Other enthusiasts quoted documents from Snowden that the NSA had monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other state buyers worldwide.
The leader of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the spying with allies as necessary and explained that it was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy, his authority, prepared the trip to the convention to be held this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and Chambers.
The names of the other Members involved should be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route will still be worked out.
While stressing that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, Murphy also said that there would be some "first words" to be given.
He said that the European governments had to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they themselves had been using for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect European rights, they must also be found to be the fact that we are not the only ones to spy on," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a journey to the Middle East and to Poland on the weekend to take advantage of the United States strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A heart attack on the spring line prevented the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga outdoor game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is used by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the man.
So far, he could only do it individually.
"We will soon decide on its use," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have the best to protect him with six hits.
Because the mains must already be on the lost performance forces Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australia's against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15-day prison in Phuket because she had been falsely accused of being raped by a taxi driver, was sentenced to trial and released on bail.
At first, Stevie Rochelle Bamford was found by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, to have made a false accusation, after she had given her testimony to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the mornings on the Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the recording of a video camera showed that she had definitely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket held Bamford for two days until she was able to imagine the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a port facility with low security levels at the Phukets border, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for her daughter.
Tunks explained against the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to return to Australia.
"We naturally worry, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has filed against the Court of Appeal and is against a charge of 50,000 baht on free foot.
In Australian reports, she was to read that during the summer of the holiday in Krabi in South Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford would be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the profession could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of Mrs. Michelle Smith in Phuket, might be trying to improve its associated tourist image, and that is why it comes to a call for release.
