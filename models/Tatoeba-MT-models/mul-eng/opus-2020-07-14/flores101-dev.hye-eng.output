To get back to their former energy level, they have to get rid of the extra energy they've got from the light.
They do this by removing the smallest part of the light called photo.
Scientists call this process a "dark out" because atoms are absorbed by the light by the light on the outside of the photo, and light is a form of radiation.
The next picture shows how atoms are generating photons. Of course, photons are much smaller than the image.
Photos are even smaller than the substance from which the atom is made.

By the end of the war for France, Germany was ready to enter the British island.
The German attacker put the U.S. Navy cover, and the British army had lost most of the heavy weapons and custody when it was captured from Dahan, so the army was too weak.

The complexity of the highlighted objects is that the complexity of the focus lengths and the number of objects is much larger than the constant distance of the focus.
