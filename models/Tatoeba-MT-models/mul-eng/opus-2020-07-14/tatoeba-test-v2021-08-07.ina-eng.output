You son of a bitch!
You're talking about brother, aren't you?
You're talking to my brother, aren't you?
You speak very slowly.
You speak very slowly.
You still love her, don't you?
You can.
You stole my ring.
You stole my ring.
You're born like a fish.
The youth is always right. He is careful to follow the advice of young people.
You have taken the wrong key.
You must get another key.
You used to raise canaries.
You've led them by the nose.
You have a visitor.
You have a little color on your nose.
You've missed me.
You've blinded me.
Do you prefer the coffee?
You've always been in my mind.
You've always been in my mind.
You were good, now you're better.
You found friends here.
You're used to being stuck here.
You won't be disappointed if you read all the books.
You wouldn't be able to say.
Zero's in front of one.
