What's going to happen? CSSD did not know Voldemort or platistry in Prague.
The new CSSD elections at the capital's headquarters will obviously have to overcome a real language barrier to understand the municipal council's level with its former and new ODS colleagues.
The Current Day.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely if they know the Argot that was born during the last few years at the fair, when they were partners of the current coalition who were leading Prague.
The vocalist pointed out that Prague's political cremation ran during the previous evening of the mayor Paul Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the Metropolis.
It is surprising that it has been discovered that the new elections do not fully understand the known terms.
At least they tell him.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I am a young man in Prague's politics who responded to Lukas Kaucky, the voice of culture in the "parrain" vocabulary test.
And with regard to the political vector, the island Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf trust".
"It's the only expression you suggest I use."
Sinon, I don't use Argot.
From the vocabulary, of which the Current.cz daily published the words in June of this year before the ODS Pre-Electoral Congress, the edition selected 6 examples, in particular those related to the Mary of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf course in Prague", "to the landscape", "boouf's nerve", "the trahision of the capital" and "toler".
Three of the elections were agreed for the fifth, the fourth – Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future – promised first but then did not break the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinke successfully rejected the test.
"I don't care about all these things here and how the representatives of civil democracy are showing up: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with the way we are going to understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he said.
As we have already heard, Lukas Kaucky would not appear in the legend above, but it is about the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaukky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the biggest golf course in Prague".
"It's about tunnel Blanca," Kaucky said, adding immediately, "But I know the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he said.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the wind for the environment, know that the golf truck is the tunnel of Blanco.
The two social-democrats know who's really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the person - he thinks of going to the priestry.
"It's about, I think, going into a business," Plachy is ready to become the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he takes his knowledge rather than the newspapers and not any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no reason to argue in social democracy.
"I have consulted with my colleagues, and it seems that we really have nothing of this kind."
"The names are rather often used in abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socialist-Democratic Party, who called the members of the Party Hilda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this, as told by Karel Brezina about Surnames.
The present day.cz tested the name and it runs.
The Weinert elite is Papy for members of the Party or at least the least the Old Little, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by the scrokeries during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the little player".
Surnames are also the only ones that allow the party to use the social-democrats.
It seems Hulinsky doesn't like much to hear Hilda, but the Akutel.cz daily recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Matraque Law Doctor" recalls that Peter Hulinsky received his doctor's title in law JUDr at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the tortures of "sorcers", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, voiced women have common treaties.
They are part of the old generation, they cannot, for example, work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sorcer" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man's got a very rare purpose."
"We no longer judge young women in good health because they are involved in work and raising children," said a sister who is in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help to limit the casket to rats.
The case is a hic.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," warned daily Die Standard about the inconsistency of written education.
The charge of sorcellery is current in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman was killed after being tortured by three women and then burned with the oil they had shot at.
This is the BBC server that sent this information.
Criminals claim it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual ions was frozen into the woman's contact.
The oil flashed, it stopped, when the team wanted to "shake the bad spirit" of the woman.
Insulation of "sorcers" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Human spirit eatingers have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce the fate of the deaf, Gambia has not seen even the President himself in recent years.
"After the death of his aunt, President Gambien Dzammi launched a broad casserole to the nurses who, he seemed to have participated in his death and would have been forced by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"From Guinea's immediate arrivals, they led to the presidential farm in Kanila, under the protection of the police and the personal custody of the President, men and women elected to Hasard in the villages of Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
Prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion based on hallucinogenic effects that would further affect the kidneys and the intestines.

On international pressure, about a thousand people were released free.
The location of Baal: The burning poles, he signed a higher lodger.
An old taxing man comes from the door of RPG Byty's client centre of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a folder with three new rental contracts for three apartments: the seine, his daughter and his son, who are going to clean up a penalty.
Deregulation has increased the rent of these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500, the son will have to adjust from the next year for a 2+1 apartment of the second category 4400 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heat working on the solid fuel," the man who has the power to sign a new contract on his son's new contract.
"But I signed it at the same time" explains it to you because of anger and half-resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new housing conditions as "immoral and indisputable", advises the tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, the date on which a notice will be published to explain the method to follow.
But man reacts to it by hand.
"One says it, the other says another thing" by frying the sources.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulatory laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic do not meet the market price.
Current.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
The RPG waiting room in the Havirovska street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m. in the morning.
Just outside the door is a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number coming from the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to shine on the big screen at the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but the new tenants don't seem to care about people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to address current problems such as demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 RPG-portfolio apartments are receiving mail with new tickets in their mail box from about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers 15-38 percent rent increases.
the special cookie for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"he's been working for nearly a week, so it's still in the test" responds, after an instance of harassment, the employee behind the girche when the client is presenting as a journalist.
Degradation and old apartments of Bali miners are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the Parliament and the original of the Ostrava Lubomir Zaaralek region of the Democrats has been sufficiently supported before the elections and is now filling the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even changed a patch in the wcs, the man mentioned in the introduction is relieved.
However, above all, these are, according to employees, retirements that come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rent price if they now sign as RPG has promised in a special offer.
It is a return of half of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will sign their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulatory" girche of the Havirovaska street is not really able by the questions.
"Parm the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 are here to rent," said the employee in the gigchet.
And yet RPG puts both on its website and in the veins of individual stakeholders on the loyers when necessary.
If the two parties fail to agree on the case, it is an independent court that will decide.
'It is not a threat, but only to inform you on the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' says RPG on its website.
"No one's going to the court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the client center gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5000 crowns to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee immediately feels bad about the situation.
"We'll come."
"Mr. Zaaralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
Loyer regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rentals do not always reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Paul Klimes, director of the RPG Byty company's residential portfolio, which is just the lack of funds for the housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be made of 5.2 billion.
The large screen expanded to the ceiling in front of the refurbishment of the Havirosvka street guard room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and not less than 31200 apartments are more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments".
"It will always be up to 7.50 Czech crowns a month," says the screen.
The increase of 38 per cent relates to only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
"In these cases, this is an increase in a very low amount of 19.66 Czech roots in m2," added RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase in 4-8 years.
It adds other commitments: all money from the increase in rents (cf. the graph) is made to apartments in the form of heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on increasing rent have priority.
The mother's school is part of, she also has offices that include architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of the Society Arch. Design.
No one could expect that he would also open a native school with all that he needs - color walls, imaginary furniture, games and finally a land of miniature games on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can be given.
The architectic project company Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its maternal business school since the first ruins of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially children, and it was important to him that architects and project heads be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced working time contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. in the framework of its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to engage in work with care for children.
These are the employees of the Arch.Design.They themselves who imagined this maternal school and with the support of the leadership they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The master school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the statistical budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding grants (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they have been able to purchase equipment and equipment and, after two years, provide qualified staff and travel.
After the use of the funding grant (two years) the Arch. Design company has been obliged after 3 years to operate the native school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted for a year and was the Economic Rating company that helped make the application for allocation.
Child care is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a mother’s institution each day care for children. Children can go to maternal school without age limitations, but they have more than three children.
As is the case with a "Minister of Mother’s School" there may be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more than that to replace.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the programme of the maternal school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children only play but a quality education is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation of school banks to the English language.
The class is equipped not only with imaginary games and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of a delay to go looking for children in a remote school from their parents' place of work.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of RHs.
The house in os is still running after 100 years. Take an eye in the interiors of Gaudi.
The toy resembles the two of a prehistoric saurien, the scaffolding of a vertebral column of dinosaurs and the balconies of open fish holes.
That's how the house of Casa Battlo in Barcelona is the house of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received the name of the house in the oss part of the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, car and mosaic fragments, which reminds of the scales and around the edges of the curves, is all that is essential for the Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front of the house surrounds its dream lines, its beautiful colors and textures that remind of nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, we see the geometry, rhythm and order that is precisely considered.
During the night, the face of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit up in such a way that the impression of color brightness is strengthened.
The rotation and rotation of shapes also appear within the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies the windows frame, the balustras, the ornamental elements of the doors, the ojeleton and the lammes.
The house Battlo, which is built in the Eixample district in the Passeig street of Gracia in number 43. It was built from the building of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of another new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house for multiple housing was not meant by Gaudi alone.
Architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on its project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the furniture and the use of the museum for the façade are created.
Other artists and creators also worked for the façade.
The joint work for the house plan of Casa Battlo started with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The houses were named the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms "the House in Os".
In other words, I was referring to the specific window opening mechanism called "the house which is empty".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of the Catalan.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system at its central heating time, with typical air events and roads.
Their 45-degree inclination looks strange.
During Gaudi's creation he did not fully respect the construction directives and did not allow them to be interrupted.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so empty that two years after the end, the municipal council was terrified and requested changes.
For example, it did not favor the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction were impeding on the public trottoir.
There has never been a change, but only 15 days after the call from the city of Joseph Battlo requested (and was satisfied) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner would move to the lower floors.
In the gallery at the second floor there was a common living room and a third room and a private part of the apartment.
The repugnant was praised for a Bijouterie.
The entire six-stage house is divided by a ladder that reaches up to an independent toilet terrace.
All the right angles and the right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi is also working on the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can communicate comfortablely or well limit private space to more intimate stakeholders.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received a non-traditional toilet and two more floors.
Gaudi's game with the light is also impressive, with blue and white vitrators with which the inner court is decorated and with the power of light.
The two-coloured game provides maximum light in all stages of the house.
It was simply enough to reflect on the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The house Casa Battlo which was registered in 2005 in the World Heritage Fund of UNESCO may be visited by everyone.
At the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to break this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and extended the field of visits to the common spaces and the border, including the toilet terraces.
The ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retired, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is even above the entrance price in the other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tower, you must quickly find a friend among the people of the apartment and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mate and a shade: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatoire frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for the kitchen, so the matlas and the shade provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must be complemented in a harmonious manner in order to appeal to a specific user.
During the selection several things are determined: weight, size, age, health status and the gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the table is to be placed and the shade is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the camp house where the latex mats are not always worn, they are not suitable because they are "restraint" gently.
They have, above all, a higher weight than the standard polyurethane table.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilating channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid floor, they maintain moisture.
The usual is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad, often using very spacious matillas with a rammollising layer, will find it difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their fragrant shoes, feet and legs, they needed mats with a rammorming coat of parses."
"It is also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a problem with the nervous system that therefore assumes "information" of the articles and the skin," explains Sylva Adamczkova, who specializes in the reimbursed furniture.
That's why a few years ago the Matals with the Parisese mouse won the hockeyists and other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex, but also the Tropico Czech also have suitable materials.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL to be able to appreciate a beautiful mouse.
That "miracle" just works.
It optimises its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
No pressure on you and you will not return to the night as after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
The walled mouse also serves as a protection against the corners.
To choose the matas depending on your size, add the length of the feet, either about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's comfortable in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are sleeping on the second floor you should put your hands comfortablely with the slightly flat roofs. Helena Prokokova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-Matlasts and Decorators who have been devoted for many years to the problem of a healthy smile and the ergonomics of furniture and education in specialized schools.
For a bed at two places each needs its own summaries and mats, however, attention is paid while selecting the height of the table well.
Otherwise it will only add the summit to different heights and this is not possible on all the bed frames.
Mushrooms should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mats with at least 15 cm, depending on the shape and aeronautical layer of at least 3 cm.
"To touch or sit on the table you shouldn't feel the resources," warns Héléna Prokokova.
Each table requires a well-defined type of summary.
The bed-room, when the table and the bedroom are united as symosh sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to cover.
The tables were very bad; we don't have to wash them, which is very hard today.
And since during the night it is usually transpired from 0.2 to 0.75 litres of water it is clear that after 5/7 years, the body begins to remember a large (and bunk) Tamis.
For this reason, experts refuse to make the claim on a 25-year-old life term for a matelas or life guarantee.
But it's all about it.
And for this, an expert advice from the sellers' side: for a 120/140cm table, renounce, for re-opening the table, to the hygiene or washing but add a protective table that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if in our day it is common to make re-containings with glazing closures for the whole, it is said that after opening two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) but the manipulation for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed from a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid ceiling in your bed instead of a summer?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the plane (if it does not exist) of aircraft trolls and use a 15cm minimum height of arable materials (Germany Taschenfederken) and an airbag.
A polyurethane matrix must not be part of a list of this type.
For single-position snakes with 14/18 snakes, latex or sandwich mats (maybe the combination of latex and coconut snow) are the ideal, but this will always be better for you to have a table with more snakes, 28 and above, where the snakes are doubled in the bottom of the kidney and that it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mats, you do not need to take mats from your sources because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to the rigidity of the needles, what is called an epal bear may also be installed.
This is a special connection to the legs that enables pressure to penetrate the needle so that the shoulder of the bedroom is "integrated" well.
For men who have "the shoes as wide as the two," it's really an important thing.
This is already considered by the masculins manufacturers who have started using a rammollescent area at the spas level.
But they also think of women - they once again offer them a softer surface at the corner level.
For the most difficult customer, there are salts onions or plates with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure is dissipated in more than one point and reduces tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad ear (large and airflow) on good bodies and summers, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple hearer: the earring must support the head and its points must only reach the shoulder, so that the muscles of the shoulder can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians simply prefer.
When extended on the side, the eagle must set the height of the shoulder (with the backbone of the shade or the shoulder area in the matlas).
The modern mats still have something common to the first ones based on wood and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in the biomass.
The first materials based on petroleum, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use the soya.
"The Bio qualification for meat means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for the coatings of the table; one of the first was true gold.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes from the forest or laundry.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of boulevard plants to absorb heat and cool the body, "refroid" man, the respirators "shaupen" women.
The extract of red powder accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for the weak sex.
Current preferences?
The meats made from frozen mousse (she has more pores with a broken cell structure, so more breathable than standard polyurethane and more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of the frozen molluscs provides polyzone matillas that know exactly where the head, bottom and feet are located.
You have a quality table from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterised by their health parameters are less than VAT and are treated as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Economicizing for the matlas and the summer is not easy.
In time, there may be special actions on the part of manufacturers or two materials producers for the price of one single.
As for example, Magniflex company offers Duofreeze matlas with the memory museum, which is due to the repertoire for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of parses or viscoelastic mice with an open cell structure and a large spacer was started with the material Tempur at a "cosmic" rate.
This began as a matter for NASA because the astronomers led to the start of enormous load factors.
The Tempor falls into the heat and, on the contrary, breaks into the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is for this ideal against bad sleep and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic muscles are used not only for the muscles but also for the health products, such as the special tips for the feet that lower the legs and the visual system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver mouse or the same type.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child increases more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be well used to track people's movement and help in some cases such as the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a bottle of aluminum but will soon be of the size of a display.
The case of little Anicka has attracted a great number of people and they have started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private life.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I believe there may be cases of bad use of such devices, such as placing them in the bag of someone who is not currently present, but I have not yet met such cases."
"Most people are customers who really buy the product for security reasons, Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know how to use "the boat" and how to use it in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child doesn't want to bring on him something like this, he'll get rid of them.
It is even the smallest that can show great creativity when it comes to falling apart from something when they don't want to be under control."
"Telephones, which can be purchased like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long-term expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very controversial.
"If it's a ready rap, the author will do everything to make the child have no electronic device that can locate it."
"Now, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (the criminals) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be on the police," said the psychologist.
It has everything that such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, who offers traffic services both for cars and for people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device may be fitted in such a way as to be in regular emission after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The most expensive devices also have an inclineometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and returns to a long position without bending," Cech says.
According to him, the portable telephones of intelligent speakers who are equipped with a navigation system can offer a service comparable after having trained with a special professional.
The problem of the current tracking systems is that it is of a device similar to those bearing the size of an alllumette bottle or of the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, why tests are currently being carried out to make devices similar to common digital displays.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll take account of them after some time, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a brush or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
It is a combination of purchasing systems of a GPS position (which is used closely in auto navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonators that it could make the turn of the Czech Republic with it, but it can only have two years.
The army bought 445 km of wires used for explosives.
The Ministry of Defence has already bought 224 km since last year.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of cordages is two to four years maximum.
The army bought discounts to the anonymous STV Group company for 40 million crowns.
The general government has given as a result of the purchase of a huge amount of detonators to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the booking calculations made by the military pyrotechnics who contacted MF DNES, it was noted that even generals, officers with an order, secretaries or household personnel should have an annual exercise for explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, the commander of the army are not exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonators.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the military reserves could come down there for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient for more than 2 m of detonators, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption of special units and genes - reservations for the above 225 years.
While the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their punitive weapons and that the withdrawal sessions are limited because of the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body language.
"And I don't take my head if they buy us a lot of detonators."
"It's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive to be happy merchants," said STV Group Jan Decky's commercial director.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that the army will have these "munitions" for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, was only four years of life of the detonators and the police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are perfectly engaged in deposits, it can go even to four years," said one who does not want his name to be published in respect of the military criticism.
The duration of life, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The Ministry's other argument is a huge amount of 445 km of detonators.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 245 km," notes Pejsek's spokesman, who gave the public opinion of the Department of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of pirotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the second world war or even after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always only orders the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for the security reasons of pyrotechnics and for more flexible access to more modern and more reliable types of detonating wires.
the Department of Defence today has serious problems for the neutralization of tens of thousands of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the heavy Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand men were preparing to move, head over the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNA has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of miles of old detonators that it buys today "good market".
To this day, I benefit from contacts I have received through the competitions.
The French sales of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition from the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lucas Pytloun is a traveler.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia, he lacked a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had gained when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small 5-half-demoli apartment.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher studies, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the property he converted into pension with 54 liters.
Since then, his work as a entrepreneur has allowed him to open 4 pensions in Liberiac, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 litres of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them were up to the last four Pytloun stars.
This year, he experienced another of the same quality.
"We just came to sign a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tisse where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the French of the Pytloun hotels", the number 1 of the entrepreneurs last year.
"It is for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the company of the year has served well, adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and around.
"People recognized me in the streets, often welcomed me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition with all those who strive to do something.
This is not necessary to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he used his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not otherwise obtain.
"With those I met through the competition, I began to enjoy commercial relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation for success had also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
"I observe in them the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that was generally recognized."
"It is not, and far from, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work for all of us.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I want my successor a year better than the one we had in Farmet.
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind it.
The one who came looking for the price in Slovakia for the first place of competition for the Company of the Year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky, the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury won the effort with which he turned a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm in the number of 100 million crowns.
I can say that the reward not only encouraged me and my colleagues, but also increased our confidence in themselves to fight competition," says the winner of the competition last year today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, he wanted to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the acquisition of goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long ago, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some friends in his father's funeral for the manufacture of plastic bathers.
Not long after they started to specialize in the press for vegetable oil.
He has become the largest manufacturer of automatic press in Central Europe for the next eighteen years.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to get to know the Farmet brand but foreign partners also began to realize that they were working with a company that had achieved the greatest success in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the school year did not pass to Farmet only in the euphoria of the winner.
The company's assessment was made from the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and start to limit their acquisitions of new materials and technologies.
"We have certainly not escaped from this situation."
"The business figures have fallen by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even license," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society needs to know that, in time, it is necessary to take unnecessary measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained the results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without commitment to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with grants, strengthened society's presentation in international exhibitions and received the main rewards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
We all think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is also reimbursed.
"A new winner I want this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that deletes unintended regulations.
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time part of the business chain.
Some absurd regulations may have been deleted.
The small honorary winner of this year's survey on Absurdity of the year was the obligation to submit to the offices of documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted in favour of this.
For example, social business administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register, while the staff member could obtain it in two clicks of tears.
It's changed by the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the trade registry for insurance checks," said Jana Buranova, the Czech Social Insurance Administration's spokesman (CSSZ).
Taking all the rules and orders that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's Absurdity competition.
This investigation is yet another year for the fourth time part of the business plan organised by Hodórske noviny and has an even greater popularity.
If the last 3000 votes were made last year, at least 4000 this year had brought their vote.
And that's not surprising, in our country there's already the most different legal obligations that make it more difficult for the company, and, more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for the first places in the world," says Karel Havlick of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Enterprises in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all Governments in recent years.
Compared with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is located at the 74th floor for the conditions for the company, 8 more than last year.
The annual Absundity competition was first launched in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can make an administrative and bureaucratic absurdity every year from April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To make sure that the website is available at www.fifiroku.cz. Next, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.fifiroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
Absurdity, which received the largest number of votes, is declared a vainqueur.
Until the last year's investigation, it is a hundred or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
Notes are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there is a requirement that car maintenance vehicles and fast roads pay their wages, or even that entrepreneurs with twenty employees represent two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which begins in early November on the Veneslas Square in Prague, is part of a hangening that regularly participates in political and public life personalities.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Peter Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended at the time of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts actors in the hands of entrepreneurs, and for this reason my goal is to remove, each year, at least three decades of paragraphs that today only make business complicated," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to wipe out absurd wastes is not a drop in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual enterprise at the place where the company was located, the intention of going to an exhibition or a pilotage with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare a service travel to a foreign employee for 30 days to the Office of Labour, was deleted with the text of the Law on what the white card is called.
And it's all eight to the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the destruction of physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was amended by the order of the Department of Health last year by the obligation to have a refrigerator removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or even sports projects have been evaluated.
The new year of Hodórske Noviny’s competition, which has existed for five years, is the category called the 2010 Responsible Company.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and just business.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and carry out a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, Regional Manager of the Portal telephone operator, firm Vodafone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of competition for the rebellion of the year.
For this first year of this sub-categories of the 2010 firm, organised by the Vodaphone firm, companies that have not succeeded in achieving a long-term objective for the company are registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article should be edited.
Although the object of their enterprise is different from one another, their support and forecast activities can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Of the fourteen finalists for all the Czech Republic, there is no example of the association of pragose and Netera who support the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main contributor to the grant fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
In the case of employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant which employs more than 70 per cent and for which it has obtained the title of the company responsible for the central Bohéme region and which is thirdly located in the region in the competition for the company of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company that has been granted to introduce busy working hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week by average and, without proportionally reducing pay.
The jury also owes its title because it has priority for Czech manufacturers, supports a daily activity in the vicinity of the environment and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryzzarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible IT Sign up of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each portable computer a chair and ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected vehicle for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the dream that helps the local Roma community," said Andrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In all the latter, there is also a Lavage and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the Czasch bruntal construction company, a winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the responsible company category, all regional finalists for Vodafone's company competition, who had answered the questionnaires in a joint part of the registration document and sent it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incomplete or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in the league had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition of the company of the year of Vodaphone".
"Independent subscriptions are not possible because it is a sub-categories of the major competition of the Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organisational agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police conducted arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police has been under arrest in recent days.
The detectives passed the minutes to the local entrepreneur and traded with Lubos. G.
This was an effort to just manipulate a call for public tenders for the settlement of a request for refund in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay a half million crowns to Lubos G.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police continue to prosecute a person in the context of a bid and a public contest." said Pravo, head of the Plzen Park Antonie Zelena, aware that he is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police returned after 24 hours this 46-year-old freeman.
In order to know how it could influence public competition, we can only express ourselves with such little official information.
In a question of Pravo, the spokesman of the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that the police had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate job site and that was during the public competition.
"It is a client and in no case an employee, it has been specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call for rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is implemented when several legal candidates appear.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to residences that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"The proposed rights of a class of buyers are established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Lubos G. had, of course, information about the persons who were in the appeal and, as he himself is, a person who would benefit because he had purchased a large number of right of return, he had proposed to the local candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he was no doubt tired of leaving.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpolation.
Lubos G. had extensive contacts above standards in FdT (Funds of Lands).
In the case of the former chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing lands for which the decision to install a building had already been issued.
Only Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanges it with the Mary for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is much higher.
The mill was obliged to accept because it would not endanger the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional percentage of monthly rents for the accommodation.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places will also increase rent.
The families should therefore draw from January to a hundred times more monthly than now.
The electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, the gas of almost 2 per cent more, in some locations you have to pay up to a tenth of the water supply and in many places the central heating supplies will also be expensive.
Increased electricity should be available for households in apartment 100 towers annually more than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices by providing sensitive development to encourage renewable energy production, including photovoltaic pills.
The gas increases slowly, but of course, when people need heat and thus have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count on a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas increase throughout the Czech Republic, the price change of central heating varies from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, homes in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will be paid in January for the central heating of nearly 50 korongs per month, the Liberian families will pay more than 1000 korrones per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, there is an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation for the case where the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rents do not change the prices, an additional 6.8 per cent will be paid.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest compared with the whole country.
In Bohéme of the north, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns Usti nad Labem almost 2,500 apartments, has decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rent will be referred to the courts by society.
The regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children are tired of the rhumm and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and does everything in a gentle manner.
The fernet, rhum, vodka and otherwise the best whisky brand are also available to parents.
These are the most common drinks that burn, which are not yet fifteen years old, among the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the rehabilitation hospital are not the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children from hospitals.
"Births or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
'The trend is really strong alcohols', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in central Bohéme.
"When they succeed in catching a bottle of pop in the arms, it's about some whisky, but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with the fruit juice and thus do not feel it," explains the Chief of the Department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokesman for Motol Hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's from the rhum or the fernet."
"It is today alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it's a slivove that they threw away from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the head of the Pélikan department, seeing Irish children aged 13 to 40 at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice for the last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years just in pediatricia where the ambulances were threatening the schools of the whole world.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at twelve years of age when she was mixed with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with an extra mixture with extsay," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibitions Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that he doesn't seem to be surprised to his mother that his daughter is absent at 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the disinterest of parents or their tolerance outside the community to the fact that their resistance to alcohol is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, we do not speak of independence, in its strict sense, for children.
"A chronic dependence on alcohol for several years is understood under the alcoholic vocabularies with all the phenomena that come out of it, but it is not found in children."
"For those who use the alcohol to repeat it, it is rather a social-family background that is significantly undesirable," explained the Chief of the Department of Pélikan.
According to Jurinova, about forty Irish children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the Paediatric Clinic in Motol.
They are not integrated into the statistics but cases with an intoxicating stomach that requires hospitalization.
Irregular children who are following emergency care collected at home by their parents or by the police are not accountable.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, there are three seasonal vogues with which you can count: the day of the sorghums, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Whether they smoke out after bad results or instead they celebrate the start of vacations."
"Of course, I have lived on the day of the tears as a single day of adoption of seven blind children," Pélikan pointed out.
The Hebrew child who spent the night at the hospital in disinfection under medical control is in a paradoxic position better than the one who comes home and suffers the next day of the "wood hole".
The headaches of the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are for this better lotis because they spend an excellent night and then a gentle light and nothing harms them."
"They are only surprised at the place where they are," Pélikan adds, knowing that from time to time, the good humor of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Travel by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care can reach tens of thousands of people.
"From time to time, I have applied it as a means of education to these children, according to how much their income has cost, and that they could spend all their time in seasonal work to pay a single night," Pélikan added.
However, he said that health insurance companies in their regression management, who should recover from parents care-related burdens, do not treat cases of ill-treatment.
Two L-159 planes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five in all, to which the Ministry of Defence has changed the transport aircraft of Casa C-295M, cancelled Tuesday for Séville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS is located.
This is the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone else than the Czech army.
However, they were abroad in terms of exercise or demonstration flights.
It is a biplatic version of the L-159T1 that has so far been in service in the Czech army and that has been in flight.
Other devices are monoplasic versions of L-159.
These stop for the moment at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial media - Omnipol firm - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Press of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is for an unknown moment.
"The L-159 monoplaces for the exchange were taken on long-standing aircraft without additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence".
"The L-159 T1 libraries have been changed in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He pointed out that the army would not remain without a Biplace because the Department signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement of a value of 200 million korones for the transformation of four L-159 unutilized monoplats in two biplaques.
The army received delivery of the first device in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, he committed himself to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"In the contract it is clear that the one taking the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will serve as pilots in NATO's member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one taking account of how to accomplish this," Pejsek said.
Homoarske Noviny announced that the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was completed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence has not launched tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defence management argued that the exchange ensured a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 devices at Aero Vodochody and used only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in the form of a call for tenders at the European level and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already delivered three cars from Casa, the last should arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the non-cancer is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the unladen are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the length relative to the right is a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at Warwick University.
The duty could thus help determine which men should be subject to the prostate cancer test, including by combining genetic risk or other worsening factors such as family health prioritises, Heeles added.
During the 1994-2009 period, she and her colleagues in Great Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the Cancellation.
For them, like 19 percent of those who had the same length of time, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
However, in the case of those who had the longer index than the casualty risk rate, 33 per cent fell, for men 60 years ago, the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The long-term report of two dozen cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterine.
At least testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is just the testosterone that helps develop a prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he was in the course of this study but that he did not seem to think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer was "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 vehicles are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this morning's Thursday covered by snow.
On the roads and the trottoirs, most of the time of the compact snow, the deflators worked all night in many places.
The D5 car is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93th mile towards Rozwadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 highway in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The car dealer of the Central Club (UAMK) told her about the information
In the 21st mile, a truck was struck, and in the 93th two heavy weights were damaged, the accident was damaged.
Several cars were also found in the closet.
The problems are also on the D1 road to 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit.
Drivers should just leave Brno at 190 km or go by Brno and then enter 182 km to Kyvalka.
A multi-kilometre car file was formed in this area.
Also on the D11 car, there is an accident and, that is, just after arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a cloud layer of several centimetres of space, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car files such as Prosek, the Sterboholska street is also busy.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take, for example, from the line between Place Charles (Karlowe Namsti) and the Place of Peace (Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, Prague's major crisis state must still meet.
The railways and airports also face problems.
The Chechnya roads have already had to be removed because of the snow 7 fast links.
The lines, for example, from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 p.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already routable but in a resurgence of surveillance.
On Vyskov's road, three side roads are imprecise, Brno's road begins to be in the snowy areas, and Blansko's road is mandatory to pass some communication paths in the higher places.
The Vyskov region was part of the most affected areas.
To date, the axes are closed: Rosinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kücerov and Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, we may need to send snowflakes and phrases.
We can't wait for the moment when they'll be roulable.
On the road to Hodonin, the mind is strong in the region of the White Carpathies.
On the roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, which is only maintained by the assumption of inert products, there is also a 5-centimeter-to-inch layer of snow warning CTK.
In Czech, he fell between two and 10 inches of snow; he fell most often in Bohéme of the north, with up to 18 inches of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell to 15 inches [15 cm] of snow.
The earthquake struck in Chechnya progressively.
The Americans have a new "intellectual weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, only known as XM-25 code name.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an impact on the conflict there with the Taliban and "I will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate canon
Its projects are guided by lasers with a precision of a few meters.
The 25 mm calibre special munitions developed for this fuel and containing a highly fragile explosive actually work as small granite.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will exploit the target contact but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So we can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a hole.
He's no longer protected from it, and when he falls over a deadly oil spill, it can also put him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first child army to use the "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier serves them primarily in such a way as to find the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and supports the prisoner.
"Let's say you looked at 543 meters."
"When you press the prisoner, the weapon is loaded and taken to 543 meters more or less, 1, 2, 3 meters, said Audette.
400 delocated jobs
The Fujitsu group delocates its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 employees will move to Astro Park to their place of work, which is currently located at the premises of Place Mareinbader in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu delocates its subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As Mercredi declared the specialized engineer in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the job of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader site of Bad Homburg City, will be transferred to Astro Park, an enormous complex of offices located on the Lyon Straße Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Frankfurt.
A voice from Fujitsu explained that in the mid-term, the group should group 100 other jobs still scattered up to this point in the region.
The offer of accommodation was extremely attractive. In addition, the open air offices of Astro Park are better suited to the working methods of employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director-General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is our primary location with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that the airport connection is just of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important enterprise within the region caused the happiness of the beneficiaries yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losses.
Mr. Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been so successful.
It's an "external profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees with the city and its implantation is an important milestone for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg's mother, Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The direction was very early to inform the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships would have nothing to change the difficulty of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the Marinebader Place furniture.
Finally, economic reasons would have been determined.
It is now about avoiding that such an exceptional place is not occupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the property of the Place of the Hotel of the City, used so far by the nearby Fujitsu and the "vertical stone" company, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the construction project in question at the thermal station.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance of the city was created between the park and the city Hotel. This resulted in many criticisms, not only because of the impressive setting of the surfaces that sometimes served in part of the parking area, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the furniture.
In 2006, the German Group of Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group in Tokyo is considered the third largest supplier of information products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential services.
Its subsidiary located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other branches present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park property.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-form plan, opens up among others the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industries.
Exulsion of the server by Amazon - Measures against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon released the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may be hidden from political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is attacked with increasing force.
The "Wikileaks" cyberactivist group has no longer access to its host server until now in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, American Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies Wikileaks Boycotter.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is researched by Interpol, is probably staying in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wickleaks except the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," the cyber-activists indicated Wednesday (local time) at the beginning of the revelations through the Twitter social network.
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
Following the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists have applied to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues to reveal: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
The CNN television channel, quoted by Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon forbade Wikileaks to use his servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to host a boycott, reported the British newspaper The Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take this step as soon as possible with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, inhuman and unsubstantiated ways. This is the way it endangers our national security and endangers life all over the world," according to a statement by independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether it is American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the documents. "
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is researched by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of violence, is listed by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", Australia, 39 years old, lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where to find it.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified as orchestralized inductors for the follow-up made to him by Sweden.
Wikileak's spokesman, Kristin Hraffsson, said in London that threats were posed against the site.
"The appeals have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange fears especially for his safety, said Hraffsson.
That's why Wikileaks' founder continues to hide.
Hraffsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileak's disclosures be continued and executed for trafficking.
In Canada, the Chief of Government, Stephen Harper, announced on television that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
During this time, a Polynesian emerged between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, US President Barack Obama's spokesman, described as "rical and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange had demanded the resignation of State Secretary Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to the diplomats, and recently declared himself to be released from spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual owned by a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. Government is now fully in the process of trying to protect its databases.
According to a communication from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for fighting refugees.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the desire to verify the means by which the whole administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. Government announced that it would like to take care of the security of the dissidents and militars if they were never threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that seems necessary."
The University of Glace
At the Gelato University of Bologna, we prepare ice compressors for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day launch course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted to visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where does all the ice come from?
Of Glacier and the ice machine.
The glass, that is, in Germany, the glass compressor slightly decomposed, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian glass manufacturing art.
The glass turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerator by means of a spatula, it is available in the refrigerator and then begins to sell.
To know, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, can't avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian Carpigian firm.
The sorbets manufacturer founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams come out of its machines all the way to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day launch course organized for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted to visitors from around the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended for several days. Practice sessions are also organized in private ice cream.
In the full crisis of the quarantine, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply at risk to achieve their burning desire for fresh ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art from California, is a graduate of the Low Food Movement. He wants to propose a European product of quality in the country of industrial glass.
Anke de Berlin is a business manager, and she wants to take something unique from this nerve test after a few years.
Two Egyptian young people dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman is here because her children worship Italian ice cream.
The glacial teacher Luciano Ferrari first explained to participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is determined not only by good wisdom but also by the smoothness and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget in the course of training the request for the coat of national sovereignty and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still maintains a sacred dose of romance."
The first stage in the manufacture is quite simple.
Luciano refers to basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixture that heats up to 85 degrees with an electronic program, then quickly cools up to four degrees.
It then opens a robot installed on the machine: it has a leathery white base cream, based on all kinds of ice cream.
The trainer is easily asking the question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano cautioned against the fact that he was wrong by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks of only "made from natural ingredients" may have used it to stabilizers: most often a natural product, such as the grain of guarantor obtained from the guarantor.
Of course it is possible to manufacture ice without using a stabiliser, only it needs to be sold within a 24-hour period, but it will fall and the customer will not cross anything but ice granules.
Some changes to the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more passionate with the aromas.
Master Luciano sets out the difference between the ingredients obtained in the fruit or concierges of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastries.
"the suppliers will try all of you to represent dozens of aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Both in the recipes of sorbets to fruits with sugar and fresh fruits.
Both in the ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and is, when added to the cocoa powder, the base of all the deserts possible for chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course have to go through the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites you to make four types of ice at the time: the Vanilla, the Chocolate, the Moca and the Noisette with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less Vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different types of ice for fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not much better.
The ice for nuts doesn't hold the taste of the night, when it is made up mostly of nuts.
The oil in kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and less stabiliser.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly restores the taste of a glass," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise of calculation: if it is used for the pure fishery with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for the ice in the lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winners are used to measure the size of Oechsle in the root mouse).
Fortunately, tables facilitate calculations.
The production of ice is no longer necessary, as sometimes as much as physical intervention.
This is not just the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice is being cut simultaneously to make it dark and exposed to negative temperatures.
Despite all automation, small panels are not excluded.
Bréssilien Gustavo barbows the fruit of his head to his feet and thus becomes enslaved to his fellow students when the control of the migrating ball ball is out of him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident is likely to occur in each course: it's not just a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguity position
According to some sources, the industry that experienced the culture of genetically modified plants has weakened the European Food Safety Authority.
This claim is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institution for the evaluation of the effects of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a theory of conspiracy, but we are well informed," said Mercredi to Munich M. Christoph Thenn, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information is that the president of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been working in a decisive way to develop the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The written requirements correspond in text to the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the trademark of the industry, which, in substance, would be controlled by the authorities located in Parme, Italy.
It's the second time Testbiotech has declared a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking officer of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss Group without conditions or periods of transition. As a result, she changed from camp.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and the industrial lobby, which raised both the concerns of the German Federal Agency for the Environment and the European Members.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data are used, including those of the industry, as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on the Efsa account are not prohibited from putting in contact with this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute of Life Sciences (Ilsi) based on the United States.
This body is considered to be a neutral forum involving experts who, among others, belong to science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being on the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then fail to see that genetically modified plants are accepted without any food test in animals and that they have not been tested for the environmental impact of these plants.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize on the field," said Mr. Thenn.
The current practice consists of testing only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plants, which does not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look at the risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then about your defendant.
It's also Ms. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at Zurich's Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is trying to further influence or expose critical scientists.
That is why there are still researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls security research".
The Track of Stone
Uli Gsell searched for it, about 400 pounds.
Monday after noon, she was in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube at two.
There was a manoeuvre.
He was wrong.
The story is known: In September, excavators had arrived and had begun to decompose a large part of the northern island.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people have demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central train into a underground train that will cost several billion.
A large part of the island was in ruins when the exhibitions started at the end of the construction work.
Braceled in 6,000,7000 murces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillar calcair) of Crailsheim, a tentacles and masculinator built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor who lives in Ostfieldern.
Some fragments have been searched.
"These stones are relics."
"They don't have to shoot."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and good market, simple and land-based rock."
He claims that when he went to the store, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with this fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old warehouse of the French army ammunition in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is selling old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were wounded or disappeared in the abyss," he said in his office in a cave, which was once a guard post.
He reported that he had been subjected to insults and threats when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the North Aile to the demolition company.
However, he has negotiated with the S21 project opponents for all days.
And he explained that he could not do anything to resist the demolition.
And if she did, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried one of the weighted 80 kilograms of stone parallepipede, the value of which is between 6,50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory in mind while also hoping to make it during a reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 full trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest have been long sold.
Proprietaries of gardens, landscaped gardens, Particuliers.
They came everywhere and carried everything they could into the coffee shop and the trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart scandal have long been transformed into "Mäerle" or limited to herbs-band plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"this political component has not been used."
He enters his car all over the country, making the tour of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did legal studies that he left. Later, he started studying biology before he became interested in the information and eventually became a career.
And a stone lover.
The stock 40000 tonnes.
He loved treasure all over Germany.
He claims he's the biggest merchant of ancient stones.
He's re-examined.
Sandstones carved with art are placed on the snow.
"At times, they were part of the Marienbrück bridge in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, say it with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He's taking the way up through the forest.
It shows a bag of doigt: Pierre de sable red, above, part of Karlsruhe's garage.
That's it.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelepipede became a part of the Nightstadion Court of Stuttgart.
In the snow of stones and history, the Cannstatt crossing from the prefecture of the police, the red granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, the tube from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what joy!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were carved into his hand and moved with the help of simple rocks and carts drawn by boulevards, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in place."
He didn't become rich, even less demanding.
But today, this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone jars, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass sink and a gardener have been installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's grateful," says the waste recycling.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
Also, there are stones to save.
The fight for talent to compete for high potential
The accountant knows a live affluence.
16 students are busy buying small bread for the salmon, tomato sauce and white-manganese.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
In the framework of a kind of competition, they need to talk about the car of the future with VW designers, and, in the past, to know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to compete for better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multi-form cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most expensive diplomats in the amphitheaters as soon as possible before they arrive on the labour market and they are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, they are trying to detect exceptional talents in the framework of practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at Brauschweig Technical University, the car group loves the talent.
A young staff service lady shares the styles, benefits and cards that feature the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of careers and student jobs for young talented people; she shows them the ways to access the group's nest.
This is Nico Sele of Braunschweig Technical University, which is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Studies are in contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can get to know students, look closer to serious candidates and appreciate those who go online as a collaborator."
According to M. this, such cooperation is inadvertent.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract the students.
"At the same time, the emphasis was rather on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become much closer.
In the interests of the sectors, businesses can no longer recruit their employees by making a three-year term for candidates.
But they must win their trust and, above all, cut the hand of highly qualified workers.
This is especially the degree of engineering filters that are in excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 jobs of engineers remained unattended in October.
And according to the VDI's forecast, the gap in engineering posts will still grow.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent store for the KPMG account, audit office, accounting expert and advice.
It organises expensive events to recruit talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a type of paper rally where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to the United States in this way.
Participants can visit the KPMG branches and get to know the company.
The person who should participate in the selection procedure shall decide ahead of time after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of many candidates will be covered for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the resources used for the survey of higher potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to get out of the boat through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruiser was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we remain in contact with all those who have participated in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he said.
In addition to the direct amalgamation carried out in the fields, small and medium-sized enterprises are in a purely classic way by participating in professional times where they are delivered to the brains.
"We are trying to reach the graduates by participating in professional halls."
"For example, in the solar technology hall," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, making photovoltaic panels.
This company installed in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the problem related to recovery.
Currently, 35 posts are awarded on the company's website.
"At this point, it's very difficult to make vacations."
"It costs a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of performing professional courses or writing his final study project to us."
Honorable advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
That is why the company tries to make its advertising by applying other qualities: personalised environment, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Many times, a large group can't do that," said Mrs. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played a key role in the search for employment.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are other determinant factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld is one of the 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employees.
To this end, he asked his colleagues about their degree of satisfaction in relation to their work and their context, while looking at employees' frameworks.
The head of staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this location will allow the image of society to be raised to employers.
"I believe that candidates are primarily reimbursed to external evaluations concerning a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employee Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advised his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, first of all, internal action.
"The best means for an attractive employee is to pass by his own employees," he said.
This is called, according to the corner used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own effectiveness.
"the happy collaborators form the best messages."
When you treat your employees well and they identify themselves with the company, they only make their employer's advertising with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing it in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on the new oil fields
There will be no new oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida, the southern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has declared a ban an equivalent ban and has finally cancelled its initial plans.
Even along the Atlantic coast, new forests remain under ban.
The Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, made this announcement Wednesday.
This is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon discharge platform, which is the source of this strict ban. It must remain in force for at least five years.
In the face of this incident, which cost 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under the pressure of opposition and of this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to allow for new deforestation in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico to take place.
The parties to this solution wish to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of knowing who bears the responsibility for the dark black marina in the golf course is not so far definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of charges.
A commission of inquiry established by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, raised the gel of the forest described after the platform explosion.
Following this decision, various oil groups had promptly submitted requests for new removal projects.
With stricter controls and more severe security signals, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent control authority, which has been deposed after many allegations of corruption, is currently making the subject of profound reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would suppress the fiscal deficits of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly on guard against the fact that the consumption of food in the golf course would be significantly lower than the case so far.
"The Government's objective is to ensure rapid growth in the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit office, before the ban on deforestation said Wednesday.
In addition, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "People don't know what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been returned to the new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry.
The water that flows into the rivers is brown; it emits a smell similar to that existing in the gas station: Due to an escape, thousands of tons of crude oil have destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live with volition, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't exaggerate," the environmentalist launched to the journalists to calm them: "You still have enough oil bubbles in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man who was immersed in the drinking water to the poitrine, as well as the fat training that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glass of water in the color of the sky.
It can't be seen that the sun's subsampling of raw oil napps.
On the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badum relates that she was, by the way, collecting creams from all over the lakes here.
But in the meantime the quiet waters have completely starved.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came from an oil spill that had exploded in the vast seas.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo now have to spend six hours reaching seawater: The country of Ogoni, located in the heart of the Delta of Niger, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the width of the shrubs greets the eyes as we cross the mangrove walls across watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat sinks a crater water. Anyone spreads his hand to remove any oil covered.
The roots of the mangroves emerge from the soil as well as the balsams. Insulated palm trees leave their palm trees unscathed.
We're looking for birds' nests, as we usually meet in cold areas: Since the engine outboard stops, a fantastic silence lies on this paradise sometimes similar to that of a service station by the noise it emits.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battle field that has been occupied for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers were imprisoned here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wawa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because it had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni country is prohibited to this company: whereas more than 2 million black gold barrels are daily pumped with more than 5,000 drills and 7000 kilometres of olive oil throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploded, as the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters are drawn into the water of steel tiles like strange sculptures: "Noël trees" are very nicely designed for the heads of dry grass.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them run by the corrosion until the rehearsal.
Akpobari considers that a head of this nature is falling from time to time in ice, because a constant flow of red oil in the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres were broken down on the ecosystem at 50 years of age: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that spent in the sea during the accident of the super-petroleum "Exon Valdez" 21 years ago in Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Who must bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides actors.
For the Shell group, the sobotage and syphoning of olives are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution. Environmentalists for them consider the explosions of dry heads and perforated olives as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner called on the Shell Group to apply significantly less strict security standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world: Only the failure rate of conduct is "more high than allelements".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, from a distance, resembles a abandoned workshop, full of trucks and fitted to the open air: They are completely naked and covered with trucks up to the shore.
A spark-ignition fire under one of the many tunnels that are so connected to the tunnels, so filled with no reason on the site should be repaired: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
In the first time, the essence is poured into a container through pipes and then, at the end of the conduct of kirosene gouts falling and it is finally obtained from diesel.
That's what Michael and his four colleagues produce every day four bottles of Diesel of 300 litres: "This tells us 34,000 Naira," about $22.
The Delta residents took part in the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producer country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than that slightly below 40 cents of euro per letter of Diesel: They buy their first material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the oil pipeline network across the country of Ogoni. Experts say the country loses at least 16 million litres of raw oil throughout the country of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the first provisionally submitted matter is illegally cleaned: The organized crime networks that also count among its members of high-ranked politicians and soldiers, buy the part of the lion in tankers and the brand on the world market.
Militant Akpobari considers that the debate on the issue of whether the environmental disaster should be attributed to the population or to the way it is done is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intrusions and if the foundations of the lives of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor flight and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell has been so damaged that it was no longer the issue of withdrawal from the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will be better exposed."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It is a great time for you to disappear" announces the open robot of the oil.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not do the object of an arrest, but, most of all, they will be able to offer them.
Even the soldiers of the north of the country, above all, intend to take advantage of all the Nigerians of the first matter.
"At any rate, this trick trick hit our country well below," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover building defects in A380 reactors
A380 is apparently suffering from a serious security problem.
In examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction failure that could lead to a "distortive failure of the reactor."
The Kantas Air Company wants to present a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had apparently had more chance: During the investigation that it carried out, the Australian air security authority found that some A380 aircraft reactors had a serious safety problem and kept in mind a possible failure to build.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It may cause fatigue and discharges at the level of oil conduction, indicated in a public position on this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a disaster of reactors.
The Rolls-Royce reactors are concerned with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which was due to arrive on November 4th in Singapore, is one of these.
The Australian airline has now engaged in judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint to an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allowed her to take other legal measures against society.
Quantas' director, Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages related to the incident that occurred early in November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it's oil inflammation that's the source of waste.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, the ASSTB spokesman, Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the Quantas air carrier had real estate on the ground all its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines was temporarily reallocated three of its A380 ports.
Lufthansa replaced, as a precaution, an A380 reactor.
The two-stage plane is the world's largest line plane.
The drop of snow across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany's entire white cover: In one night the snow fell on almost the whole country.
The chaos rule on all roads, trains and airplanes.
At least three people are killed in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany gratified: Due to the cool temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, which leads to chaos in many places.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimetres per place.
The movement is severely restricted on several road and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were not able to come to the end of the snow that had not stopped to warm up.
In addition, violent raphales swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) is waiting for these sea-seas races to take place in the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1.2 m above normal.
The snowy tastes on the roads and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxe.
That's why the weather alert centre Meteomedia announced the level of violent alert has been announced in the Saxony: in fact, it's the highest level.
In some places, there were 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong winds and costs scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the country of Saxe-Anhalt, police authorities announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 highway, the snow and wind caused a stop in the movement and caused the mouth.
In Thuringe, snowfalls hit the A4 and A9 road.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious traffic disturbances occurred in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringe and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are the snow on the railways, the trees fallen on the ferret roads, the canals or the destroyed needles.
In Saxe, interregional transport in Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Salfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train to Munich had to stop his trip.
The puppies and paramedics had to provide 165 passengers of the train with cover, food and drink.
Winds of snow washed the roads.
The snowflakes have resulted in numerous flight cancellations in Germany's main airports.
According to a standard password and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers connected to the airport are no longer numerous, although 400 liters are available there.
Accidents occurred after midnight on many roads.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train to a level pass.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow waves on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit on a level passage because the vehicle was reallocated there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car broke down on a ski lift in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce the good news: The snow will always be soft and soft, but it will turn in case of light raphales.
But the wind will fail.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
However, it makes very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for his Christmas tour.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to the information reported by the newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two offices located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This property could be reported up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank is just about to mount the group's seat: The Christmas Tours in the Business Quarter have been modernized; while waiting, the bankers have to return to their former place of service.
Dorénavant, the financial group openly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two real estates, as stated in the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper, citing a password.
This password did not specify the reasons for the expected sale.
He said "our verifications if it is more interesting to take care of the property or the sale of them, and to relocate them later".
It is also the largest financial institution in Germany that has already left its seat, not long after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the jumbers for an amount of EUR 272 million to the owners of the own funds, and then rehabilitated them.
The energy optimisation transformations included around 200 million euros, according to some indications.
A sale would obviously report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of tours, rebaptised between "All Greens" and around 500 million euros.
According to the portal, we do not know at present whether the property will be resaled to a bank fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people are suffering minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for taught minors who were reported dead following several explosions in a mine.
It was still not possible to rebuild the bodies because the security situation of the sissystrian forces continued to be precipitous.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age were taught under the ground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister power, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the strong concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration had considered that the minors had no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be remounted.
Today, parents and friends have held a celebration at the Memorial of the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sunny sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 learned minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, boxes and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The troops were placed in custody in front of all the country's public buildings.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the memorial festival that New Zealand had eaten the hope that the minors would remount to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was taught in the caves, said he could not be re-signed to accept his son's death until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also learned during the first explosion on 19 November.
Secourists began to spread a fire inside the coal mine of the South of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to decline.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie an artificial film?
The realist Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old generation through his film, "Wahalla Rising", the champion of the fighter.
To which audience is the Danish Realiser Nicolas Winding Reffn well able to think about the "Wahalla Rising" tour?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) does not own only an egg being imprisoned; he frees himself from his belly and, with a almost supernatural force, eliminates his enemies after others. This seems to be ideal for young male spectators seeking a blood-thing action, just because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is in bad mood, he attacks the instincts of his enemies without expecting them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borough says no words on its real name. Even the other characters leave to escape, in addition, beyond one or two sentences, some possible agonist crises.
Otherwise, we say nothing and we celebrate in the beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
This would be more ideal for moderate cinematics with an interest in existenceism and excellent travel.
When a film sees several groups-citizens, it is harmful that they are excluded from each other.
The realist Winding Refn has been considered, since the defeat of "Pusher", his trilogy regarding the drug dealer Faruche and full of style, such as a sort of Danois Quentin Tarantano, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or to introduce a little bit of brutality to the art and trial film.
Most of the sympathetics of the art film must experience the horror facing the brain that spreads around and the intestines.
The lovers of action movies die again, when the village is en route, for reasons that it can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are buried for an eternity of peace and prosperity before the crew arrives in America and continues to take place.
It is not surprising, then, that "Wahalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that there was only under the DVD format.
This is especially due to the magnificent images of the misery that deserve some attention, but also because the image of a film palliping, from time to time, is hidden behind a prestigious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor about a coherent action, it is all an ambiance, a strong dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't escape there.
Reffn gives him a moment of detention and slowly cuts his throat with glazing images and a loud sound band, but especially with an insatiable hate that tears people's hearts.
Only a young blond boy, who is faithful to the village side, maintains a certain innocence, all others are animated by anger.
More than that, the village hero whose mobiles are never known, but who comes from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisional alliances in war, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents permissibility, but perhaps not only for those who are, in any way, perpetrate.
"Wahalla Rising" is an eunygmatic film that we can hate or admire, which has for the end of the attack, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mastering works of terrace
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications of a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
However, this country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less to be subject to agency controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15
It is located on the river of the Euphrates; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name is contained in the IAEA documents, as it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in the parallel pipe of stone, dissimulated in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a United States information service, the CIA, by the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby village, El-Kibar, would be well equipped to produce plutonium, which would enable the production of atomic weapons.
In contrast, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video of presentation containing floating satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the centre that represents a minima copy of the North-Koreen model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the pictures showing the nearby building, see the inside of it.
It seems that the reactor was on duty, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, more information is available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery spread further.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in the Kibar, but had no clues showing that the country had developed " an active nuclear weapon programme".
Some information officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious on this subject and talk only about a "responsible reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation "plumbable".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he had been involved with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the past by claiming that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians had certainly removed the cuts of the "unusual military housing" and had been subjected to a methodical planning of the land.
However, in June 2008, an AIA team of experts led by former inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered man-made uranium traces in the Kimbar.
In addition, the IAEA has received a Member State's satellite images of commercial suppliers showing the moment that followed the attack. It seems that the latter are more exciting than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, Israel, may have acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the components by qualifying for possible investment.
Since then, ladies have rejected any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of the Kibar and refuses access to the roofs of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel kept a secret.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in force at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never comment on this."
The investigation into this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without a result and has become "more and more into a serious credit problem of the Agency", as recognized by a Western High-level diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, which is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of three other facilities that must have "a functional report" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what installations are in place here, what their function is or what they are suspected of being contained.
According to information published in the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj ass-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah as well as the name of nearby cities.
The Washington Institute of Independent Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf, which would probably be one of the suspects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly at its side; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites of the IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it was claimed that the Syrians denied that the inspection group was actually sending spies on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by the U.S. secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles made ships between the three sites and the stone parallepipede to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat stated in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used to produce fuel".
There would be no "indications on sensitive activities", such as the enriching and withdrawal of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with non-rich uranium.
However, there is the strength of positive assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where the uranium should come and where the plutonium needed for the production of the bomb would later be separated.
We do not know if the records, which could be hidden from high value traces, were stored on the three sites.
When hundreds of land-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information about the storage site of the graves.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined the al-Tibni salt mine in 1998, located only a few kilometres from Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can be reached in the storage of radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of photos taken by satellite for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelly established a link between those and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show, however, that Syria has undertaken terrace work on the three suspicious sites and moved from huge containers when IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but this has not contributed to removing the doubts.
It is said in the diplomatic environment that the IAEA has been developing a plan for inspections to be carried out several months ago, which should enable Syria to maintain any military secrets. Only the investment time shows the great interest of inspectors in this matter.
During this time, Damas also made a final decision on this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not done anything about the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the US Ambassador who has been calling for a few months on behalf of the Special Inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to carry out its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future," but he is still afraid.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation to be scaled.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who thinks, "It would be good if they found nothing at all"
Love in Wartime
It's bad since Angelina Jolie made her early years as a realist.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a love story between a woman of Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We know nothing more about this story, but that's enough to cause the curse.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian storm during the war of Yugoslavia.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some of the tournament sequences planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film has turned into Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war addressed Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and requested that she meet the actress.
She's not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but those who chose this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario was quite long about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for the removal of the quality of volunteer Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosniak Ministry of Culture, who received copies of its scenario, gave a tour authorisation to Sarajevo after a few weeks, but we do not know why it was not yet done.
The young author himself ensures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, but that she is making a lot of effort in the wake of the Yugoslavian conflict, and she supports her desire to implement the terrible consequences of the war and to give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains empty on the subject of content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circle on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is also a big difference with the version "a victim of violence loves himself from his chest".
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, as Jolie says, is "unjust and based on misinformation".
Now, only Hollywood fans can seek peace: by illegalizing this scenario in the Net, as well as others before.
Let's get out of here!
This evening, everything goes back to the Irish.
no trace of consternation.
That is why the local team dominates the visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States too.
The fans shout joy at the background of a strong music, they shake their feet.

Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drink game and reserved information, these two behaviors are really not going to be quite together.
Nevertheless, the 26-year-old man is trying to show himself, to turn away from the frightening issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, it will lead the maintenance of the warehouse in New Zealand.
"I try a strange feeling," he said.
"The country is so far away and I have no job."
Finally: He says that he has already waited in Auckland, "at least two, she has expressed her desire to work as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the country's dark prospects, two of Tanner's three sisters tried to escape.
His sister Yvonne, a social assistant, lives in Sydney, her brother Colin is now taking a post as a computer consultant in London.
Young people say: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even planned a number of 200,000 immigrants from here by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are met, this will be a comparable migration rate to which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic booms during which the Irish people enjoyed great relief, the chagrin now takes the whole place.
However, the economic crisis affects particularly the young Irish, well-formed, who have been known to date only for moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
But, in the meantime, three people under the age of 30 are in unemployment.

However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" room that provides comprehensive support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But work abroad is an excellent opportunity for those new in the profession to take the first steps in the stages of the professional hierarchy," he said.

Six months, Sean O'Donovan, he knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was no more work to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A modest house of luck just from land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan only rarely visits his native country, because he participates in an additional job, so that he can complete the credit awarded to build his home in the native country.
"The situation is already a little dengue," he says, breaking the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I get money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't actually see any more."
It bursts out of a garnished river through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept gardens, expensive large brand cars are stationed on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of EUR 380,000, funded by the credit.
"There were moments of follies, no doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything crashing on credit?
O'Donovan reflects a moment, feels hot and says, "I don't have children to enjoy, and I'm young; even if everything goes through, I can go to zero."
The construction engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"No one must suffer hunger, our situation is not even as dramatic as what happened here sometimes in the island," he says.
"Traving for a while abroad, it's not what can happen worse, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then speaks of his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"It was about to come back after seven years and, in Ireland, life just continued."
This idea is good for Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life is going on.
In his palmarise, He has been working in London for a few years. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his wife.
But there is something else that worries you about these last days: the festival to organize at the time of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn around in the morning.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said, bulging a long beer bottle.
"One day, it seems all the same worrying."
"Let's just call it a night to see, all stopped, meeting some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The Democratic Route
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as is the case with the private enterprise.
Crime has become more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the well-being of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries throughout the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, the support for democracy has passed from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy was restored after a severe decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the region's respondents were satisfied with the way democracy of their country was functioning in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (graph 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as in the last two cases; but in a strong increase compared to 2003 (i.e. 17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America forced support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have only experienced short-term recession and have experienced a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin-Americans living in poverty increased slightly in 2009 and again dropped by 32 per cent this year.)
But the humor varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are translated by a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have increased.
This is only for the second time since the poll began more than more respondents throughout Latin America have mentioned crime than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Some 31% say that they or one of their neighbours have been victims of a criminal act during the school year; however, this figure is lower than 38% in the last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for the private enterprise and the market economy: around 71 per cent of the region's respondents say that the private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56 per cent in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% estimate that the market economy is the only system that will make their developing countries, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuela's respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriated by many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest beneficiary in the region, mentioned by 19% of the respondents ( versus 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, adjusted to last year) and Venezuela (9%, 11%, since last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A voicemailed
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country sneeze and spread in fear.
Boxes were presented and a new box was presented, ballots were distributed in the halls, polling offices and intimidations.
The voting offices would be open late at night.
Many of the Haitians, including many who were then transferred to the January session, would have gone to the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them have ended up leaving.
A dozen candidates to the presidential board, including several alleged favourors, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have been launched through the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event to be "a pretty good choice in matters".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have clearly stated that they “did not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, were necessarily invalidating the process”.
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are renegade to René Préval, the tax-free president, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates for the opposition, Michel Martelli, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, an old lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no tangible support for the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tour of the second tour.
With a cholera epidemic that is rare, and more than 1 million survivors in the seismic environment still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be possible.
On the occasion, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250 000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The injection is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of feet towards the centre
The following weeks after becoming so late, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, received a public sympathy burden that improved its 20-point approval rate by more than 50%; this is the highest level since its election in 2007.
However, converting this into a successful campaign for a second mandate during a election next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fernández, apparently disappointed, which she would either abandon or not betray her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nastor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income on their own.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition was divided, and the situation became so bad in the development following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peruvian movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after catholic meetings (when a parliamentarian struck one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue with you," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied the next year, leaving the President a greater margin of work to spend on the will.
The economy is rapidly growing: it is likely to grow by around 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1% but many private estimates and the wage claims of the unions are about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his role in 2003 when Argentina was alarming economic collapse, made a priority in growth and poverty reduction rather than in inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, arrested the private sector, and cleaned up the INDEC, the statistical office, which had been falsifying statistics on official inflation.
Can Mrs Fernández modernise these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit the salary increases next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been stimulated by high global export prices in Argentina.
However, inflation has increased the drop in growth following a strong decline in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández showed signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the obligors who had refused an earlier restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had failed to settle its disputes in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be erecting towards and agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve supervision by the IMF, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which is similar to a prelude to the INDC's recovery.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs support from the middle class, including Kirchnerism, which is very expensive.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacations in Mars, the sympathy wave for her will have flown.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to reject her husband’s many policies.
A half hour for China
The Taiwanese electors are directed towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of her big brother on the other side of the desert?
More than 7.5 million electors were presented on 27 November, or 70 per cent of the eligible persons, to elect municipal mayors and advisers in five urban districts, as a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. But himself has become a substitute for feelings relating to the continent, with new business links, including a free sharing agreement, in the biggest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. I did the test, but it's all right.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five seats, he failed to win most of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which thought of Taiwan's complete independence, won almost 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential poll, it would have been difficult for me.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote fell by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event triggered most of the main themes of Taiwanese elections, including the pick-up truck and mass collection teams with girls who were dancing in minimal detention.
A compulsory mysterious murder attempt has also been made.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate for the election.
A man from the crowd drew on young Mr. Lien, just through the face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Unfortunately, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any event, Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, said that the killing had consequences on the election by leading the DPP suspicion and turning the electors to KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
He was beginning to see how the issue of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates worked with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stopping its links with the Government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refused to act against Chinese feelings.
This is the answer to a new consensus that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, has given a confirmation of whether his Chinese policy was acceptable for the majority of Taiwanese people.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in line with its strategy to return to Taiwan.
China has not lost any time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration; but it begins with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP is in any way reinvented.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison after charges of corruption.
The President, from 2000 to 2008, was a procurator for an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has seen the day under the direction of Ms. Tsai and the PDP are working to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate to the presidency, such as His Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their part is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their stakeholders could have a position without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party was presenting an "alternative reputation of trust" in relation to the alleged approach of Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems desperate for this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have obtained better results if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to interfere with the presidency.
Even without Mr Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a bad choice among its potential candidates.
KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite a genuine economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its incompatibility seems to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his cabinet and his local antennas will be removed.
The good results of the PDP suggested that Taiwan's support for the approach should be limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanis see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an editorialist, "the point of not returning is already gone."
Names in Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a chosen surprise in the category "best new artist"
Make a president's request, and people need to know him.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was handy by President Obama to be produced at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, noted one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a big surprise appointment in the category of "the newest artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains a little mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not produce more than three albums before the registration; which "determinates the public identity of this artist."
Its 2010 ambitious album, "Chamber Music Society", has certainly marked a step forward and, given its mildly challenging voice style, its popular pop and fun and its Latin influence, it is possible to draw at least one scored line in Spalding in relation to the success highlighted by Norah Jones in 2003, which is the closest match for Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards electors have just been entitled "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio in the " instrumental album" category, a virus on a revulsion that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Among these yesterday, "Moody 4B" of the veterant James Moody and "Positotly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will be particularly competitive.
Thrombone Shorty, in favour of the Russian voice of the New Orleans and often invited to HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which is also strongly attached to a certain merger with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Society's secret of the wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has gained some merit in the big group; in competition with the wealth-jazz room of Billy Children Together and the adventure star Dave Holland whose album "Paths" of his 8th live was an excellent example of the democratic hand of this bassist as head of the group.
Name of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey run in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards each year include a mixture of musical landscapes and composers from around the world.
In the heads of nominations, Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machine" quotes, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among those who have connections with South California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the Los Angeles-based composer, Avner Dorman, is also in line for a reward.
The classic designations are reflected in 13 categories covering registrations of orchestras, operas, corals and solos.
A category for the classic producer of the year is five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The names for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacificium - the art of Castrati" by various artists; and the "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the Opera category, the names are "Lulu" by Berg de l'Orchestra du Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Love of Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Heart of the Marysky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition count Pärt for the Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatto More", Magnus Lindberg for "Graphiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 was first held at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution registered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-magazine of Michael Khodorkovski, who was imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was named for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he had just written the 15-minute work for the interview on the commandline Avi Avital, who played the concert with Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a large number of North Africa's games and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old Orchestra leader Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the Orchestra performance category for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only so-called soloist vocalists: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, Soprano Jessee Norman received a nomination for his registration "Racines: my life, my song"
The project of the Temécula mosque succeeds the approval of the planning committee.
A project of mosque in Temcula received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witness, often passionate.
The criticisms were made on the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and trafficking embassies.
However, the Commissioners held Wednesday evening that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be impressive.
"Many people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temécula Valley, taking the word Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of you as American citizens."
"It shows that justice brings it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18 hours and lasted for almost a minute with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at the time of almost also divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There's no more America," wrote an interviewer.
"It's about another single planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also triggered protests in other parts of the country, including the Zero Ground, where attacks took place on 11 September 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmous condemned violence in Temécula Valley.
Its congregation of 135 families is co-existing without incident in the Riverside county for years, but it wanted a greater and better space than the one it commended on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 feet in the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two minettes and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4,32 hectares on Nicolas Road about two miles east of the Chaparral Lake.
Opposers can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A toleranceal microbe raises the possibility of new life types on Earth, or otherwise.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorous or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really "foreign" life form," said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphate and sulfur.
But researchers have found that bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing the arsenic phosphorus.
"We are asked what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, generated speculations on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the whole "standard" of the elements that we consider absolutely necessary for life could not be established," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Science, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Symon of NASA's Institute of Astrophysics, who conducted the study, chose the Mono lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and phosphoric are chemically similar; thus, it specified that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of the phosphorous."
"As a result, organisms have a bad choice of these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is quite different so it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorous; it's stuck inside and, somehow, the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the known bacteria called GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorous but the fact that it can live with the arsenic at the site raises the possibility that a life form using the arsenic can be produced naturally either on Earth or on another planet or on the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant microbiology professor at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorus, was not new; but there was no indication that it could go.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of Earth, she said; thus researchers showed the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to shape life, not just the way life on Earth was originally formed," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Symon's research team.
Research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton.
The two other exhibition dogs on four flights from the outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the chiefs of the Los Angeles county announced it Thursday.
The four exposure dogs - two acutes and two pellets of pembroke gallois - disappeared Tuesday when someone flew the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, the authorities announced.
Two dogs were recovered after noon, and the other two were found at the end of the Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesman of the department of the sheriff of the Los Angeles county.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were restored to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs had been found, in which neighborhood and what circumstances were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a commentary on Thursday.
They met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for animals from the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old man, and Didi, a 10-month-old woman - were healthy and healthy, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the fears that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, for the Japanese dog owners, were destroyed until their Wednesday night discovery.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend in the framework of the National "AKC/Eukanuba" champion of Long Beach, where they were about to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other trials scheduled in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek said at Times Wednesday.
South California is one of the arrests of the Canine Exhibition Tour almost a month from the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and win their truck outside, just outside the window of their room.
They drove three other dogs - a shut boxer, a patriot Parson Russell and a bottle - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Atakis and the courage, to provide it with more space, in the truck, where it would be more expensive.
They have a little open windows, so dogs can have air free.
Peek and Rickard reported the flight from the truck at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Peek said they would give a reward to anyone who could drive them to the chests, with a micropouse installed to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted to Jews.
The lion is ready to rediscover again, the restructuring of MGM is no longer waiting for the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained green fire to begin with zero.
A federal judge of New York's failure officially praised the "prepaid" plan by the creditors, which said about $5 billion of debt would be deleted; opening the way to the entertainment company, 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan met the requirements of the United States failure code, no legal obstacle existed in front of the MGM in order to be subjected to the supervision of the Founders of Entertainment Spyglas, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become general directors of what will be an alleged study.
Staff will be collected to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase does not conclude a $500 million credit facility intended to finance new MGM operations and production.
It is currently distributed under a licence by the investment bank, which is worth $75 million, and should be financed until mid-December.
The study restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank was engaged to advise on how to finance it, since it did not have the means to pay the interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Director-General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an old Enron's PDG and an expert in rehabilitation for his work at Krispy Krme Dughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 students of the study took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to sell the company at the end of 2009.
However, the sale of deposits attracted a small number of bidders among whom none of them were willing to pay the amount of 2 billion more than the creditors were seeking.
At the beginning of this year, there was a need to be re-examined when the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disputes and discussions, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially fails in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have collected $375 000 per month for their business management services, will receive a profit of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are about to relaunch the production of MGM, which has come out only one film this year, and to put on a list of seven or eight films that will come out of 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The study must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investigator Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not been concluded.
Tech Games to keep your budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful game is the IPAD, follow, perhaps, through Microsoft, Kinect's video game system, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX vehicles at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 bars to rent classic pearls, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national game sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Moore Law has evolved, the technology game of this year is likely to have more strength; however, the same price is slightly lower, compared to the last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new games associated with web sites, two of the most known types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button games are on increase, as well as the game on rechargeable piles.
Here's some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are games in the size of an Indian cocoon that sings a note when you hold them on your belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows a song to be composed.
If you buy more, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animated poppy plays role games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance with its innovative articulated feet with the blockade of wheels.
Children who have attempted the game use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational games.
It's coming back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a bag full of two game cards designed to convert a car ball into a session with auto-correction and a class of vans.
If you are upset when your child has your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for the 3-8 years) is the least expensive and easy to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games are not as effective as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for the 3-12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leopster range, with a more recent and more bright screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price ($90, for 3-7 years) uses a iTunes-type system to provide electronic games and books and has an SD card entry that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a collection of five-blocks with more than one aluminum box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time comes to school, it is ideal for an improvised orchestra competition.
In addition, games have a kind of online connection.
Based on their presence in the game stores, the two largest are Wekkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a online company animal from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for the 6-12 years) that includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child gets enough credit in the Club Penguin store for two items in the selection.
It can be done by wheelchairs or by a company animal playing Puffle.
Smaller than your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last microbots on the button.
The falsified animal quickly moves on 12 pieces in vibrating silicone in alleate directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
She's strong too.
Our apartment has survived a fall in the kitchen table and even a temporary passage in the corner of our dog.
Bring a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin rented a place in the city as a urban officer for training by severely inspecting his nervous burdens, by issuing low-vote orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of the Chengguan - responsible for public order in China, feared and imprisoned for their arbitrary repression and thought of violence - to transmit a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"You have the right!"
"Be pacifists!"
Show them, say, "What do the beautiful girls look like!"
Four girls in pain who had passed the adolescence in white gloves, clothes and identical olive-coloured clothes, were on your guard.
Four pairs of black-and-white shoes, coupled to the rule.
Four perfectly healed hats are attached to the sum of hair attached by a blue and white-red needle.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with shame.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of the city inspectors in China.
A city required all new recruits to have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has changed the grey-vert of uniforms against a more demanding blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with the strength of: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had attempted an uncontrollable snack chariot by launching black reviews, firmly for half an hour, until the co-rapporteur repacks his business and part.
Xindu, a urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to perform a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, their beards and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a lower side, more female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johannsson could have difficulty attracting attention to this underground urban brigade of China
And for that reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
The Chinese media, however, challenge the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed an observer after using his mobile phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste disposal.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin's inspectors, discussed and put in line, describes how the offenders are effectively winning without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastor was abandoned with a brain injury after a cigarette with five officers.
A popular video game of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in street sales.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication last year, after a Polish poll on tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "true complete cleaning."
Sceptics say the approach is far away.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, asked whether women had real jobs or whether they were just a tourist fun.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates aged between 18 and 22 years to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five treatises of the face in good order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 21⁄2 inches.
Retirement by 26 years is mandatory.
Officials stated that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a almost-governmental website.
"First, the external quality of candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; this is the size, weight, face-to-face trade, etc."
Then came the weather and "inland quality."
The women of the Chengguan are like flowers, he said, "More than bees, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not agree with this description.
However, he noted that the higher requirements were the standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relating to the order of the trades in the face.
That this good meaning is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities must not postulate.
"We can't leave a person who's tired or a boss coming to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang site near a monastery, is 22 years old and has played the games with a finally inflated mouth.
She does not consider it to be worth her appearance as a sexist, she says.
"Do you think I've had sex in this uniform?" she asked for an air outlet.
Xu Yang, his colleague at 21 years of age, says: "Our job is to present the city's image."
They are not opposed to their limited mandate, they say, because they feed more career ambitions than simply throw sellers into the streets where they are willing to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen ambulances moving fast to foot or bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu balls as possible before taking the flight.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu, while a salesman walked on foot, temporarily leaving his bicycle-charte on the ground.
The agents describe their functions rather than monotonous.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of sellers.
They can only threaten to signal opponents to their superior men.
This tends to protect them from Sudanese public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after spreading false rumors that the agents of the Chengguan had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police officers and agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were turned or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace is not a guarantee.
Just two beds of houses in the place Baoguang, where women's sex officers were patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the truck rather than in a store, as they imposed regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was building the scandal.
A 15-minute train followed before the police, on the left-hand side, broke down a narrow road to their vehicle and were able to get along at any speed with the motor and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remains behind, his white bath returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, 40 - year - olds or more - old coordinators play a role in supporting themselves.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a clear image.
"Sometimes, we fight literally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," said Mr. He came out of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving an assistant from an old campaign and his efforts to get a job of lobbying for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday to the senator's lawyers.
The decision resulted in the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered to be a possible Republican candidate to the President of 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case did not take place in the last year and spread to his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, resulting from a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate's ethics committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of maintaining any charge against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has not commented on the matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise for many foreign ethics lawyers in the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have intended to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to obtain a job of lucrative lobbying to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's business with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political fundholders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they engaged Mr. Hampton to make a lobbying for them, in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a co-rapporteur of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by the Law to make the lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems contrary to the prohibition of the round door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie evidence of a set of acts of violence and substantial violation of the law of the turning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients of a government investigation.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reason for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Department seemed to be anti-political after a number of high-level reviews by its section of public integrity, including the last year's decision to abandon the prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of a continuing failure.
The federal prosecutors were clearly afraid to take up arms, Melanie Sloan, the general direction of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the following day, saying that the Department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed him in a communiqué, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the park.
"I am not about to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents violated the federal electoral law in Hampton.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find the job of lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after accepting Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that the Ministry of the Interior was "martial" on a dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton to make the lobbying.
When the news of the case came up last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his electors and resigned from his position as leader at the fourth republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to fulfil a third mandate in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice quickly and end the investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call pointer to Twitter
One and a half of them were on their way to the audience hall's ranks.
They sent all minute reports of terrible witnesses via Twitter.
Finally, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the crime process and children attached to their beds in a house that had been burned.
Thursday, the widely followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should be conducted on an official basis where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already deposited elements in the court that challenge the arguments of appeal, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing this is that the intention of reporting on the process - as well as the generalized and widespread use of Twitter journalists - has created a " atmosphere of the circle " , a saturin so relaxed and instantaneous with the fire details that the jury has been adversely influenced by the public's passions.
The request could lead judges to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms affects the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, counseled by Mr. Hayes, counseled chief.
The judge of the trial, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of State, rejected the claims in the trial last week, asserting that the media were "fully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been encouraged by the trial.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The appeal courses have recognized for decades that media coverage of note-to-case cases can raise questions about the equity of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States cancelled the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopathy, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was a " carnival atmosphere in the process " due to the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television and the film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts had arrived to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later, with the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of hearing rooms, which were inimaginable in the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report according to which she was arbitraryly applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from hearing rooms could allow more fair proceedings.
Twitter's case is only one of many others described by Mr Hayes' lawyers, who may have been discussed for years; this is what slows the execution.
The defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered a loss when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the responses of the potential jury by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the trial.
Some of the jury said they had been threatened by the victims' photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Advocates of defence claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and will claim that the judge has unjustly excavated one of the jury, which was critical to the prosecutors, and that he has abused the pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual decision to remove the jury in a week-end.
The jury wasn't secreted.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the process could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, which was filed last month, that the case was dominated by the media scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates at the government post and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the media did not cease to act on the flame of the emotion of the case.
"The daily tweets of media, cameras and journalists in front of the justice court," the lawyers wrote, "they did not look like anything that had been seen here before in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the claim that the new instantaneous people were more infamous than the media were slowing down was a ludicrous view that would cover the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courses were often drawn by arguments that required the adaptation of the courts to social and technological changes.
Mr Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and explained that they would need new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, representing Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization draw closer to the clivas?
After a campaign marked by investment and negation, a minimum of civilization spread to Washington this week.
Is this a sign of a true bipartite cooperation to the front or an illusory moment before the quick return to the partial struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress has not produced any insight into the major issues that must be dealt with during the "bottle canard" session.
However, there was at least a pool discussion on the differences between the two parties as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points. empty points.
The President's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political discrepancy between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect by transcending the ideological fabric; however, it still divides the members.
It is painful enough to declare that a new age of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of testing and mutual testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electors for a renewed partial war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has occurred in the last two years.
As regards taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, the two parties remain thousands of distances.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now outside the Ethical and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections result in partial passions and then they stop.
That's good."
On certain issues, especially those on the agenda of the "bottle canard" session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a party or the whole, in a permanent or temporary way.
Similarly, a compromise is visible on the extension of unemployment allowances, since the Republicans cannot give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimal plan on a possible agreement on issues raised during the "bottle canard" session, with the ratification of the New START Agreement.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institute, warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lamine duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th convention will meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely to be inevitable.
"When things that have to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism, which would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a preview or a shadow-boxing for the 2012 main event, he says.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be at the top of their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partial positions are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the Committee on Debt, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, restoring retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, have imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had to reach this number.
The largest resistance exists among the group's elections; this suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston has two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first year will come in the form of joint confrontations, given that the Republicans are opposed to Obama's budget, taxes and health care; then it will be followed by a longer period of greater cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the prevailing spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to an outbreak, as in 1995, the two parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The person who will be judged for loss will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But it would still be a point of optimism.
The spirit of partnership and polarization is greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it seems that there is a greater ideological difference between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, both parties were seen as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civility expressed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort on both sides to find an understanding field on the issues that still divide them.
US-discovered documents describe Moscow as a barrier to corruption
The control of the city is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes Kremlin part of the protection money it collects, the US embassy in Russia reported in a February note.
The Federal Security Police and Service perform huge rockets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also organized criminal groups.
Each cup of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putine called the "vertical power" - takes his part while the money goes up to the top of the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been exhausted.
It was edited while Youri Loujkov was still the capital of Moscow; he was largely responsible for corruption.
It was cancelled in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there have been few cleaning traces since.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a first-rate construction company, have always filed corruption charges over the years; and he has received several cases of fraud on these charges.
In September, he said what happened to a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's hunting, it's anything."
The Russians believe, at an alarming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a embassy account; and it is unusual to imagine that this would be to foreign diplomats.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime led some people to call "disfunctional" and to claim that the government was more functioning as a kleptocratic than a government", according to the ambassador's note.
" Criminal elements play a " krysa " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " toit " or protection) through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militias are at second level."
"At last, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups carry a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is expanding the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "it was explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to have the protection of MVD and FSB (except organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by the law."
"That is why the request for protection by criminal gangs is no longer high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be ineffective; even those who suffer may be subjected to arrest.
Those who do not suffer quickly see their business close under one or more of the conditions.
Medvedev has repeatedly mentioned the fight against corruption, but he has made little progress.
The ambassador's note transmits accounts from people who bring currencies, probably full of money, to Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev relied on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank India".
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"He's not part of a political class because he doesn't exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of power, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption would rise to over $300 billion per year throughout Russia.
The country was classified 154e in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified as least corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. ambassador's note, which had only been made yesterday, late in the evening, hours of Moscow, will definitely reimburse the satisfaction of the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blocked, in some way for Moscow's checks, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin expressed the suspicion that WikiLeaks' documents could be a production and reacted in anger to the fact that U.S. diplomats had declared Batman and approached Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem lies in our interaction, an important factor of internal policy in this country, says.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be achieved with such pride, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The old fighters of the Red Khmer forced to face the past
In a bad class room with damaged concrete walls of bad quality, the director of Anlong Veng's secondary school called on the man who built it, the last leader of the Red Khmer, Ta Mok.
"All the world here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he was concerned about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
It is known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when it was at the head of the Red Khmer people, that commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of the ancient Khmer Red in the north-west of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of ancient soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmer were returned to the government, the long-term stay was finally due to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled victims to meet publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmer children of its former soldiers.
In July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, declared its first sentence on an old member of the Red Khmer, condemning, at 35 years of imprisonment, the former chief of the famous torture center of Tuol Sling, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of this change, anxiety has increased with the former fighters of the Red Khmer in Anlong Veng; it is difficult to re-enter Cambodia's community in reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reenter.
"There are feelings and fear among the old Khmer Reds, but they are forced to do whatever it is," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The gender situation of divisions within families."
Under the Khmer Red Cross regime in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died from hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and reversed the Government of Paul Pot-United States in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army were on the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched a surprise that lasted until the last movement took place in December 1998.
While Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerilla of their base located in the mountains of West Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of red Khmer fighters began to undermine the government, culminating in the capitalizations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 waiting for his trial.
Without their beneficiaries, most of the old red Khmer combatants have dreamed of black famine, common in Cambodia's rural regions; many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some red-himmer officials have kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for the placing of weapons, they are not qualified farmers in the low grade and directory.
"These people received very little follow-up after capturing," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation that organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
On Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before being installed as a poor rice grower in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"Tak Mok eats all over the world."
But now life is difficult because we must meet our own needs."
The Khmer Red Court is also involved in this concern.
The court should, at the beginning of the next year, initiate the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer Minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and principal perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say whether he continued beyond these four cases.
It would need more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Red Khmer in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma barrier, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a storm evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a road out of Anlong Veng.
While the sun had long shadowed over the fallen grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the red Khmer.
If the court tried to convince her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodge is peaceful and stable," she said.
"If there's more to go on, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who failed the Red Khmer in 1978, also warned several times that instability would occur if the court continued to hold several suspects; although experts and historians would answer that.
"Cambodge has to cross a hole and bury the past, he says.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in terms of khmer is to recognize broken bones, he says.
"We have to put these babies together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmer, "A History of the Democratic Campus, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the Department of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmer.
As in most Cambodia, young Anlong Veng knows only a few details about the red Khmer, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, studying at Anlong Veng high school, said that the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned home with the book to study.
"My family refuses many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are angry because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the process of complex and difficult reconciliation, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he says.
However, the red Khmer preserves a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a road, covered by the bad trees and covered with plastic bags, leads to a black swirl, covered with a red towel.
Paul Pot's body was burned here on a pneus pill after his death in 1998.
Num Sothea, aged 31, a mobile salesman on the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many of the people will pray there," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later this day, she planned to go to the last place of Paul Pot's rest where she would leave a bunch of walled bananas in hopes of bringing the chance.
Belarus agrees to withdraw from its military-quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its high-rich uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is included in the victory victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide.
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, in the form of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus to give up uranium highly rich for years and seemed to have dropped the horizon in recent spring.
But American officials told Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 books from the military quality uranium from a Biélorus research centre.
This opened the way to a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 books, according to a staff member who announced the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
It appears that it was beneficial to seek an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really impressed by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Lugono, president of the World Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton qualified the "very significant, important stage" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all the vulnerable nuclear materials across the world in the next four years.
Since then, the American Government has helped six countries to get rid of all their rich uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the U.S. Nuclear Security Summit in Obama, the Belarusian President, Alexandre Loukachenko, stated that the nation would never renegotiate to its uranium.
"We have kept the uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the uranium of military quality and the uranium of low-rich," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product ... We won't make salt bombs, and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research, that's all."
Belarus has approached the United States a few months ago, however, expressing its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly disintegrated, the respondents indicated.
It was loaded on a special train that carried more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stocked and removed, the officials indicated.
The second operation was completed Monday and carried out by aircraft, according to those responsible.
The U.S. Government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with the low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A minute coordination and organization has been implemented to strengthen confidence", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a member of the Department of Energy Specialized in the World Health Reduction.
According to the estimates of the Non-Proliferation Study Centre James Martin, Belarus had at least 88 military-quality uranium books this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of uranium highly enriched.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been held for years, mainly due to the severe repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But the statement of Wednesday would suggest a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has issued no objection to the CIA flights
The Government has issued no objection to the flights from the CIA with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo via the Spanish territory, according to a United States ambassador's telegram in Madrid.
This was demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks daily El Country, which added that the first vice-president of the Government of the same time, María Teresa Fernández of Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed "may prove that they were properly monitoring foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe which accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "was surprised by the Government of Zapatero outside-jeu" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From Vega, he stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights from above the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" in order to avoid "take them down," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the day, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence".
In his turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he should not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal element, no sensitive information," explained Ambassador after speaking to the prosecutor.
The United States has also expressed its concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the information issued by the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will make our efforts to manage the case secretly between Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch break between the United States Ambassador and the Minister of the Internet, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba commented that "even if the Spanish judges are completely jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his colleagues "to avoid comments from a flooded rhetoric, trying to reduce temperature".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the action of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general orientation in the United States, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take part in any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The patricide that passed on to the sheep complained on the "accapable" network of being a mother.
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Treaty at the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two origins of Noia, the village of Coruña, where she was the original.
The messages are due from 2008.
To understand them, you need to know your emotional life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimony of its parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrial.
Their relationship lasted for a year.
After they were separated, we learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him test DNA.
We found another new little friend shortly after that.
He was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring town.
With him, she's been with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to visit the labour market, the child stayed with her partner, who accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their ideals were broken, they were separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque alone, and she wrote: "Alberto is very strange and mature because I have come to work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but of course, he now pays attention to what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains, "If this doesn't please him, let him go with my mother, and I'll take her when I get in," she says.
In May, she said of her return to her village: "I'm going to go this week, but I'll only be there until 19, because I have to get 20 to a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her ass with her.
"He will remain with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with another person if this person is not my mother," suspicious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another place.
When she hit him, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on 1 of that month, was supposed to be murdered on the 10th.
"Cessar is happy on one side, but he's not on the other."
"He's with me on one side, and this place pleases him a little, but another one goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorque.
"He's angry (the child) for a few hours in the summer, and like this, I'm saving some money from the baby-sitter."
The 17th meeting of the Conference and the Appeals Committee.
"A very big kiss on Caesar's side, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you to the e-mail I don't know what videos you see, when he wants to, he finds me, damn it."
The 30th, another: "The child's fine, he's going to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, I'm a current partner, there's one, "I'm ahead of the money."
It has messages on the Internet in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had a seat in the universe MySpace, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Treaty of the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, watch out, confess his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything was past because she didn't tell him she was a celibate mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, from the centre of juvenile justice.
The attorney of the office, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she had no intention of doing harm to the minor anymore."
Before she had agreed to kiss Caesar in the bathroom and put her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
The members of the People's Party would receive 4 seats in Congress and the PSC at a loss of 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase in votes and votes recorded in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PPP has already referred to the generals because, whether progress has been made or not, the prospects are more positive than the number of votes in these two committees usually receive in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in favour to the 2008 Generals, while the 2006 autonomouss received 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this trend is maintained, with a result of a shift in the votes of the PSC and the confidence of the PPP electorate, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could have passed from 8 to 12 members of the Congress, while CIU would have won four (he now has 10) and PSC would have lost at least 9 members (he had 25).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, CRC would lose a member - he has three now - while ICV would keep a member or win one.
However, if the electoral agenda is maintained, you will have the next meeting in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the population can also be determined at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relations with the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree that PSC could lose the walls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would no longer have the opportunity to appeal to their traditional partners, CRC and ICV.
In view of the Republican departure, it would not be fantastic for this training to lose its representation in the Barcelona Maryry - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be victims of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PPP before the current socialist mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes in relation to PSC, including the mayor, Angel Ross, maintaining a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they were found several times.
The population also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PPP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and hopes to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a Jewish cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of Bombay's attacks that resulted in 106 people died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that "the Kampai operation" has "deficiency" the international falsification device of Al Qaida and therefore its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, during the two years in which it was active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they have been faked and distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The demanded cell is not the only one that has been operational in Europe, because the research involved, in addition to the Thai services, of other European police units, that is why there could be the following days of similar cuts to those recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona in the territory of the European Union.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Yunaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Aguambiade), another was held in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikallaya Kybumrung.
They were those who had been leading the cells that had been established in Spain and other European countries since Bangkok.
The catalan network - which was hit in 2009 - mainly by tourists, carried passports that met the conditions marked by the World Islamic Front.
It is said that documents should be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Researchers point out that so far there has been no detail that connects prisoners in Catalonia with Bombay's alert, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the recipient groups of passports flying in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia sent it to a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the "command" team that killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend tax complexity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose his circumstances to Artur Mass to support his investment as President of the Generality, identical to those exposed during the campaign and who are able to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-Soverian adventures as the economic complexity that the nationalist leader wishes to address half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People has arrived at your meeting with Artur Mas with the security that resulted in 18 members of the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to please, as the candidate for CIU needs at least one of the trainings that will take the opposition to vote for the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the time being, the conversations that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, in order to support an investment "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereign and independent talks", and the economic complexity - similar to that of the Basque country - which the leader wants even to submit to the referendum.
The two leaders have jointly paid their money to host the political apparatus of an extremely high autonomous administration and to eliminate taxes applied to succession and donations.
Details of Mas investment negotiations will be taken up on PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The geriatrics claim that the dead have not been subjected to "a lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot Center do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurses killed more than 11 people.
The government officials in La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) delivered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 people who were responsible for the period he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the counsel of the centre, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead, but "the legality and responsibility require us to assume the procedural situation of civil servants".
In addition to the social disclaimer that the entity may suffer in order not to detect in time the criminal activities of night nurses, the great threat for the Caritat is now taking the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé claimed that the first crime occurred in August 2009 and that since that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the judgment that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients in the hospital - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally investigate the disappearances, but, given the age and pathology of the patients, formality was on the phone.
The Caritat, through its director, said this situation almost yesterday and said that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of the perjury of any other person who is accused of it."
The person who was already baptized as the "Ange of Death" committed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and one month later killed a second mother.
In this case he caused his death by injecting an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the complexity of controlling access to medical personnel from the centre.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the suffering of the insides, used to kill them.
But laboratory analysis will clarify whether Vila does not believe that he has sought for his first victims a less cruel death or rather burned them inside by giving them lessive as he has already agreed to do with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurses, no more the number of alleged murders, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number would be greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing how to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they said that they would remain available for justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
BCE threat
Investors reacted violently yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The differences in the periphery have been closed to power and European banks' actions have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must no longer underestimate the ECB's ability to reverse and the euro has registered an increase, which is an interesting signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short positions and very speculative closures.
The institutional investor will be late to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB has called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to be withdrawn tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its ineffectiveness and the elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures at the end and leaving only unlimited weekly access.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will maintain the sale of unlimited access to quarterly entrants at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by the end of June.
We hope that we will continue with the obligation purchase programme and give it even the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of yesterday's markets and continue to be alert to withdrawing the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of obligations and had broken the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Last year in Portugal, the number of treaties was very poor.
The Tresor issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous loan.
Even so, the types in Portugal have reduced 30 basic points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market feeling after Trichet's words.
The figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in short term and 15,000 potentials and have a period up to February for private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having identified the problem in July with the stress test, figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a pit of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel measured the tone of his speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are united and that we interpret all the same party.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficits, liberalization, privatization, measures to re-activise employment include investment hearings such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explain the fact that the Spanish Bourgeois has risen to 4.5%, the second of the remaining European Bourgeoises.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today, there is a key to a three-year commitment that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong demand and help to raise doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a Plan of Assistance would be an autoimmune.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Tresor has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, the March trip, to very expensive types and they cut access to the markets daily.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's husband, "on the other hand, the look."
Courage, we can go out!
The President of Eulen will answer Vega Sicilia's advice requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will answer, as he considers it "no law", the judge of El Enebro's next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to claim their majority and represent bodies of management of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia firm.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesus David and María José, provide their legal battery for the new chapter of their struggle for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the larger maintenance of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in El Enebro's governing bodies.
From its board of directors, he was excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators in the meeting of the shareholders of 18 January this year, whose reply was recorded in the Register of Trade and Companies.
The Justice Council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the Toners box within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to set up the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism to ensure that the assembly is convened.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Martha and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "exploratory appeal of the applicants' five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly breaking the Law and by violating the law, to validate and correct the Assembly radically on 18 January", according to his official oral notes.
This argument will be the basis for the assembly to be challenged once it is considered to be "not fully entitled".
The same protagonists, who maintain silence, have already tried without success that the masterate has convened an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a parent and titler company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among others, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group requested 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the fundamental question that the judge must decide after hearing the request for an answer for which he has not yet reported.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this universal speed selection has been marked by surprise and success.
At the first time, no one had taken into account the options of a new strike that had to come, despite the rising trajectory of the last season, last November, in the last phase of the campaign they all compared to Ferrari's triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as a champion pilot, the German Sebastien Vette, no longer the power of the Renault engine that offers his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives of the high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly chains of the world's manufacturing tools, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before it is built in a real way, thus avoiding the inevitable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's photo equipment, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer tool in Formula 1 has enabled Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the courses and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 cycles had an average of 10 technicians in their teams capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 high-quality professionals are working today, which, teams of powerful computer equipment analyse and design all kinds of changes on the balls.
Siemens' director explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull's balls except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can take place from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this model of technological perfection there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as limited as each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech tool to create and produce its bubbles in a location 50 km from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
All that's going on there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty includes 580 persons, including two pilots, Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull is certainly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has contributed to its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is inexhaustible and no notoriety.
The vehicle technology director Steve Nevey said that five years ago we could claim that R+D's progress in the case of race cars brought 50% of the winners and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85 per cent of success, while pilots bring 15 per cent of the added value.
Nevey argues that Vettels or Webber will never be replaced by information, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the refurbishment store located on the Grand Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she worked 30 years ago.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third of Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible magazines, even if she had found that Madrid could be the next destination.
HM's management of personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with sectoral experience and knowledge.
The North American Group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected interactively), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of institution staff.
Helena Herrero noted that it is a French system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-market and even packaging".
The Barcelona magazine includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that solves possible problems of the computer equipment of HP in guarantee.
A online service connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"Yes, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already engaged in technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell has a million customers on its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, there is an increase in interest margins, which we will try to compensate in part with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sababell hopes to capture a million individual customers in three years, his task to do.
Sababell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complex economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to win a market share by the capture of a million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank - its great task is to do so, as so far this bank has been more expensive to SMEs and companies than the private customer.
This year he acquired 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5 per cent, while it exceeds 10 per cent of the companies.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the pari on productivity, or the same thing, austerity, with the reduction of costs as a target, which will be explained by the bank when it submits the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now able to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has reduced all plans of the world banking sector.
Sababell will, in fact, conclude this year's plan of Director Optima, which he established four years ago, even though the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further period.
Customers who let out the savings caches will be their main target.
During a small day organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "hard and cross-continental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will "be slow".
In addition, in two or three years this will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he stressed.
And even if he believes that the passive war - which criminalizes the margins - decreases, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity is already transferred to the credit price to compensate for the loss of the margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't close the robinnet, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also noted that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sababell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "we will seek greater dimensions."
"All will move next year," he said.
He argues that capital needs are "greatly increasing" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
It also points out that the FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sababell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it reduced the importance of some banks already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but on the contrary of what happened in June, it can be obtained from short-term funding through rest, which awaits the crisis.
ECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new vacuum of shells mergers and stressed the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings caches began, several entities made sure that they were not to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director-General of the Spanish Caisses d'Epargnes (ECA), rejected the possibility of producing this new vacuum of operations yesterday.
"I think that most of the mergers have been achieved, we cannot say that the integration of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, that's adjustments."
"Most have been fully implemented; it is possible that instead of being 17 to 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, which has worked very much in this operation," the manager stressed.
In statements during a small day of the Aragón Directors and Executives Association (ADEA), Olavavarieta stated that the concentration process is "as soon as possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it has been achieved in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he said.
"The passage of 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million volumes of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unprecedented process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Bále," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of very few happy opinions on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "that the Bank of Spain has made it clear that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The head of the ECCA, José Antonio Olavaririeta, assured yesterday that Spain had the most severe financial system of all Europe and the "probably" of the world, and he attributed it to those who doubt it to a "inconsistencies of knowledge".
The manager mentioned that given the current economic conjuncture, "we can stay very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings caches, a system that started a "very important" concentration process and "go as fast as possible".
It also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well affected by the stress tests made by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has established conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adaptation methods, which range from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of EUR 426 without professional contributions to the privatization of 49% of AENA, airport management of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Philipe González, joined with Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to address the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which surprises it to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany it is started to focus on the three possible exits of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by it, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
Second, Mark's recovery, even though now it seems to science fiction, with a very favourable opinion current, is almost 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a new concept of the euro, in line with Germany's proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigidity, amendments to the countries that are in breach of them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government launched a constitutional reform to prevent them from coming up in 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (the fiscal stability and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second time of the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then, it has been the object of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and public opinion were opposed to Greece's withdrawal.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to enable a country to withdraw and at the same time require private employers to support a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, as it predicted the Irish crisis and the rest.
However, its proposal, although slightly educated, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should assist in the reform process of the Union, which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she doesn't think she's going to cross.
And she told us that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot be too agreed, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be obliged to cease payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strong growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumer moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with enormous losses in the balance of payments, such as the one who presided over the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will not simply be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad not to hear him.
This is not just about reducing public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current disturbances will bring us greater peace.
And we know that we have been given the opportunity until the spring of 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have also heard of this form and his dual statement (the proposed reforms after the meeting of the previous Saturday with the big companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggested that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the road was opened to the issue of ordering the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, it cannot be excluded from leaving a highly-fashioned monetary area of a few countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sports and fraud of the law
The Russians similar to Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show engineering but not the desire to escape a penalty.
In principle, the expulsion by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match on 23 November against Ajax in the League of Champions made a lot of emphasis on the anti-sportic character of such behavior and whether both players should be punished by the U.S.A.
As we know, just a few minutes before the match (which their team had already won) the two players deliberately lost their time when they made mistakes to determine whether to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and seeing that Real Madrid will be the leader of his group, the two players will perform the regular penalty during the next match of the battle against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards at the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplining Committee sentenced the team trainer, José Mourinho, and various economic costs to the players involved.
The promotion of a yellow cardboard in circumstances like that or similar is not a new practice, but rather more frequent in the football world.
She is so concerned that she is part of the Ethos, non-written rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the debate in the related case must be that this has been a protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its hymme appears to be the nobility and honour and which, in the past, has condemned its players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds a more episode to his history of Histrian and Prostocratic Techniques.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicting the principles of sport, i.e. if there is a violation of the law, because they are, in fact, actions that are relevant to the sport regulation, but appear to be exaggerating its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of injury they cause to the sport spirit.
One of the things that the sport spirit understands is the physical integrity of the opponents, a aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of these assets, which is allusioned with the right game, is to avoid that the criminal player team benefits in an unfair way from the opposite team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players in the Real Madrid is that it does not agree that it is normally characterised as a violation of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has been precisely trying to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty.
They waited and accepted the penalty voluntarily.
Another question is the type of advantage that offenders receive from the intended errors considered.
There seems to be a need to note that there is no disadvantage in the rival situation and there is no benefit in the same match no more, since of course the result of the alleged action is to leave their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match no more, because the club could not rely on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the League of Champions without cardboards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be removed at all times and on the other hand, with this action players complete a penalty match and pass the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards is produced with less than one in the first cycle.
So, writing the steps isn't as clear as it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which makes it even part of the decision making of strategic decisions that favour the maximum benefit of the rules.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (that would be a clear case of the law fraud), but rather they chose the moment they were subject to it.
They have made a strategic decision without adding to or fleeing the penalty.
Even though the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is spread, on this occasion I think there has been a clear case of the genius.
The Polynesian, I think, appears because of two factors: there were two auto-expulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic as it is.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas presents for groups in NCBs
This year's calendar dictatorship focuses on a reservation schedule for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tournament and the lottery, when December comes, there are also dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona restaurants and entertainment, but who have started in an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the client most: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, while men of business and associations of the sector are involved.
In order to complete the accounting, this year's calendar (such as the night of St. Sylvestre tombe Friday) focused on applications on the week of December 13, which has thus far resulted in an average of daily reservations for the few days (the 17th and the 17th) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, many companies have removed collective debts for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
In any event, they ask for all the battle prices, confirm the President of Gremi de Restoración de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the patronage is now unable to predict how the festivals will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he said.
The case goes well "for those who give good price and with a good service", he adds, and he recalls that customers are tending to fall down on a scale with the crisis, so that the cuts around 25 euros have become majority in the application.
In a survey in various facilities at the centre, the survey of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for this Friday, with a claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adjusting their conjucture menus, with complete forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another most powerful group, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the particularity of the calendar has suggested more anticipated reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all the costs of 19.95 to 30 euros," they explain.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuaQu and a total of 23 locations, maintains optimism after discovering a range of billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The Group's sources point out that 18 will also be an active hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the festivals in advance.
In their six group menus they added one for the Christmas, with EUR 30 or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a pre-dependence to spend 10% more than last year than to require more details, such as the Catalan wine produced according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the part of the Patriot Facasarm (including entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomaa, is confident that the end of the tunnel will begin and supports that reservations are "animized", even if customers "not at all".
That is true, the hope regarding festivals has not fallen, regardless of who pays it, indicates it.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern for the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks' filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Ambassador of Pakistan and the United States Department of State, filtered by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the enormous concerns that cause Pakistan's nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the clear and happy details of the discussions and views of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreasing" and that the developing Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
It is also the Ambassador of Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under the Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and vulnerability to the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan's recruitment of personnel with religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korelov, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani level of nuclear weapons production.
An Ambassador's delegation in May, which defines the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often absent; aid offers remain unresponsible or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a speed faster than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" the responsible "Pakistan Army must end with silent support for terrorist groups".
At the castle of the head of Wikileaks
Obama will have a high responsibility for counter-terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to monitor movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "wart red" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, but it is dated November 20th.
And this has nothing to do with the recent filtering of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
The 20 international police officers in Lyon (France) ordered the order to apply for Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday after receiving the authorization from the authorities of the country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, according to the organization's explanations, consider the network's call to be a free way for arrest -- which the national police body must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be found.
The movement led to the Assange lawyers, who yesterday published a letter declaring that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by video conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"It seems to be a disaster, not a legal persecution," he laments.
While the world is searching for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to be found in an unknown place, but he didn't.
On Monday he gave an undisputed interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for giving orders to American diplomats to the United States by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, it should be released," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "rical and absurd" the request for release.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a type with a website should interest us," he said to the CNN.
Obama himself has been charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Russell Travers, to prevent new copies of documents.
The trial of President Barack Obama's speech to reduce the importance of Assange's competitor with the views that policymakers and conservative commentators have proclaimed these days.
Peter King, the congressman who had since January presided over the National Security Committee in the Lower Room, asked the Department of State to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue with anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further, Tom Flaangan, a Canadian president's adviser, Stephen Harper, came back on his statements after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should transform it into a target and use a plane without equipment or something similar."
A person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"The person who is in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of trafficking and anything that is not an execution would be a very loving punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERA with eye clinics at Card adapters
The Republican leader will allow the party to make a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural execution and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to resolve the first internal revolution within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of decommissioning is not sufficient for former leader Joseph Lluís Card-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as intense as his liar and that this cannot give him any headaches that he had with other seniors.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eye clinches that allow him to hide until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 National Council members of the ERC would be able to make a statement on its confidentiality.
By ballots, not in front of your hand.
If the Charoists want to take a certain vote to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of the prisoners.
In fact, the rank leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not be considered to have ratified with half more votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "bulgaria" result would not be better.
The people close to Carod require the president to put his position on the military, a gesture that does not matter when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between the conventions.
But since they do not have enough majority to force them to resign, they will try to create a road map by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the leadership will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18th.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of the convention for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The leader of the ERC claimed that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to make it possible once for all the organization to wash its room in the family.
In this line, the article that current counselor Joseph Huguet signed in his blog was a sympathetic result.
In view of Puigcercós's ideology, the Innovator thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he numbered it five, which he emphasizes two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the military, that is, including new figures coming from the right Carod sector.
The second can be the great new character.
Huguet suggests that the ERC is liquid once for all the assembly as a operating mechanism.
In this way, it defends a reform of the Statutes that enables conventions to be carried out through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finally, with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which had already fought in this sense in the last two conventions.
In fact, the 2008 Concular Confluence led to a review of the assembly model at a specific convention on the reform of the Statutes.
This meeting remains in place, as the internal marina in recent years did not recommend that this matter be addressed.
Now, without critical sectors at stake, the time could be good for the recovery and closure of it forever.
23 executions in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded for 2010.
In November 23 persons were executed in the state of Mexico, less than four months ago, according to MILLION of the state of Mexico.

In the half of the month, two men who had been developed and abandoned in a vehicle in the streets of Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán municipality of Zaragoza were reported to be executed at the same time with the victims of two death warning messages.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony it was discovered in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th covered, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hammock of the village of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man was located in Huixquilucan, who had been buried in a yellow and blue cover, in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left behind.
In Ixtapaluca, with the arms of fire in the nuke, it was found the body without a woman's life in the hammock of San Francisco Aquautla.
On the woman's skin he was diagnosed with Santa Morete's tattoos and colliers with his image.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found on the side of a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impact and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed primarily by a criminal organization, which said, "That's what happens to those who don't agree."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with attached hands and feet, two bodies were found inside a taxi left behind the Center of Justice of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one had been discovered in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was developed into black plastic bags, attached to a canal tube and a message on the side; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the agents found a brochure with a message.
China maintains the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction
The representative of the country in COP16 ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon trace and that he maintained its supply of reduction by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its bid to reduce between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, Su Wei, representing this country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei made great efforts to reduce and convert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stated clearly that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognises the objectives of greenhouse gas reduction, explained it.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated way with governments and locals to achieve energy savings goals, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he stated that there are various multi-year plans in progress or over, both funded by the Chinese Government and other Governments.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has been invested by the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There was also a provincial project of climate change, another for changing fires induction by economic lamps and another fortention and adaptation.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of the country regarding climate change, made sure that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, he said that the greenhouse gas emission in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase 20 per cent energy efficiency in the last five years and provides for another similar approach to 2020, he said.
Legal Explosion of Espino: César Nava
The National Director of PAN explained that the former Panist leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission.
PAN National Director César Nava Vázquez ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Panist leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission.
In his previous interview with the Gabino Cué Monteagado as governor of the state, he said that, in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he explained that this was not the time to think about 2012 and there was never an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidate.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action National would be stronger after the next 4 and 5 December internal elections where a successor should be elected.
"This (a 2012 alliance) is a aspect that has never been on the negotiating table at least for the moment, it has been a approach for local elections that have been successful and have achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "inland competition does not make us afraid; rather, "we will be stronger and stronger," he said.
He said that, of course, the Council would have to choose the best leader/and which Action National needs for the next three years, so he would have said "to the person determined by the Council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the Bureau of the President of the Party to any of the five."
He provided that the relaxation recorded by the party to the elections on 4 July would be reflected in the next debate, even though "it is not the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that make alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the team and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that it has become "a lot of hope in the matter of them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about the PRI criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo and Salinas are better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of love," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make statements like he did in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no balloon in the country, and less than the censorship.
Obama promised on Twitter the law for students without paper
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legislate students without paper, with a message in his personal account of the social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Obama said.
Its short message continues to open a cyberlink with a wider document requesting the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote in the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we expect it soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of the tax reductions in Bush era and government funding were extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs stated that he was confident that once the fiscal problem was resolved, a agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we've had a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given moment in this sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote of debate" for the Dream Act Act, which is why the initiative to legislate non-paper students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even though it would probably be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the U.S. Council Act would be legalized by 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 years, remained in that country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
However, the parties need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need to compete with a large number of Republicans, at times when the protagonists' organizations have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
At least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against and only one Republican stated his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the parties to the Dream Act need the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the shortest republics there are Senators Maine, Olympic Snow and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux, from Florida, who completed his mandate as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not supposed to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the greatest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature on the beach
The second phase of the Language Pleasures was a step forward in which participants took a stand for the narrative.
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... it does on the beach? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second phase of the languages' Plasirs, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and which this time used the subtitles of the question (while the round table has been dedicated to Sexe in the language, she explained).
The dock on the beach "...we put in the embarras", launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who met at the International Forum of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and who participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "play" is, she's going from a doctor to another, without getting an answer, just tracks in the same narrative.
From the infectiologist she's lucky to be convinced: "It's not my strength, it's probably my cry."
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who cut his pain in the middle of the coulair, but who explains to him that tears are not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the tears are what is really open, the symbol is the scarcity."
The protagonist sighed and concluded: "On the beach I only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but is convinced that the pleasurers and the pieces of the language must be very close to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating narrative that he entitled Eloge to the invention, where it does not count on the beach but at a given moment it is discovered.
With the touch of magic realism, he speaks of a famous cloud attacker who would bring back the people who had gone far or repaired the words that a lady had lost, a narrative that comes to speak to America, the great news that had been from the beginning of her own chroniclers and quoted at Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the stories of the conquerors.
"Cervants who invented all of us (the writers) were deceived by false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in another way we would never have been told the history of America with an imagination that was even lacking of power."
However, he pointed out, "the fool and the liar have the best imagination" and here the reality is confused with the lie, we do not know any more about the narrative of a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its support.
It's actually called the "Cervantes tradition."
"It's due to its heritage that we're what we're counting on."
On his tour, writer Mayra Monteyero announced and praised the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table.
The Cuban-Portuguese has highlighted the great scourge of social violence in its country - and Latin America sharing - resulting from trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs bring a silent commitment that is not sure of precedent," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "that must be on the plain of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that is very fast, also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmas, "there is a little lack of confirmation, and behind every denial there is a little yes."
"To be the teachers of our own feelings and the teachers of reality, we need to wake up: and to wake up means a lot of times to put the right on the beach and make people feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established and unnewable ideas and also to deduce the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano at the castle of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three shortcomings in the finals, he had heights and lows in his career, but he had reached the decisive series three times.
With the pain of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, there are more than two different styles that are faced, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by results among them.
Rubén Omar Romano had three shortcomings in the finals, he had heights and lows in his career, but he had reached it three times the decisive series, even though he has not so far placed in the millennium and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
Argentin concluded by comforting himself with the medal of the champion, he remained a step behind the winners and carefully with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategy came to its first end as an interpreter in the Tournoi of O'Operture 2002, when he held Morelia's lines with which he lost with a overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the close 2003 he also reached the decision-making threshold and lost again with the overall 3-1 result and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, already in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournoi, Rubén has again suffered a reversion, as his team has made a match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of the game, but in the series of trials he has gained a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players have ran 11 meters and suffered the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Rojos Devils and one with Monterey, his rival in the tournament, so he does not want to have the same luck, he tries to detach himself from the maléfic to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that the institution is more important to him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the tyrant when he was asked what would be his weak points in the end.
He recalls a lot of the last time, he's sure he's got a lot of learning, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the archipelago doesn't count the end, we can't celebrate, we're ready on the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw us were already prepared to run, and I think it's a lesson, before the end of the match we can't do it."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not concern him, because he trusts in his players: "We never try to reach the series of penalties, we try to end up in the regular period, but sometimes it does not leave us ready, the previous tournament has been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes these are the emotions or the desire to have the title between our hands, but he has removed us, it has served us as a lesson for this end and we hope that we will no longer be in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a low-champagne technician and to enjoy for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People have to go to the Service Centres for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Advisory Section; the waiting period will be shorter.
Since 10 January 2011, the process of processing visas in Ambassador and consulates in the United States will be changed.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to be present at the Service Centres for Visa Applicants (ASC, according to its English seal) prior to their interview in the Advisory Section.
ASC staff will take the biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Advisory Section before the interview.
The new procedure will present some benefits for the appellants, including the following:
The total cost of handling visas will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain a payout, another payment for visa processing and another for the free mail service of the document.
Aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 in the case of visas with request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for the visas of traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas should not present themselves to an interview with the Advisory Representative, they will only present themselves to the SAC as soon as they present the documents and they will be taken into account.
Because biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who wish a second meeting to be interviewed in the Advisory Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra duty rate of $26.
For more information on the new procedure to request the visa, please visit the following page: http://Mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency has cited the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living in space.
The National Administration of the Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 13:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astronomers, science that examines the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When she mentioned the press, NASA ensured that it would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could show the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were inviolable and put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent as humans if their living conditions improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the National Park Yosemit, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too late for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any way, creation uses the arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our favorable atmosphere.
Astrobiologists say, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will communicate the true port of discovery at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), with the view that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
PPD, PT, Convergence and Pattern opposite 'block'
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is said.
The 60th was to be installed when an opposition block led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who became independent and the four were asking one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the 60th installment session of the Legislative session, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PPD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonna' against the reform of the Organic Law, because he excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, since there are now two persons, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PPD coordinator, were the only votes against the Director of PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN party.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme as part of a political will and if they did not, they would be re-served by the two parties and thus the opposition coalition would end.
"Until now (the opposition coalition) is what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron there are similarities and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of reform of the law that has an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and now they talk to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has grown.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'butin' between two, with an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between them."
Patrón Montalvo requested respect for the member's personality, his place in the negotiating tables.
"If they do not leave out of 5 collective agreements which will probably be 9 Members, now that we see five separate groups, we have decided to join us to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, but in the reform that they have decided, we are out and we are not in agreement with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check on the owner's question of the electrical equipment company.
Another 200-mile check of weight for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by Maririe.
With that, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles of weight.
According to the municipal transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the form of "supply account liquidity".
Mr. Luis Miguel López Moreno said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Supreme Auditor to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, as a result, lots of checks will still be issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"We bought nothing, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last Czechs have "reaparated" the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Law, when an undertaking is asked by ASE to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after 25 July, Noroeste had published a review of the Czechs that Marie issued to her suppliers, showing that in the March 2008 interval, in the Triennat of the Marie Marie Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality paid by Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, passed 42 Czechs.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, covering more than 3 million weights.
Tourist sites should be maintained
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of a foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada Round Point in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into a corner of the Sanchez Taboada Round Point, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that were in bad condition and design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Traders of Zone Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the destination image be taken care of and that new activities should replace others that the tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and trottoirs affected them because the tourists were moving there and they saw the disappointment and avoided close trade.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know how lucky we are to lose it, but they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
The hotel host José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the loss of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of Marie.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid that this is going to happen again, as it did, so through a preventive maintenance and not only to correct it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and Mary must change her strategy for the well-being of the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, say, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, this does not depend solely on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has its own property in its beaches, bulevards, permanent entertainment of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention they need, and this kind of fact highlights something that is noticeable to all, care is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary for Tourism Promotion, stated that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and are planning a bad picture.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority for the city to have an up-to-date, clean, ordered, and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Mazzatlán has a lot of historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, cleaned up and put in line to attract them so that they can add to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
The business sector in Mazatlán calls for a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is confused and faces serious problems.
Last year, the 60th legislation was put in place by seven political forces, 19 PRI Members, 13 PAN, three of the Party's New Alliance, two PRDs, one PT, one Convergence and one PVEM, in total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or parentalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs assume the responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations they face.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their rights, free agreements between the parties, because it is customary that they make agreements to protect their own interests and transform themselves into a carnival mask of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establish the necessary points for the current Governor to make progress.
"We will ensure that they do a decent job, especially committed to society and sectors, because the people of Sinaloa gave them their voice of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tris Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and increase efforts by seeking the state's economic growth, as the economic situation is now very complex.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that new legislators give him the importance of strengthening the Secretariat of Government Tourism in the government budget.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a lower budget and is uncertain as an important economic activity of debt and investment, which is directly related to agriculture."
In addition to the need to classify resources for detonating tourism projects that help ensure the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation cannot be resolved.
Searching for king magic
People, cars and bicycles, among other games, are the desire of children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to carry out their illusions, as their leaves are formed by or less than 12 people and a dog.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they wish so much.
The family lives in a humble home of Colonia Salvador Allende and lives daily because their father has no stable employment.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell Mandarines and potatoes...and the afternoon I come out with 'maybes' to sell in the street," said Kayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of children.
Adelaida, aged 4, wants a doll or a bike, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a doll in Barbie.
On his tour, 10-year-old José Alfredo, long enough to have a 'trick monster' and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months, Kayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He said to me (Joseph Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him, 'we'll see, my son' because he was very curious,' recalls Cayetana's sadness.
For the older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, had a size of 12, Isaiah, 10 years old, had a size 10, while Miguel, eight years old, had a size of eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family possible, you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage by offering a game or money at the Noroeste reception.
14 drug trafficking suspects arrested
A dozen investigations have been carried out in Estonia, Wednesday, as part of the maintenance of a cannabis production and sale network.
Forty people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Investigations were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschich, money and equipment for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two heads of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Persons arrested should be compared to Sherbrooke's justice court in the hours following their arrest.
They could face charges of Cannabis production, possession in order to carry out traffic, completion and flight of services, among others.
These investigations were conducted following a long-lasting investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Coastal Security of Quebec, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagg Police Region participated in this police operation.
Clandestine migration will continue without problems
The Bill of Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should address the problem of ships loaded with clandestine migrants, is clearly being fought when the three parties of opposition have informed mercred that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I have a debate with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to a year to hold all persons from a ship identified as transporting clandestine migrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all sides of the opposition are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD’s immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms from his hand that his party was not strong enough about the clandestine immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against clanstine passengers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the bill of conservators because it takes refugees and keeps the children in custody for at least one year," said Mrs. Chow.
Foreign Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"Canadians strongly say to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations aimed at Canada and treat the country as a pallasson."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which would have led the country to elections coming to its rejection.
However, a conservator told the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for a vote so that each opposition member would then be explained to his electors.
The new unit does not make uniform
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil claims that this idea does not occur yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January.
The Metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services in Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the pacifist criticism of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement of "lapin coming out of a hat" and of "brickled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, he's happy to confirm it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charrest refrains from trying to create this investigation commission, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry, Jean Charrest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
Therefore, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the verifier-General to investigate corruption and corruption.
"It must be possible to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the verifier the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing him to be forced to testify.
The creation of a permanent shoe is not the only project in the Charters of the Charrest Government.
Quebec would also request Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be issued by the Prosecutor of the Marteau Operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Supplier that the case was not clarified in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this matter.
During the Printemps 2001 operation, which hit the Motards groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently adopted the Gastrics Act.
High-supervised rivers
A number of water courses remain under high surveillance due to strong precipitation that has taken place in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
An earthquake struck Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated preventively.
In the evening another leak would be produced in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudeière.
A road has gone down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong precipitation has taken place in several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected from here on Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sectors in the north of the river and in the valley of Otauai were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations should be added to the source of the already accumulated snow in some sectors, there is fear of the depletion of several watercourses.
Warnings of flood alerts were issued by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudere.
The waters of the North, Saint-Jérôme, the Laurentides, and the Chenea, in Lotbinaire, were the object of inland waterways and continued to be monitored.
In the Lanaudere region, strong precipitation led to the initiation of certain lakes, Sainte-Juliane, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was brought due to heavy rain.
Ten residences had to be evacuated in a preventive manner.
In Otauais, the debating of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The civil security remains on a warning foot and monitors the situation close, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Québec Cross Prediction Centre has for its part issued mercred warnings of heavy crossings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, The Assumption, Ouareau, the Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Dupont partially bloated
Québec Stéphane Dupont's radio animator was a part of the Canadian Council of Radiotelevision Standards (CCNR) for controversial issues about social assistance and Haitians as well as its growing language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of them contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, the indisputable negative representations of the Haitians and the vast language that do not fit the broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two people who had been murdered, did not conflict with the broadcasting codes.
CNR has received several complaints on comments made during the 2008-2010 broadcasts.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of the Social Assistants of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators must provide solid information rather than misleading.
As for suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a long-term management.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes caused by "Doubt the Midi" have addressed a delicate issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no flower was kept in its place.
The last battle was on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media front that had caused many reactions.
CHOI's animator said that he had done nothing to help the Haitians because we could not be sure that the people in need would really get the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an extremely negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned up my suspension three days ago."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the proliferation of major languages.
In each case, radio broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "in excess of its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, inter alia, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great hearing within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montréalais of Algerian origin Nacerddine Zemmal has a very special course.
The athletes who exhilarate in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing are on the Tamamis and the world's rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the Metropolis since 2008 to develop among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, one who works as a security agent and as a member of the UPS company has just released bad news on its rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Cart and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Championship from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickboxing categories full of contact and Thai box, he explained."
"Now, I'm ready to go to China for the Cup of the San Shou World."
"The fighters who ended among the first four in the last world campaign in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished the eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the tournament in fifth grade, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in each competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a Chinese original discipline where ping and foot cuts, as well as ground projections, are permitted.
The holes are originally on a platform and rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist of this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the Super Tower "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most prominent and prestigious in China, explains the sympathic gaillard."
"It's a little equivalent to the Lumpine Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, half-finally in his category (80 kg), before losing it.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed it."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are finally faced with their category."
"Then, the winners of each category are facing one champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted a fine of $450 million in contracts with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this evaluation of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, who obtained the most important, the project management, for a total of $295 million without bids.
In 2004, the run-up to the Hydro-Québec Consortium called Management Energy was co-ordinated to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium deplored the contract’s lucrative without calling for public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and generate a price increase.
"It's the new way to get rid of fraud and get rid of competition."
"That is, instead of doing so secretly, now the source of openness," said Commissioner Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how public interest could be used in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalia Normandeau, complained after noon, and, unfortunately, there was a breach of this contract.
"I started to travel," she said, adding that the PQ had been "malhonest" and had "no strength."
She said "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a current practice throughout the world.
It is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity taking into account the scope of the work.
The site is running and has to be scaled up to 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition; there was negotiations.
Also, the form of concerts is no longer an exception to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As was revealed last week in The Debor, the Consortium Form in the Gender Council sector is the subject of an investigation to the Government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortiums to be counted, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are designs, bound to one and even moral person, is Dessau.
As for the Green Energy Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James responds to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been particularly responsible for this since the 1970s".
The great patron of Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation of the fact that the project management contract was awarded in grace.
"If you call for tenders and there are few bidders, your price will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people in this market and say, we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's competence," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Consortium Energy Management is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, The Debor entered into 109 marriage contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their branches, including solar laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has renewed 22 contracts, Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract in Energy management of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard explained that the four firms that make up the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau said that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it" before stating that it was more than its leaders.
Consumers responsible barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, more frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer is very low in confidence with sustainable development actors, but also with fair brands and eco-labeling certifications to guide his choice.
Pis, even if he falls into a media universe where messages in favour of a more responsible consumption punctuate, he suffers from a lack of credible information, because he even qualifies as a brake to his commitment, indicates the responsible consumption Barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, however, Quebec seems to grant very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe in the company's environmental commitment as well as the company's green advertising, reveals the measure tool developed by the Observatory for the responsibility of the University of Sherbrooke.
In other words, half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates issued on products that are equivalent, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be irresponsible, indicate the Barometer.
In the same vein, the political discussion on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6 per cent of Quebecers.
However, the information on responsible consumption appears to be primary to stimulate this food of the currently animated consumption by close to three thirds of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the volume and nature of the information calmed the costs of 46 per cent of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecians are also said to be too hostile to the achievements of green products or services that we are looking for to put them between their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to change their habits and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At 61 per cent, they also promoted purchases from traders in their territory and preferred the purchase of food produced in their region, according to the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the indicator of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Québec consumer Homo prefers to present himself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental impact by worrying about the protection of animals.
However, her social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside her car, says Barometer: in 2010, 28 per cent of Quebecis indicated that they had used common transport or had preconceived driving to defend their green interests.
The brand and vehicle were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just been selected.
A State loan for the eXcentris race
The Government of Quebec, to whom it was requested to engage financially in the capture of the eXcentris film complex by Angus and Parallelle, agreed to cooperate, but only in competition with a loan.
The Angus and the Parallelle Development Society, which expected a seven million dollar gift from the Ministry of Culture to purchase to Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on St. Laurent's boulevard by giving him his full cinephilic vocation, did not receive what they claimed.
The Government agrees to intervene in the case, but under its own circumstances.
As soon as the grant is expected, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources of State officials.
A first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec on the last spring, but requests have since been reviewed.
A proposal and action plan were sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, which pilots the document of eXcentris.
He made a final report 10 days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposal came to the SODC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to answer.
It seems, however, that the State's mortgage must be really different.
We recall that the Association of Film and Film Owners in Quebec opposed direct State investment in support of eXcentris, suggesting that the Ministry of Culture did not finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
But several environmental actors called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the director of the censorship, spent ten years wearing the author's film in his complex's premises after funding his own building, which could justify a derogation from the treasurer's Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is growing in Montreal, and eXcentris had its customer loyalty.
The Angus and the Parallelle Company, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 for the acquisition route.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to rent the three rooms on February 27 next, projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember The Debor and we are unaware of what he and his group think of the proposals at the bottom of what they are doing to them.
The road up to a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks bear the blame for what the United States considers to be the Canadian minority complex against the Americans, but at the same time they convey the feeling of superiority to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats wonder that every Canadian elector had no Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located on the public place yesterday, offer more cross-steeling details than the substantial content to be put under the teeth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, either in the full federal electoral campaign, related to the fact that the United States is not a party to the issues discussed by political leaders.
At the great surprise of the American ambassador in position in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations in this regard.
"A Canadian minority complex almost inherent may be the Canadian political leaders to speak of internal issues of the day instead of making this election on the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), " he writes.
The United States therefore concludes that "the proverbial elegant of this election: everybody, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador understands at least this "sustaining silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Secretically, it is considered that the ability of a candidate, a party and more than a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, responsible for affairs in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your travel will help ensure the Government's survival during the February confidence vote on the federal budget, which Canada will show its first deficit over a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion discount plan," wrote Mr. Breese.
It was not stated that the Government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being surrounded by coalitions and that opposition parties were making it a conditional survival of the proposed reconciliation plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the more negative picture that the dramatic series distributed to the CBC bring back to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the emissions of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the removals to the CIA's muscle questionnaires.
Another cable reported that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some of Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "cass per case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he sent a letter to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Let's say that the ghosts are missing about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flaangan, a very close counselor from Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the responsible for this massive eruption should be "killed".
This was done by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations proposed a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) corresponding to almost three thirds of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate of 2020.
This ambitious plan is set out in the group of major projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to compensate for the lack of binding commitments by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if the inductive ampoules that monopolize more than 50 to 70 per cent of the market were replaced by fluocompetitive ampoules or, better, by the ampoules of electromagnetic diodes (DEL or "LED"), the total of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet for human enlightenment would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large exporting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should make GES 53 Gt to 49 Gt global emissions.
But it will need to be removed from this balance of 5 Gt to stabilize the temperature from here in 2020 to 2 centigrade degrees in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of energy is dissolved in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produced from light.
With fluocompetant ampoules, energy spending is reduced by 75% and with new ampoules at DEL, this energy requirement is reduced twice more.
The fluocompetant ampoules last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
New Ampoules to DEL, such as those launched by Philips this week - this company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than an indistinguishable ampoule, which gives an idea of the economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with rheostats in addition to producing very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have shown reservations in place of fluocompetant ampoules because they contain mercury and that they need to be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place signs.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompetant ampoule, but rather the heat centres in the coal, which emits a lot of mercury to produce gas-spoiled electricity in in incandescent ampoules.
In the United States alone, these centres issue 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the achievements of each country through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would spare a billion dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal centres for which it would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of electoral results in the nervousness
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without delay, has underlined a speech by the United Nations Chief Executive Officer."
"He asks all the Ivorian parties and institutions to prove their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results have been announced."
Despite the pressures of some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the Wednesday morning to pass without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday session.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the Chairman of the CEI stated on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied worldwide in order that the CIA finally announces the name of the winner of the second tour between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is based on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fragile" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the fall of the state in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, president's campaign director of the Ivorian campaign, said that UN electoral incentives in the north of the country had discouraged the president's party from voting.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were filed by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political alliance of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who begins to associate with the former rebels, decided "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until the victory was over.
His allies said that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had complained before the Constitutional Council, after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency, Sunday, was intended to initiate the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained fragmented for two years.
The United Nations has warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round, on October 31, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bedié (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France at 3th quarter
The unemployment rate in France for the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable by 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% in the overseas departments), showing the adjusted seasonal variations (CVS) provisionally published by the Insee.
The number of hommers is 2,631 million in metropole.
The second trimester data were confirmed to 9.3% of the population active in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate is rising at 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether they were or not available in the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people present on the labour market is still deteriorating, with a new rise in unemployment rate, with 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points per year) and 25%, including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 15-24-year-olds were in unemployment under the BIT.
The seniors knew for their part a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4 per cent in metropolis (+0.2 points in three months and one year), 482,000 persons aged 50 or more, and 6.6 per cent with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age have had stability in the third trimester, 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polymetic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and announced a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) on Tuesday after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini under review and placed in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was examined and rushed to the Lyons arrest house near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guérini was examined for the abuse of social goods, money and public goods, theft, active corruption, traffic of influence and detention of the population, stating his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and tends to explain all the questions that the master's going to ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue it for a representative crowd of leaders, it's another thing to prove it," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, Brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, by means of his lawyers, pass a memo before his hearing to explain it.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined at night and buried.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to operate the discharges he had to manage.
As for the allocation of markets or the allocation of funds related to their operation, he has never been informed, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Agglomeration Services of Afghanistan, was examined on Wednesday for public funds and complexity, and was released under judicial control with a ban on meeting the prosecutors of the case.
"My client has provided explanations of the facts that are condemned to him."
"The instructor's master took into account the private lack of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night at Wednesday, with a place under judicial control for two of them, indicated the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is continuing for "influence and passive corruption".
Two staff members of the Agglomeration of Aubagna, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were considered one for "sustaining and dissipation of public goods by a person carrying a public service mission", the other for "public fund-distorting complexity".
Finally, the company of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guérini's figure was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently created in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets affecting the Corse.
Investigators suspect that their companies are using the money of the great banditism.
The investigation was conducted in the framework of several open judicial information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for frauds alleged in the public market passage, in particular in the waste chain.
From a close source of the investigation, the research focuses on the conditions of allocation and operation of a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Afghanistan and some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysée has issued Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "exposure", held the opinion in Haleine in France, placed the diploma in alertness, and accelerated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under careful review of U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the consequences of this crisis.
They describe how Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, giving them advice on dealing with their own "takes" crises in Iran (a small group of miners).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of young French had not been to counter the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American court for the benefit of Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they are pleased with a crucial light on how the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to support the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram published on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of arrests".
The Strategic Affairs Adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, deals with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegorne.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so to repatriate their own powerful resource in Iran.
"Facts of noise," they say, "murley without delay" in the media the words "rights of the fundamental man", "inconsistency", "in the immediate release".
It is necessary to embrace the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it as much as the Iranians ask you not to do."
Because, despite attempts by discreet channels, "silence won't rule anything," Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for political singing".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when she is fled to the Embassy of France) "will require the release of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000).
And he knows that the Elysiane is precipitating other drug crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose US claims the extradition for an illegal trafficking of electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released free to Paris on a decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, asks about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine acquisition networks for the nuclear program, Majid Khaqavand's expansion is a bad news.
Did France accept a marketing?
The release of Iran from France?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegorne, on September 4, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
Elysée, he says, has not only "has been completely taken by the judge's decision", but has sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the maintenance of the scenes" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot return to the decision" the judge observed.
Mr. Richier also wanted to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "secret" surveillance of French information services.
The counsellor of Elysée consists of a telephone number, racroche, then informs the American diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss detention in Iran, Elysée does not manage its efforts, through communications and media-organised "smokers", to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity without irony, and they note that manipulation brings its fruit because several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 calls out "the "mediatic blitz" of French officials."
On what basis is the "gratitude" expressed against Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is requested.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then focuses on the reasons why the Elysate has moved to deliver in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's opening policy in Syria," he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad, as prematurated and unmerited".
By "exhausting the role of Syria", Paris seeks to "show to Syria how long it can be held by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sembling the seeds of dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. ambassador knows the good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything about it."
"But we thanked them all the time."
"This should at least be the seed of confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss to enter France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our competitor".
No online games for young Koreans last night
The South-Korean Government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will prevent adolescents from playing online games after a month by blocking their access, reported by government officials.
A draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games by night, to young people under the age of 16, the representatives of the ministries of culture and the family have indicated.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the Ministerial Officer under the bill.
Online games will be re-accessible at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he said.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the time of day-to-day access to these games for young people whose parents are applying for them added.
It will also make available to people who claim free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the unconstitutional champion of online games competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the host countries
In full confusion as a result of suspected corruption, the Executive Committee of the Fifa designates the country's organizers of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, an extremely political choice where influences and lobbying are at risk of taking action on technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the 2018 edition of the Fifa's Royal Competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Portugal, Netherlands).
That 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation looking forward to the conquest of new territories (Qatar, Australia), after the first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implementation in the United States or in the Middle East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emperor, the heads of Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) addresses the economic and political issues of a World.
Treatments in coulses are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it's hard to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be very serious for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of the revelations that resulted in the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the football bat who only received the World once in 1966.
The BBC sent a case, Monday, by sending a documentary that exposes three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to please Fifa and put the English officers in the ambarras, who started in an intense lobbying these last few weeks with David Cameron on the first line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who received the JO-2012 in 2005 for London.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to reduce the spread of England to the EC?
There is no doubt that the two Spanish-Portuguals do not miss out on their already ready stages, their expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their foot culture.
However, the economic and financial cuts of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, becoming an outsider in spite of the shortcomings in its file (states, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putine decided not to move to Zurich and declared a "delegated competition in the preparation of the vote" in an allusion to the charges of the English press against EC members.
"Where they're covered with dust, we're trying to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong in 1994 experience, appeared as the logical benefits.
The first world economic power, the seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a long lead on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very good project separately.
However, these new candidates appear premature for two countries that have co-organised the trial in 2002.
Another threat: the World 2020 award in China, unfortunately desired by the Fifa, would result in the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has played a major role in proposing future stages, and Australia, Fifa will continue its expansion towards new opponents, but these two countries pose more risks than certain ones.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the lack of TV rights acquired (on the basis of the time delay) by European countries, the core of the war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really hot.
Mitterrand thought he was in trouble.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the least stress.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
A mandate to the Elysate calls another.
So the current Head of State will be applied in 2012.
However, the evidence does not do well with the part of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it has to be done as if there has always been a doubt.
In a sense like in another.
In 2006, even without believing it, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15, with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that he would take his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
As he appealed to the UMP parliamentarians, on Tuesday evening at Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" was therefore a bit of febrile.
Was it the official announcement of his application?
We were far away.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of fifteen.
He made a note, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he has been calling the President on the tone of humor at such meetings.
"The worse, or the better, you have been with me for seven and a half years," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the next step."
They don't give him any more candidates than he does; they don't give him any less.
If they hear comments, that's for a second reason.
The acceleration of the course to the application at the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the Royal Segolene entrance that makes Nicolas Sarkozy go away.
In contrast, it is clear that its application in 2012 is that many in the PS claim an early battle order.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's application to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP above," said the Prime Minister immediately and tactfully.
"If he believes the possible failure, he won't be invited," believes Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"I will always believe that I can win," said Alain Juppé, quoted in the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its State securities purchases
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to clarify the procedures for the issue of crisis or, at least, to announce a good number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis will no doubt not allow the Frankfurt Institute to be as persistent as it is in order to worsen a situation that is more prevalent today than it is in the European compulsory markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say if she felt that the central bank had to do more, for example, by increasing its programme of purchase of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my thinking to my European partners (...) "
In Brussels, when hearing the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more satisfaction about his intentions, and he was pleased to point out that the procurement programme for State securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting of this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB has maintained its main management rate by 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB have doubled last week to nearly EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indications, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, the precipitation of a continuation of purchases is no doubt (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect no significant change.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s balance sheet, the latter will continue to apply for limited liquidity allocations under generic conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
The economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine how important it is to change its program."
"Unless this would risk causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," former economist at Norbert Brams.
Openheim.
On the basis of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should have a volume of purchase of these obligations in order to stimulate an anonymous market," says Norbert Brams.
In view of the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area’s sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs at all costs to replace the lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the burden of performance paid by the most fragile States," said an important mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are on the rise, the States will be more generous in reducing their inflation, not stabilising it.
The security of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi makes the two rounds
After a week of concern for Italy, the situation was somewhat delayed, yesterday, with the reflux of compulsory rates at 10 years.
A return to early peace.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said that Giulio Tremonti had heard that the situation was "indefinable" and was expected to be "unpredictable" on a week-end, which the interested party then declined.
In any case, the difference with the long German rates had reached the 210 base points record and the price of cover contracts against failure (CDS) had been reduced to 263 points, resulting in some confusion in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "very concerned" by "market disturbances" and possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
Of course, its problem is the lack of growth and the antony of the tax revenues that go with, putting the State at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest estimates in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate is above 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still represent 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (with 3.9 per cent of the government's budget) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 ( instead of 2.7%).
Where the room of a new budget collector who could be put in place after the parties, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The cores of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short and long term, because despite its important debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's requested stabilization efforts are less than those applied to other countries," observes Pier Carlo Paduan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship at the House of Members, following which earlier elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a period which would be less favourable to the decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still married her during a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I think we still showed her Sunday and night, are obviously strong, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Despite all of this, the detention recorded yesterday on the levels of European State obligations has brought water to the Government's and ECB's mouth.
But we can't talk about a normalization start yet.
The standard rating agency & Poor's announced that it could undermine Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, particularly on banking systems," said the economists of Xane BNP Paribas.
More than "political time is much shorter than market time".
Aware of this urgency and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned ministers of the Fund and, more widely, with their G20 partners will be well conducted.
This also applies to meetings of the European Group and the Ecofin from the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the result of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimate of markets (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-orientated investors of the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare the area.
The first FESF securities issue is scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative entrusted Reuters to the agency that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
First-line countries, Portugal and Spain, as far as they are concerned, are seeking to adopt structural reforms, including on the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that add to the closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to use a different route from Greece and Ireland.
One and the other have a price to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding structural reforms that are necessary to make permanent confidence.
European fund exchangers are ultimately concerned with the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign debt markets.
On 24 November, Axel Weber had first developed the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of the first European sovereign debt market, argues that a round of about 100 billion euros would be provided, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions were met.
Neige and glass: 24 units in orange surveillance
The negative episodes still pose a challenge for the movement, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and may interfere with certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and snow.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, has been added to 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday after noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snowstorms affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it slowly snows over France.
Snow beds ranged from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The severe episodes are sufficiently noticeable to trigger traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, states Météo France.
In Côte d'Armor, several departments were prohibited from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Gingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludéac axes.
The movement on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to gendarmes who recommend not to take their vehicle only if necessary and the movement of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was considered on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture "encourages all car drivers to the greatest discretion on the roads and adapts their behavior accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested air carriers to cancel their flights to the Parisi airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly due to future snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skis
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has taken its toll, billions of people are crying.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion for the Great Paris Metro, which must be built by the Great Paris Society.
In order to launch this GSP, the State has announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a part of the financing of its double bottle.
Today, we finally reach the first additions.
The Correctional Finance Act 2010, examined in the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the provisions to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution of the Great Paris Society".
It is stated: "The product of this tax is €117 million per year".
The second is a reimbursement of a tax on offices that already exist "to modernise it, increase the product and affect this increase to the Great Paris Society".
How much would that be?
Master.
This is not mentioned in the text.
We're out of 4 billion.
"It is stated that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and contributed to the Great Paris Society in the form and extent of the project," we can read in the statement of reasons.
In the GDP, we don't find this exciting system.
"From the time we were created of revenue (the two taxes, etc.), we can cover the studies in three years and drop in the 4 billion after, it is explained."
"It will be included in the budget and taken into custody and measured."
The GDP estimates that 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This provision, in which the 4 billion promised still remain unsubscribed, is likely to cause some parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting was held on 7 December.
Hackers and spies in love
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a clear scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal but in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But we'll proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file is made up of a secret service (of any nation or nation) consisting exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what has been read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's symmetrical profile has been long for cast-off artists.
The rule that secret files should be made up only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to exotic publications, you will see that every book repeats (on the Graal, the master of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not just because the author of hidden texts does not like to do indirect research (I don't know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who turn to occultism believe only what they already know, and who confirm what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informer is parsex, and parsex (or spirit limited) the head of secret services (unless he may be, I know, the editor of Liberation), who does not hold as true what he recognizes.
Top secret information about Berlusconi that the US ambassador of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published last week.
So why did the revelations on these files so loud?
On the one hand, they say that every farmer already knows that Ambassadors, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of State can call or take a plane to meet dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representation exercises, have turned into spy centres.
Any film viewer knows very well that, and that's not just by hypocrisy that we're making it look like we're ignoring it.
However, the fact that it is publicly violated is the duty of hypocrisy, and it serves to place American diplomacy under a bad light.
Second, the idea that a hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a matter of fact to the State Department's credit.
The scandal also does not put the victims as much in crisis as the "boroughs".
But let's go to the deep nature of what happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could design all the power as a Big Brother who controlled every management of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was fully realized since, with the ability to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction performed, the hotel visited, the printed car, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
The power to control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - choose him as a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets can have it?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be disclosed); it is true, too, that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it is relevant to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to remove all his power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the States will no longer be able to place any information reserved - that would bring it back to the public on a display gathered around the street.
But it is also clear that with the current technologies, it must be expected to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of State moved into a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserve reports be maintained in the future?
I know very well that, for the moment, my vision is based on science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who are discrepancyly moving in the demands of uncontrollable travelers, whether they are carrying messages from the heart or, above all, hiding the rare information written in the earpiece.
The information will be stored in a single copy in key shots: in the background, the WikiLeaks spy test was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving on, i.e. to rounds.
A century after the wireless telegram revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegram on wire (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) have allowed researchers in cinema to explore a film that goes forward and backwards and discover all the mounting secrets, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow us to jump off the chapter, i.e. by macroporations.
With the high-speed trains, we're going from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the moves it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, therefore, that policy and communication techniques return to horse cars.
A last observation.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was going on in the embassy secret.
Now, these are Ambassadors who ask for confidential information at the press.
Climate: how France doubles its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the respect of fast-definitioned financing promises (of fixed start or early funding) carried out by developed countries.
And the great French bidouts are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (or EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has played a major role in encouraging its partners to see the reality of its commitment to fixed-start funding: detailed report on the action of its Member States, press conference, large-scale event, brochures distribution...
Transparency operation is valuable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with a level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 EUR 2.2 billion has been allocated, which puts it on the right path to respect its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without prejudice to public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States in which France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that fits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding was maintained and it added 150 million for three years to the start of fixed funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditure or the overall level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), and it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding" ...
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Still, there are no rules and each choose its calculation mode.
Some, like France, considered that €1 equivalent to €1 given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (sometimes related to the execution of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that it will be recovered as equivalent to a euro given... Moreover, it should not be taken into account under its commitments than the cost of the loan for the host country (or the equivalent of an interest rate).
However, France has to do so: it 'response' its commitment to €420 million by 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and 8.5% of grants (33.1 million euros) - see the EU's document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use so much the loan.
Germany requires 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other) comply with their commitments with 100 per cent of the grants.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union set €1 to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Joli pass-by tour!
In summary, in its initial fixed funding, France has a double scrokering: on one hand, on the evolution of the action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
With only EUR 36.1 million, it comes to believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to be Berty who has achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (Why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to prepare?) and in negotiations because the developing countries are not completely duped...
The chapter of early funding is only a small issue, relatively short term, in relation to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be more sand grain in the vast machine that is UNFCCC.
We hope that's not the case.
Whatever the case, it is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): it will not be excluded from the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
So the hope rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and on its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to advance in the discussions.
Warning of children's pesticides
A 10-year-old child enters 81 different chemicals daily, according to a study published by the Association of Future Generations (ex-Moving for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which foresees that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are examples of the problem treated", bought food commonly consumed in four meals and one meal in one day by a child for a decade in the overseas markets of the Sea and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as friands, have been examined by laboratories in the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The acid balance is adequate: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or likely cancers and five of certain cancers as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance are not taken individually, we see clearly in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE consumers is worrying," the association noted.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three known as certain cancers, as well as close to twenty residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The pump, imported from Brazil, intended as an encas by the study, presents six chemicals that, however, are prohibited in France.
The same thing for Kenya's green Haricots, including in the afternoon, about which the study found traces of a potentially banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the stick hexa, the ton in box, and even the bread bag and the rubber Chewing were loaded with pesticides and other chemicals.
In robotic water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues, and even the examination of plastic acid used to restore the meal to the micro-onde was not allowed.
The final risk for the consumer of this "consumer cocktails" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance of Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to launch a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "increasing civilisation diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) was conducted on the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
