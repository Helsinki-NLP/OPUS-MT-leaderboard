Don't shut the door.

I have to go to work now.
Who's this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Observance is one of five senses.
What's wrong with you?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's on the job.

The officer put a white box on the table.
That day I stayed home because of the rain.
Is there an appetizer around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?
I called the police and reported that my car was damaged.
We can discuss it later.
It helps a little.
In ancient Egypt cattle were sacrificed to animals.

Don't forget!
I really think so.
Sonik broke up.
Tom brought his room in order.
Did you apologize?
I don't love Tom very much.
That's why you're going to have to change your plans.
Someone's got him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to meet us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new pay?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a widow.
Can we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
You're my fault.
Tom told everyone that he was killed.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was like when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Take it easy.
Tom's getting out of a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?

We won't let that happen.
These fools violated the law prohibiting the violation of the law.
It's not done yet.

He served in the fleet.
Who taught you dance?

I'm not going to holler.
He lived in the car and went in.
Tell Him everything that's happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.

I don't have time to do a homework job.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still don't know the side effects of this medicine.
Tom's been in pain for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl who came here yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.

Where did he get these bottles?
Don't let me do this.
What'd you do?
Tom usually goes to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
We're with Tom's team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart will be more and more as I see her.
Do I think that's what I think?
All except Tom, you're blind.
She gives him everything he asks us.
Is that going to be sold?
I'll get worse.
Do you have that much more?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It's just making the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a funny look in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can you take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're smart.
There's a little sugar in the package.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something really good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't worry about the strange thing.
Who's in the son of a football?
Toma's American accent.
I don't have any money to buy a word.
Why are you so surprised?
The sea is useful for the sights.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She took care of her marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom's got it.
It's on the third floor now.
It's the left force.
I had to make sure he was coming here.
She said she doesn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy's fixing the hat.
Maybe we're just kidding?

His home for the Holmo.
He was resurrected, and I didn't get up early.
How much lunch!
Mary, are you in such a way now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 repairs.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave him a kiss, she poured out a bottle of wine and ran out of the restaurant, and a dead silence came over.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We've met them.
Tom's having a party tomorrow morning.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't hate yourself, do you?
I think you'll need a credit.
Father Tom, who's in prison, never writes to Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't received any information since he was a hundred years old.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we'd all meet for a long time.
They're all interested in Japan.
It's very easy to get out of here.
Please, just do everything I can.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
It's called success.
It was so dark in the room that I had to ask for rest.
How many U.S. Army planes?
She's your teacher?
Have another drink, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young people grow up in a hot summer.
I'm in French.
If it sounds too good to be true, probably it's not.
Leave it where he found it.
Tom should have told Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it worked.
It's all so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How much do you regret?
Get the mouse out.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her key.
Did you buy something?
Canada is a family of hockeys on ice.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They would agree.
Your Japanese good.
The door went through the window.

Where are the rest of the prisoners?
So much has happened today.
I saw a car crash.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm standing before death.
You know what your kids are doing right now?
You want her to stay?
He's coming after her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We've seen the castle before us.
Tom continued to kiss her.
Six goes in front of the family.
I went to my grandmother's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man who came out of the murky grandmother yesterday.
I think Tom made me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I need to meet Tom.
Tom's lost the palace.
You signed the contract?
I told him he had to talk to a lawyer.
What, they didn't live in that bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom - ant.
What is your most powerful side?
Tom doesn't like it when he's being interpreted.
Interestingly, when Angelika Agurbash sang a song at the words of Nekleev, could she imagine that he would fight in the presidential elections?
There's a yogurt in the refrigerator.
Can you tell us what's going on?
It's always open.
Fomo must be there until two-thirds.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he couldn't.

Tom wants a kiss.
My favorite restaurant burned.
John's not careful, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.

You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants an arse oil.
That's how you feel.
Tom's getting a little drunk.
I barely understood him.
He avoided the curses.
You can live in a big house and not feel lonely at all.
I hope Tom will tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
That's better.
It's all endless.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have a couple of words, Tom?
Don't smile like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're eating six.
He became a victim of leukemia.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little sweet to your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to negotiate with her to help us.
Are you with us?
Forget your wish.
Tom's alive.
It may last ten years, but it won't become a crocodile.
Tom did something he didn't understand that Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw what happened.
I don't think there can be any other reason besides that.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was stolen last week.
How do you always get that energy?
Put your signature here.
What a man!
So you bought her?
A man is as old as he is, and a woman is how she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
You remember what you told me?
There was a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems to be enough.
Tom told Mary she was telling the truth.
You don't want another girl?
I like to play down the river.
You can come with me.
That word is a great gift for us.
"How long before the wedding?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom lived on his motorcycle and took him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes now?
I don't want to play on cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been hunting him for ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes to his head.
Why do you want to go?
How's French going to be "to meet"?
It wasn't that expensive.
What's wrong with your computer?
We were both engaged.
I'm fine.
We're not going to let you go.
You really think Tom's able to swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
They often say that every week in the world, it disappears in one language.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we were talking about it already.
How my parents would have been upset if I had suffered a failure.
I'll wash the cup every day in the morning and in the evening.
Hold your tongue, you won't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before any changes to the existing code are introduced.
I don't have teeth.
I think you're doing great.
Last night we had a strong rain.
What did you get, Tom?
That's what I wanted.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I hurt my grandpa.
I'd rather say something about him.
What choice did I have?
You should stay up.
Back home earlier, Bill.
She sat on the table and read the magazine.
Since then, crying has been prohibited.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
That's where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm not talking to you.
You don't even think!!!
The white one, the house seems to be bigger.
I've had a hard time looking for the original quote.
I had no idea you were with her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give him more time.
You didn't tell me Tom was speaking French.
Tom is back in Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I win.
I mean, Tom played well.
He only blames others, and he never blames himself.
Can you play in the band?
Tom came to Mary and took her.
"When are you going back?"
How many bones live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
At the end of my house construction, I was three years old.
I was disappointed.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do this.
Tom didn't want us to attend his dinner.
I figured out what's going on.
She said she's late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom, almost wins.
What would you like Dad Moroz to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit that wants to end?
Why are you mad at me?
You can go if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
Captain told his people to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom prayed to my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, to think like a man, to act like a lady, to look like a girl and work like a bad guy.
Let me start talking to her.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
It just sounds like it.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in the back.
Put him on the ground.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a large number of vehicles on this road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has a brother or a sister.
He must love you.
It's pointless to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I'm sorry.
I appreciate your support.
You think it's possible?
After all, he's sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better for me.
I'll take care of Tom.
Tom, it looks like he didn't know you.
I refuse to help him.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything other than the Bible?
Read to me the box show in the box.
What's this gentleman doing for his life?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Do your parents know about this?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoebe is not to put the mind above the iron and the knee.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the shock.
I don't know your name.
How many trips to Boston?
What's the word for this song?
Mary likes to hug a brother.
The law on my side.
So we had to find a place to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was denied until the day of the birth of the professor.
You've had a phone call a few times since you were in your mind.
She went out for him because of money.
No bird has five.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just a sovereignty.
It must take its own decisions.
I'm sorry, please.
Your pipes must always be clean.
You've got your birthday soon.
Read it.
I don't like those boots.
Tom has been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped into the Internet.
I think so less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Of course, he is best suited for this work.
You make it easy for me to work.
Tom said he saw Mary doing this.
Tom can't just go.
I love you.
You don't seem to be very busy.
Deline's gone.
You look much like me.
Do you know those men?
Tom left the room, didn't tell anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
You're already late?
Tom and Mary talked for no less than an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you press this button, the door will be opened.
How much gasts do you need?
I came back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the last words?
I'd show you how this is going to happen.
I told Tom to come.
You've got a bag of cake.
Mom taught me not to waste my money.
We could go on foot.
She ended up last night in the second half of the day.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a place for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I called for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We better stay.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm so hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's going after the bad guys.
Why is Tom disagreeing with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they kill them.
They turned Tom off the life insurance app.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Excuse me for my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary are very common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They don't like me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always talk to each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's two of you.
Tom closed the door.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat, which can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you first tell him?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He shouldn't have done that.
The 12th time trip has been a shock to me.
The kid slept in the middle of the night.
I said I stopped.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw how we did it.
He came back two days later.
Tom's late.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are praying.
Eda!
Did you help him take a window?
It's out of my powers.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm here alone.
Don't tell him what happened.
I'm not going to give you that.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I broke the sword.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photo?
Tom gave me money and advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.
Tom said he doesn't want to sleep yet.
She's been married to him for 20 years.
I can't give anyone this word.
Give me that boat.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom is above Mary.
I don't have time to do this today.
Mary told him what would help him.
Multiple ‘person’ means ‘people’, not ‘persons’.
It's in two steps.
You've exported everything!
I think that's why I had to stay in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me the name of the kid.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom's gonna find you.
There's a weakness in everything.
I hope you're well paid.
Tom doesn't eat meat at all.
This book was interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed sleep there day and night.
I see, I'm late.
Your children know French?
Tom called and ran away from the room.
This soup's giving the fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I was teaching in Boston French before?
Tom was so surprised.
They're trying to win time.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, who lived among people, spoke in a terrible manner, from the Jews ’ view, the Galilean dialect of Aramaic instead of the virtuoso, thus showed the inconsistencies of claims of the existence of a holy language that is particularly close to God in prayer.
As a result, Tom thought about it.
My opinion is very different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid for it three dollars.
You don't know all the facts.
I know Tom's doing it.
The weather forecast is not wrong.
Tom, obviously, no one knows.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you some food.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't carry a gun.
That's my answer!
I heard how he drank in his soul.
You remind me of my youth.
Today's Tom on vacation.
I'm always busy.
I'm a little on Fortified.
I thought you were a vision.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in his room.
It's important.
You already called Lucy?
A good idea came in her mind at the last moment.
It's a very cold room.
Why aren't you in the shower today?
Font is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him in your place any more.
Japan consumes a lot of books.
It's very difficult.
You gave me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems to be very busy.
And I'm so glad to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help him.
Is that my book?
The arrow is a routine job.
Who else have you on the list?
Don't give him my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going to go with.
I want to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must have fallen on him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid that fact from me.
Is that what you saved me?
He was very brave in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom knew Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
He's too lazy to do this.
Please stop screaming.
Grandpa always said the days would come, like today.
I didn't say that to her.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
The day has come to an end. Thanks to your temporary efforts, people who have tried to help you in your work have not been able to put themselves in danger.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in the streets.
Tell your people to fire your weapons.
There's a safe door in the library.
Mike's got friends in Florida.
We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
He's trying to get rid of all his forces.
Why won't you be tomorrow?
We need to get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't understand.
Someone has to talk to him.
I never worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I'm living with Tom.
You have a broken voice.
Have you always been such a selfish person?
I think this medicine will benefit you a lot.
Tell him to be here by half a third.
It's not God's news of any science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Do you want to drink a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the brink of hunger.
I learned so much about my mistakes that I thought I'd do more!
My favorite color is blue.
I made some adjustments.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The football player hit the ball.
This book will be sold well.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom wouldn't do that.
Positive atoms attract negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
They all looked at my feet.
Tom was the first to arrive.
Don't help me!
I don't care.
Go to me.
The hotel gave me an account of 8,000 women per number.
I stopped getting angry for fashion.
In Tom's allergy.
I know this girl's father.
I don't know exactly what my children want at Christmas.
Why did she do that?
- Tom's got it?
I finally got to work.
Tom on the kitchen, my trial.
The temperature dropped to three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to dinner.
Tom won't ask me to do this.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was over.
Where do you want to go next exit?
How great is that?
I'm tired.
Tom wasn't familiar with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car will be sold well.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't do that to us.
His words hurt me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know that's why I had to do it.
Give her a call from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer is all of a sudden.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in the answer?
I'm ready to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace is cruel.
I have a deep dream.
That's why we don't have anything to do with ourselves.
I'm from Sidzooka.
Tom burned all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day when he is free.
Interesting what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in thirty minutes.
He told me what he was doing.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I get it.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm glad there is.
What did you just come here?
A million miles.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.
You want to say something to him?
You don't want another son?
How can I erase the veil?
I think we should report that we're late.
Where's our friend?
Don't forget us.
They tried to hide their concerns.
There is a great body in this congregation.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to go?
Please raise me on this side of the elevator.
Tom shot and killed the tiger.
I've never met anyone above me.
How much is the red pain?
I want to drink something cold.
What's your difference?
Each nation has its unique character.
A healthy person does not know the price of health.
Did I miss something interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The audience laughed.
You don't pay attention to me.
I've got a broken boat.
You like taking pictures, don't you?
He is a noble ruler without any fear, no fear.
They hate women.
I don't have much milk with him.
Tom tried to escape.
What color does she have?
Go fast!
You're reevaluating him.
How many weeks ago did this happen?
Tom slept in his room.
You know why this is happening?
I looked around.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaii is my favorite drink.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was the first one here?
Are you going upstairs?
You were home last night?
I was homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
The prices are down.
I'm glad Tom didn't hurt.
I've never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's screaming at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the active engine.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said that Mary from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very clever.
Again and again in our lives there are obstacles, some calling them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him to the fishing.
You won't have this problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.
I'll hear the dog lying in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to go?
We both know it won't happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a city.
I'll be back later.
We need action, not words.
Tom suspected he was a spy.
You're just running away from the problem.
A garden without women like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave one little one.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with this.
I've built on the food chain.
Don't leave your glasses on the table!
We sold our lives for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind stopped.
I've met her a lot.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating apples.
He learns as well as other boys in his class.
I'm not hungry.

He's got five languages.
Tom's had an unusual childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?

Tom didn't tell me anything.
The kids in this class aren't as tall as Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew you could stand!
Tom threw the wood into the fire.
"Love never killed anyone," said Romeo and Juliet.
What did the boy say?
I bought everything he planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you your phone number.
I couldn't let her go.
Tom died six months ago.
I knew you'd be back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving now?
Neither Tom nor Mary were ever in Boston.
Have you ever been married?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Is he hungry?
She went to Paris.
Is Tom in school now?
Please let us know.
Tom jumped and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in my room.
Do you have anything to do with it?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door or we break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't be French.
I think that's why you can't believe it.
There's a lot of trouble in life.
Isn't it too blue?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's yellow.
Tom said he doesn't have any money.
Boston is a beloved city of Tom.
I'm sorry when someone dies.
Are you any better?
What makes you think it might interest us?
I'll think of you every day until I'm gone.
That was a bad thing.
I thought she was coming alone, worried about me.
The river runs moderately.
He looks like Johnny Deppa.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of facts without comments.
He was a dark-headed man.
He's coming.
Is there a message?
Yesterday, Tom suddenly called me.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll take the sides.
I've decided to give up.
The unhappy case chose their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old chair.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
A half-pound?
Tell him I got his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands more French.
Tom's home in a bus going to Boston.
I guess she killed the locker.
I'm sick.
We'll see Tom later.
You want to be rich?
They're calling you.
I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my way of speaking.
Mary wants another child.
I don't care what you're doing with your money.
I'd like to see the Chief.
Tom didn't drive to Boston on the car.
There is no way to predict the future.

How does Tom live?
There's no direct route to Boloni from here.
I live in the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don't worry about it if you don't want it.
I have a command for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" - "No one knows."
What do you like about him?
I came to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.

I've got my eyes hurt.
I like stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom brushed Mary's keys.
I'm talking to him all the time.
I can't laugh at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God prevented the enthronement of Jesus Christ as King and High Priest.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went home.
It's not thin, but it's stiff and it doesn't work.

I hope no one saw how you got here.
It's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I wasn't good.

We're both very busy.
The theme is not visible.

Time can change, but human nature is all the same.
It looks like something very disturbing.
I've got a pen.
Next year Tom will teach French.

Why is that so bad for you?
The hot part of the trip is already behind.
We're not gonna catch both of you.
Don't be such an asshole!
I heard this phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He buried her in the mud.
You don't speak French anymore?
How dare you do that!
That knife was very nice to me.
How do you know I had it?
It'll take you a minute.
I would like to change this situation very much.
We're both worried.
I used to be very stupid.
They're not coming back.
You shouldn't trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a white man in a wheelchair.
That's how he didn't survive.

Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.
He's gone to shit on the hooks in Hokkaido.

You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket near here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you make a mistake, agree.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really want to go with you, but I can't.
There's never been that before.
I wasn't going to do that.

What's your plan, Tom?
Tom is not able to enjoy life.
I want you to ask me a word.
No one likes me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
- "You told him?" - "No, he knew it all by himself."
Your explanation was very understandable.
I missed the rest of the day.
I understand more French.
I'm just sure you were just thinking about something.

Don't look at it.
The mountain's green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.

"Where do you have my phone?"
When are you going to pick up the wheat?

I'm glad she found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're full?

Where'd you stop my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
What's in it?
He gets it all because he's jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

It was said he was going to kiss me.
Don't smell me.
Are you happy?
That's not gonna happen.
I'll tell you later.

Let me do this more.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you deal with her?
I've been to Sapporo.

We're gonna try and get out of here.
Would you buy that?
Tom's on the plane.
She'll always get up early.
Do you want her to help you?
You eat rice every day?
We've sat in the depth of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will our president have a woman?

Writing text, driving a car, is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary won't win.
Why did you take care of the boat?
I want to go back to this house.
How much do you have?
He was a slender man.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fo to stay?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's gonna have to break me up.
I was very calm.
It's all about hiding.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
It's all over time.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw it on the cross.
All men are the same.
Are you crazy?
His son is a genius.
Don't let the case go.
Why don't we have dinner tonight?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told you you came to Australia.
You wanted that?
You didn't tell me you had a brother?
Where are you waiting for me?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were hit by a snow storm.
The book is on the table.

What are we going to lose?
You'd better start asking him.
They killed him against the will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his tube?
She didn't answer him in writing.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop wasting your money!
Tom wants us to stay.
I'm in the kitchen.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom's almost never asking why.
I have to get back to work.

Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What time is it?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You don't introduce me?

She was crying.
I told you Mary had to do this.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How much did you have at that time?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the leader of Tom.
Who are you planning on going to Australia?
Someone called.
What's the better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to walk away.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The trip is sent to thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Free animals from the cell.
He's afraid of a cat.
You look like a father.
George was five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as they told you.
Please take a look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't love your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're a lot higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Fom's out of the door.
My father is an English teacher.
At the birth of Tom and Mary, they gave their grandson a bicycle.

Tom recently left prison.
Did you tell him?
I am!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your grandfather think about it.
I killed her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you would do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did it all.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can the circle be used for evidence and a high assessment.
I can't let myself have children.
When I called him in French in Paris, they only burned at me and couldn't stop these sick people from understanding their own language.
You want me to go?
I was so stupid that I believed in it.
She really did.
I mean, it's very expensive.
I'll find her.
It's been ten hours.
White bread, please.
It's nice.
It's not grammatical.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We treat each other with kindness.
French complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he gets there.
He must have fallen on it.
He says he's not sick.
- Paris away?
How long has it been in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told to do.
Frieda Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday I saw you with Tom.
Where did you get your shoes?
We went to the beach.
What do you think this year's Christmas snow will be?
How was Tom's dinner?
I need a toilet.
I stayed in one of the friends of the palace.
I'll work for you if you pay me the same good.
I'd like to have a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to be paid to me.
She's got it.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's holding Mary's hair.
Tom didn't show me happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom's always dry with his mother.
We forgot to record!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I didn't.
She's the only one I know.
Mary's already gone to her room?
This time I'm sorry.
I like Chinese drinks very much.
It's just what you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a traitor.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's a Venezuelan.
This is it.
He probably hurt me.
Tom won't win any more.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in the inductor plates for direct heating.
I was scared.
Tom wants to learn how to play the trombone.
Get out immediately.
Can I look at your rights?
I'm going to take you 1,000 pieces for the exchange of paint on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom also lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly what to start with.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's drinking white.
He wrote a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in bed?
How much is that worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to walk behind the garden.
The chassis weighs about a hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave that note.
You're a Canadian?
You're the toughest Tom.
I'm watching Tom from half the third.
He likes that.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I'll tell you, Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want, in Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection was in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Sometimes you thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I missed you.
I'm still thinking bad.
Run, you bastard!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only slept after two hours of night.
Mary did not experience anxiety.
So it was not as difficult to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of a strong rain.
Judge at all, she's healthy.
Tom was in the basement.
Look at your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's too late.
Have you already lost it?
I love a hot coat.
How often do you get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change it?
Spain adopted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is just a little out of here.
I don't care about money.
There are no winners.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom's able to paint.
They're packed.
I didn't know what it would be impossible to do.
Are you happy?
Man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You shot her.
You don't get Tom.
Did you kill her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one year old.
I was impressed.
I don't advise you.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom caught Mary’s eye.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wants to go to the veranda.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
How does faith differ from belief?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you know?
If it's time, we'll take it to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but he didn't want to.
Tom read his old hand.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Tom saw it?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it was to say.
His eyes were wide open, and his eyes were normally white and covered with Romanians.
What kind of bitch do you love most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were cut off from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your bag.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I don't want to see you when I see you.
Why are you in my boots?
The power in Tom's hands.
I learned to play and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not busy anymore.
Children like to play more than they can learn.
They took him for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone says I'm like my father.
Remember what I'm talking about.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who keep on talking about politics.
Is it beautiful or white?
We're not afraid.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
All of what, suddenly they're in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend that long.
You're sick.
Our grandson was born last night.
On Tom's pirate suit.
That's pure truth!
They're going crazy.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom must be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll let you go.
We'll be proud of our achievement.
So Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
Do you love each other?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities were closed.
I do it every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop being a cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this person is the one he's going to give up for?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezuba, has joined Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were a honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was warned.
That's why Tom could stay longer.
Almost everything was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days have been very hot.
He's got a black coat.
I forgot to take the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom's very generous and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom picked up Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gesse.
I'm telling the truth, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases came to the court, it was generally accepted that there were twelve persons in the court.
What was Tom doing in Australia's embassy?
Tom and I started meeting.
The boys walked by four in a row.
Tom was very busy.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do this.
It's been one more day.
You have to do this right now.
I'm gonna have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He died when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got comedy tastes all over my hands.
Tom, come on, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing on a trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably can't do this.
I'm sorry you doubted.
McDonalds is known worldwide by his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a great gift.
Do you have any idea?
Do you like these ghosts?
The castle is broken.
Almaz is a precious stone.
Calm down, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he was married to a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want better.
It works as an officer.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self - esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Ellis had encountered, waiting for, was an infamous war, so loud enough to break her drums, and so loud enough to reach heaven.
I lost him in the dust.
We were talking about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why I can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books will be published every year.
Tom gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My steel car broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to borrow him.
I tried hard to solve the problem.
You should've done your homework.
I was talking on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right for you.
That stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why don't Tom sleep?
As it turns out, it's called off.
We took a little cane.
Have you ever tried a banana pirogue?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Well, isn't Tom remarkable?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his zone.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your names.
Oskina's been down on a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your kid can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom, I've got the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President shall be four years old.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can't you solve this?
And Tom, and Mary here.
What would you do with that?
In the building of twenty floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You're probably not in the race when Tom's coming back?
I don't have Tom's photo.
Can you wait a minute?
You're gonna give him something for Christmas?
She won't kill him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm a Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this song.
If he followed my advice then he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to touch the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How many do you plan to be at home tonight?
The drought is gone.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as good as he is.
I think you can stand up for it.
She knew she wasn't right.
It's so fucking crazy!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to dinner.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom talked to me last night in the snow.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but he took a girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We must maintain the plan.
I'll tell you what you called.
Tom's very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's getting ready to go to hell.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm laughing at a manoeuvre with a cat.
They're always sorry.
Tom's got a little success.
Do you understand what she said?
You're something crazy.
It's not wrong.
I'd better stay.
That's why she came to the head with a brilliant idea.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a terrible place?
I didn't know why Tom's late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe it's all right.
She keeps her room clean and orderly.
I guess that's why I have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go to a foreign land.
Tom was in fear.
It's just that Tom grew up.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
You're afraid of your own darkness.
Tom was very pleased.
He had an abstract understanding of hunger; he always had enough food.
There's a new roof in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
I'm the one who threw me out.
Unfortunately, yesterday was rain.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you scared of the cross?
How much do you want to go in?
She's got legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What's the same square root of two?
Tom stood in front and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you'll see.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that very often.
I hope we don't do this anymore.
How many times have you helped him do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost trust you.
These precious treasures are dear.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get to it, it's time to open.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also good for animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom included a fonarchy and went into a cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Fom's gone from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was pregnant.
Who doesn't wake up?
We cried with him.
Don't you want to try again?
Wait a minute.
What are you going to do?
From milk you can make oil, cheese, and a lot of others.
You have no authority to do so.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who've got a cold.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her names.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for the younger daughter.
Take care of yourself.
Do you like jazz?
You're a drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unnamed guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as they were waiting for.
He moved in the answer.
Tom said Mary's enough.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right track.
You'll get everything if you try.
You didn't think you'd ask Tom for help?
Try it.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Couldn't you say that in human language?
No one's got a promotion except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in a snowy lion is considered innocent.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French more like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom doesn't want to go.
When does the shop open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He's wide-eyed.
It's time to fly.
I really enjoyed this book.
You're important.
When ice falls, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she wouldn't stay overnight with her.
Tom didn't tell the police his name.
I went to school there.
The fish's too bad.
Try to remain positive.
I'm sick of it.
She sucked his ass.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a very beautiful shirt.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been lying.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who's playing with Tom?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my job.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming?
I remounted his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom is above you.
Tom found a job without a job.
This book in public access?
Please, can't you say a word?
I'll tell him he's in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please call me, not like Jacob Matthewwich.
She's not one anymore.
Tom will never admit that he's wrong because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I was already in America.
It took more time than I thought.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have a new Steve Wanderer album?
I was expelled from my house because I didn't pay rent.
Tell me where you went.
He stopped opposing and obeyed the court.
That's what happened at Park Street.
Eduardo's younger than Roberto.
The moon is the satellite of Earth.
I don't know.
There's nothing useless in nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You've done it awfully!
You don't need it.
Tom rarely goes to dinner.
You don't have me.
Tell them we're eating.
I'm like a guy who wants to marry?
I locked the door, but I didn't close it.
Therefore, it would be wise to be cautious and not to criticize Mary properly.
Can we help them?
Thanks for calling.
They're happy.
Please don't be so tough with me.
Now I'm in command!
People, we've been good for years.
I'm not sorry.
I know Tom won't make it.
I don't like her very much.
He's not.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20.
She thought I'd take her.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom took his secret with him to the graveyard.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
I'm probably very fond of you.
Why are you worried about her?
I'll never do that again.
Do the visitors exist?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better than them.
Do not try to remember every proposal in the text, it is almost impossible.
He's been studying French for eight years.
I thought it was you.
I personally think you're right.
I can't believe I did it anyway.
The candle's up.
Why don't you get something to drink?
We're collecting clothes for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a very good salary.
What do you think?
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to start.
I thought you were right.
Why are they looking at us?
Where's Tom's key?
Am I right to make your name?
No one saw her leave the room.
W-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He allowed them to play on the garden.
I don't have a crush.
Your love is false.
She's like my age.
Did you really do this free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys, girls girls.
You're late.
There's nothing new about his addiction to alcohol.
He doesn't know the risks.
That's why I don't have to do this anymore.
Do you have any ideas that could have done this?
The teacher warned us that exams would probably be complicated.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son's camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I promise you this song.
I love her more.
You're too young to know that such a logistic line.
I did it almost every day before.
I'm deeply shocked.
About a billion people suffer from hunger and poverty.
It is my pleasure to inform you that your work has been accepted for publication in “SM”.
I believe in my right.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
That's why we have to go with Mary.
It's interesting what Tom's doing here.
You're not capable.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand has cut off the murine.
That's why he didn't have to go straight.
He'll be out of his parents' house soon.
I don't think he'll listen to us.
I want to go to England.
Did you see anyone in the park?
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom moved here three years ago from Australia.
She left Boston.
We have to consider all the options.
Tom could have killed me.
Uncle Ali was a drummer.
Why didn't anyone tell us?
He's going to the beach.
I went to look for Tom in the fire.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He's less aware of his problems.
Tom said he saw NLO.
I know who you were with.
Do you have Tom's bike?
What did you ask them?
And the repair didn't go bad.
I miss every morning.
It's not bad, it's bad.
You got a car problem?
In the tourist information center, the city's map was issued to anyone who wanted to.
I'm so sorry, but I can't.
Tom closed all the windows.
Come as soon as you can.
We're not very hungry yet.
Learning Chinese is not to impress her future boss, but to understand what she is saying.
You can add suggestions that you can't transfer, maybe someone else can do it!
Is Mary always home?
Just don't pay attention to Tom.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
I'm sorry, I didn't notice that.
I teach.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I've tried my best.
It's a good sign.
Some are convinced that their guardian angel is protecting them.
Tom left his bank account.
She's in the fire now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he paid his attention.
I told him I didn't care.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you didn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is stronger than money.
I saw him with my head.
In our library are many children's books.
I didn't leave her home before.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't want to interfere with you.
We all wanted each other to win.
Tom was born three days before his birth in 2013.
The young girl was deaf.
When Tom heard about his favorite song on the radio, he could not stop singing.
When will it end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The five-and-a-half-year-old left after the party.
Is Tom meeting someone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving a car.
They're good.
When you're back, I'm already gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped meeting him.
Tom calls Mary.
It smells flowers.
A woman often calls me when she walks across the border.
You're lying in bed.
First of all, I would like to mark my position carefully.
Tom is able to play in the band.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.
Please, turn on the radio.
Don't bring Tom to the lake.
The police can't arrest Tom.
How did you fall into my room?
What do you want to give to him?
We want to go to Australia.
I have a very small salary.
Tom's got a bear.
Tom knows where Mary is going.
You shot them.
Tell her, let her go.
I don't know anything about that.
We've been meeting for three months.
I'm glad you were there.
They made me a big party.
This mountain is covered with snow for a year.
Tom stopped at Mary's store to buy sugar.
I like to be a rice.
Stay away from here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen in your life?
I thought you hated us.
Think carefully before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it for a joke and didn't answer.
In fact, his name is not Tom Jackson.
Is that a joke?
Do not do what you will regret.
Do you see her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be made depending on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to play sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I decided I wouldn't stay.
I'm waiting for you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you what I was thinking.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There's no exception in the envelope.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home earlier today?
You wouldn't have survived.
Tom didn't think Mary would bother that.
There's a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your ass.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom is a hot drink.
We don't even know her.
Tom made a few suggestions and checked them on Mary before going to Tatoebu.
I know where you're going to put your money.
The school's over.
It's a long career.
Does your mother know about this?
Do you really like this kind of food?
Tom looked at the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
Let the coffee go.
Please write it down.
We can't go.
He became guilty of his crime.
It's a beautiful picture of everything I've seen.
What are you doing here?
Something's bothering him.
In time, Claudia thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree with that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back later today.
She's very proud of herself.
I went down about half a third.
Don't leave the tape on the sun.
I already knew that.
I saw how they went.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
Help, help!
Can I open the door?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.
He drank as much as he drank.
Let the earth be your breath, Father!
Why are you still alone?
I want to make friends with your sister.
Who were you waiting here yesterday?
You like five?
The road is expensive.
Tom's making breakfast.
Come on in.
I'll keep them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will broke up.
How are you, Tom?
Tom says he never did that.
Tom seems to be a nice person.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to go to the church.
The fires couldn't stop the flames.
Help finally came.
It's a lie.
That's what happened here on Monday.
America ended up slavery.
Don't you know him?
Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often spends hours reading books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom broke the car.
Tom knew about Mary something he didn't know John.
The answer is no.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I had a negative headache.
Tom, they're calling you.
You promised you wouldn't drink today.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Let's see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you coming tomorrow?
A pair of open-eyes.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is that a flying fly?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me I still need to know.
You can't let me marry you.
That's weird enough.
I've got a yellow letter.
I woke up and she didn't.
Today we have plenty of food.
He said something that supported my point of view.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a sleepy volcano located in Tanzania.
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't turn it off.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get the driving rights.
I need to get back to Boston.
Have a good time, please.
Wake up, Tom.
Here's the map.
You had to stay with us.
Let's imagine we're insulated.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I don't want to tell you anything.
I'd prefer you not to talk about this.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not going to regret it.
They kept their love secret.
She was on her knees only to rest on the trip.
Don't tell me that's my news.
Tom always had to pay the bill when they and Mary went to the meeting.
I urge you to reconsider your decision.
I don't care about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt something strange, I didn't know it was.
You're a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you take me like I am?
It's a black bear.
Tom doesn't even know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard to get to the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terrified.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll be right there.
I don't trust her.
Sixty-three is equal to eighty-eight.
‘Scala’ is an anagram ‘Laski’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a campaign against racism.
You did it fast.
I need to set time in two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your offense.
I think you're doing great.
She was so gravitating that she surprised all of us.
This is where she worked as a secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it'll be okay.
It's hard for me to work with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says his son is now able to count the cost.
There's something wrong here.
Tom hates these things.
There's a small garden in front of my house.
Why didn't they leave?
I heard you paid someone to do it.
It's for my friend.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
Tulpan is an official color symbol of our prefecture.
I knew we'd become friends.
I didn't want to lose him.
She's in hell now.
I'm going to give you some lessons in karate.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom's getting cremated tomorrow.
That's not true.
You're no longer allowed to do this.
In the summer cannibals in Karuidadzawa, tourists flocked.
I saw Tom grow up on a trip.
He didn't do anything wrong.
She's got glasses.
I love this advertising.
It was just water.
I bought it for my sister.
I'll never forget how we went to Hawaii with her.
No one heard the call.
How did it get here?
Tom and Mary said they don't want to touch.
I'd like to go with you, but I can't.
On 11 September, the world's policies condemned terrorists for their decent treatment.
Please call me Taro.
I know both of them.
Don't you want to meet him?
Now Tom's scared.
You said it was urgent.
Tom's very happy.
I didn't want it to be the same with me.
I don't know all the students.
Thank you so much, you're just ruining my life!
Kill civilians.
Tom told me to treat people with respect.
He did what you asked him to do.
Excuse me, where's the egg?
Peace be upon you.
I don't know.
Tom is a cruel businessman.
I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary don't agree with you.
We'll tell you soon.
Let's split up.
He'll never find the keys.
Her way of speaking upsets me.
Eat what you like.
And what happened then?
Do you think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do this.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep before noon.
I just wanted to go back to my old life.
I'm sorry she called you.
I've already told you everything you're supposed to know.
Health gives a person the freedom that most do not know until they leave.
Is that important?
I know the secret of Tom.
Tom is a man.
It's not nice.
No one could believe that.
Tell her I'll repair the refrigerator.
That's amazing.
It's bleeding out of the ear.
Post-modernism differs from modernism.
I've already read this book.
I'd get him!
He's a big enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
You really think Tom is sick?
I'm not afraid of that.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could've done anything faster when I was praying.
I wasn't worried.
John, the tallest boy in our class, has the name "Mister Highness"
Tom's leaving tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you know him?
I was, in general, all the same.
Tom's got a bad one.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't make that oxygen face!
The white one?
Tom came first.
They were being heard by strangers.
That's amazing.
The sky is covered with clouds.
It's a bird under the threat of extinction.
You loved her very much.
How do you live?
Tom didn't seem to like him.
I'm all out of my mind.
You said it was important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
It's called her green hat in the woods.
I don't want to.
It's time for children to sleep.
This can be done.
I'm easy to breathe.
Tom won't hate it.
It's okay.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in corruption in our country.
Did he take off his pants?
I can't separate him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone fire you?
I really need someone to shut up.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come here now.
Last summer I made it easy in Canada to fall on the bed.
That's accepted.
Tom says she can prove that Mary didn't.
I was born on January 2, 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of jail.
I'll let you in with the animals.
Tom's got hope.
He speaks French and, of course, English.
Get this stone out of here, please.
- And who's the happy picker?
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I've been impressed with him.
It's been on this station for about two minutes.
Get up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think would be safer?
I know your father.
I heard you screaming.
He's the guy who drew this picture.
"Call up" means call on the phone.
Who'd notice?
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Do you have a question?
They went into the forest.
I'm talking too much.
You show the way.
The light of the sun.
Coral reefs are life-threatening.
Tom said he knew Mary was planning to do it.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night the temperature dropped below zero.
"You can't carry it." "Why not?"
Tom was wrong.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer to walk on foot instead of riding on a car.
As it turned out here, it's impossible to know now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
Many of the votes were made.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you now.
He'll probably get up soon.
He did not fully understand that this was a differential equation.
I know that confidence.
Be mature, Tom.
Can you separate Tom from his brother-in-law?
I don't pay for it.
Tom removed the sex tapes from the latrine.
Don't get up.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she's doing it on Monday.
Tom's too fast.
The popularity of the telephone has led to the fact that fewer people today write letters.
I think we're almost ready.
The woman came to our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?
My uncle's dead, and I'm awfully upset.
She's a sister.
I have a pink car.
It's so quiet.
In the most beautiful colors are the toughest chips.
You better get up.
It should be given instructions.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very uplifted.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy baby.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq differs from Iran.
That's why they told themselves not to do it.
Two days ago, I caught my ass.
I've been waiting for him.
You don't have to do that.
Let's drink in that coffee or something.
You got something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom - he'll tell you the same thing.
And he saw it on his own, and he took his hands off.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I thought about him.
I'll be waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
I don't have a conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I'm excited about your affection.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't let me do this again.
Almost your turn, Barar!
You're free.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry, couldn't you ask again?
What do you think they're doing with Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does this.
I don't want anyone to do that.
It's gonna work on these exits.
Give it to her, please, I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President ' s efforts to introduce more strict arms control once and for all have been interrupted by powerful weapons chains.
I think we're familiar.
You don't appreciate Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'm trying to say that in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You've got enough time.
We should've been more careful about planning.
You have to sleep.
I'm proud of my father's good luck.
You want to tell me something else?
Fomo's trying to explain the situation.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one's been paying attention to me.
So it was thirty.
I'm going to Boston on a bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Get yourself dressed like a suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who does Tom like?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break the plate?
Tom was hiding the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he turned out.
Why did he need it?
It's the capital injection.
It's really hot.
It wasn't time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the knife?
Meg didn't even look at me.
You promise?
I know you've done this awfully.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on the Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
Thank you.
Until certain conditions have been met.
She's not like everything.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about a person before you meet him.
What actually happened in the past in Boston?
What does it mean to learn?
These Persians aren't very sweet.
I don't think these black Fridays can be taken out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me cry.
I can't forgive his tears.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom got out of school.
Tom said he was very alone.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim is four years older than me.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure you meant it.
Tom sent the daughter to sleep without a knife.
I'm going with you.
They cleaned up the snow street.
Tom and Mary must do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom firmly decided to kiss the mask.
Are you very hungry?
What's going on with him?
Tom and I are close friends.
Where are you going?
I had blood in my brain.
You can't always win.
There's some kind of dementia.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
Cartina's on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
I've prepared for him.
Russia has become a second superpower.
I'm worried about them too.
He went to mail to send a letter.
Find this bottle of water in the cupboard.
Are you coming with her?
Let's take one of the ready dishes that are sold on the corner.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go over the border?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How did you get to know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about four thousand dollars a month.
You can't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You're talking like my grandmother.
I don't have any relatives.
Let's see something else.
You think it's a correct translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to.
That's why I'm here to do something.
Try not to worry about us.
Stay here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't get in the door.
You should take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you stop, sleep!
I'm afraid I don't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to go further.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to have dinner on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You don't turn off the radio?
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Tom is an experienced game.
I wasn't ready for this.

You're talking in a dream.
That's what Tom taught Mary to drive.
I'm just doing what I'm doing.

I'm looking at you at the door.
He's always a little upset about tomorrow.
It's either early or late.
I needed him.
Is there a mail in here?
I don't think I can be happy here.
I need a box.
No one's talking to me anymore.

These flowers sent Tom.
I'm still alive because of that.
I went to dinner.

I'm glad you're here now, Tom.
Where did she find this book?
Have you recently received information from your sister?
You have to be late.
So what do you want to know?
Tom didn't leave, so did I.
Please select an expression.
He just came back.
Mary was smiling.
You'll have to wait here.
I stopped hearing your complaints.
Tom and Mary, as usual, took some time.
Please tell them it's urgent.
You'd come great for this job.
How does Tom live?
We gave her some apples.
I'm not jealous.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Can you briefly describe Tom?
I had to tell him to wait.
Please, wish me luck.
I'm glad he's alive.
Tom left me in the parking lot.
I didn't want to bring him to the lake.

Eat this way.
It's almost winter.

I've been running before.
I don't know, there's Tom's a bike or not.
Don't let me lose patience.
I love a lot.
I don't think you have to do that.
Tom is now in danger.
He's not his wife.
Don't do us any more.
How much longer should I wait?
I don't think I need any permission to do this.
I need to find her.
We needed Tom's help.
It's through the nose.
Look at this from her point of view.
Tom didn't just swim.
He's got a literary talent.
God can do it!
Bring the kids.

Critics don't run away.
Please tell me it's not a bomb.

I'm on my way.
I'm apploding.
I forgot to take the flowers.
Tom picked up things and left.
She's talking about you all the time.
I respect you and Tom.
I was on my way.
Tom made a decision on his own.
I thought you'd be busy.
Can we wait here?
You're unprejudiced.
Tom cleans his teeth at least three times a day.
Tom was able to talk to women.
Let's determine our location before we go further.
She called me the next day.
Tom sold his car to Mary for three dollars.
What did that mean?
You should have told me earlier.
I've got a cricket in my garden.
He's looking for work.
I'm looking for my cat.
I had to ask her first.
Welcome to the flag!
Who ate all the bread?
We'll fix it.

Tom wanted Mary to prepare him something to eat.
Don't leave me alone.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm sorry, I'm leaving for a second.
We didn't ask.
Tom knew what to do.
I know that's not going to happen today.
I don't think that's changing something.
We've made an escape to the lake.
I didn't know who you were.
She's reading her favorite book.
Tom's been very quiet.
The queens can swim.
I've got some money.
Our team has a bad chance of winning.
One square metre of the solar battery produces about one breath of energy, so it is not easy at this time to use solar energy in large amounts.
Who knows why Tom did it?
This new machine?
I have one question for you.
He walked out of here in ten minutes.
Who are you to solve this?
Get the bag.
Tom's a little busy, so he can't help you today.
What's your plan for the exits?
They can understand us.
I'm sure he's coming.
Go and ask him.
Let me see.
Good luck is just a trap in the sea.
I agreed with Tom to drink after work.
I'd like to have a car like that.
I'm a woman.
Tom didn't sleep last night.
Luckily, Tom's got the only son of a bitch.
Why did you take care of the fight?
These manuals differ in quality.
Tom came to Mary.
Tom's not used to it.
She suffers from an early disability.
Give me a phone call.
That's what you told him he shouldn't go?
There's nothing in the summer compared to the sea.
I saw her playing piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't come.
You like driving a car?
The car wasn't moving.
Mary knows it was wrong.
It's a little bit tight.
We're trying to keep quiet.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She spoke fast.
That's why Mary shouldn't have lied.
The baby's in the cage.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom made a big offer and rewritten it.
You could've been hurt.
Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke until you work.
Tom wanted to play with us in poker, but Mary didn't let him.
Tom didn't do anything for a week, just complaining about Mary's shooting.
I think the car's too slow, and I can't do anything with my big hands.
Tom agreed?
I want to be a Canadian.
It just happens sometimes.
We all pray for Japan.
Nobody wanted to talk about my country.
Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You're willing to spend your money whatever you want.
Do you want anything?
She went before I came home.
Tom wasn't the only one who was arrested.
You could've done it!
You're just doing worse.
I think you should breathe a little.
He's a good man.
I can't guarantee that we can finish our work on Monday.
I didn't do that very well.
You really need Tom.
I appreciate her generosity.
Papiamento is a beautiful language.
I don't want to shoot.
I believe in love from the first glance.
Do you remember what they're all called?
I'll take a kiss.
I couldn't wait for them.
Tom thought again.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you'd never meet him again.
This publication is not for sale.
Her dress attracted a lot of attention to dinner.
They're going to get married tomorrow.
She was right, and he's wrong.
They're wearing the gloves to go first.
Maybe he'll ask us a way out.
Luckily, it worked.
Tom didn't call.
He said it was simple.
I like spending time with friends.
I didn't know you were Canadians.
And if you bring forth a child and bring forth a sign from the moon, then a sign from the moon; and if you bring forth a bird from the sky, then it is on you to watch.
Tom took his beer.
Tom didn't want to explain anything.
I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.
She was born on 4 April 1940.
At the end of this year, the economic crisis will arise.
Don't let anyone go to the fire.
You didn't know them?
Tom showed Mary the letter she received from John.
"Psalms are sweet," said the girl.
That's what I want.
Tom once taught me French.
Where did Tom take that coat?
Do not forget to close the window.
Could that be acceptable to you?
How am I going to get to work?
Tom says he'll fix it.
I suggest you put me in charge here.
These news for me is new.
Tom wants you to help him do this.
She's got a very urgent schedule.
Tom also speaks French.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
In the garden are colorful tigers.
I told her not to do this.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do this.
We're going to want you to succeed.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put toys in his pocket to play.
I don't want you to be ashamed.
He said he was coming.
"Doctor, I'm all ignored." "Next!"

Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a show.
Come closer.
We stayed in Hilton.
That's why Mary has to tell the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.

All the attention!

Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
It's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like this.
You're not hiding anything, are you?
You lie to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account shall be paid up to the first number of the following month.

I can't talk about college.
Tom lives far away from you?

The first is Tom's name.
What else did you let go?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long is the trip going on?
How much is this trip going to Boston?
You didn't see that?
I need you to call me.

When I get rich, I buy a farm.
I gave him a piece of bread.
It's a neighbor.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come last night?
Where can I sit?
You can't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Take it to France, please.
Take the cold chair!
She needs a cab.
It grew so fast.

Kiss her and kill her.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?

In Tom's weak heart.
That's why she's gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you give me a carpentry knife?
Tom took his weight off.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do this on your own.
No one saw how you took it.
I'll get half the Japanese.
Tom says he'll correct her.
You have to go back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I was finally able to do this.
Tom didn't know why Mary was pregnant.
Don't worry, easy test.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the 13th?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's going to a white boy's doll.
It's a mountain.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was a resurrection, not a Saturday.
Anyone here with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's wearing black clothes.
We ate in the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of prospects in this town.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married the next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told him yet?
She's got a double armor.
We can't force people to do this.
Let them take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't tolerate this color.
Do they sleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
He can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her go.
We were welcomed by our neighbors.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot him in the closet.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust him.
She's got a lack of it.
It's interesting why that's why it's necessary.
I think that's suspicious.
I'm gonna make it look like you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston here.
Do you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to celebrate?
You're a friend or a enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
The winter will be over soon.
I don't mean any titles or rewards for me.
Where did you actually find him?
The meeting was slow.
I know you.
Have you had a good time coming out?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it. Don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need enough.
Bring him to drink.
What do you want to eat on these exits?
Get up!
He wants to be rich and famous.
She kissed me.
He's afraid we're going to go crazy.
I can't call him home.
You had to apologize to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me that's a woman.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
It looks like an optimist.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help him.
I'm joining you with her.
She received the highest evaluations.
Tom can wake up.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you have with your child?
I went into a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do this.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a double dome.
I'd like to take care of it.
Give me a note or something like that.
I don't want to get out of the house tonight.
He'll be here today.
Cot died.
Just half a nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you shut up.
It's dangerous to swim in this lake.
I've got a stick last night.
Tom wanted to come with me today.

Tom said he's glad you're back.
My car is covered with a deep breath.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lory's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not gonna make this mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I agreed to marry her.
I spent my whole life that day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The solo came into the camp.
It wasn't him.
Do you have a list friend in Indonesia?
You may come to her aid.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play with you in chess.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be happy to give it to you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where's your brain?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Prevet," the robot said to Tom.
Where are you?
I didn't die yesterday.
I'm sorry.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of vehicles passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dogs.
In the attack!
Look at the treasure.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any other questions?
A new proposal as a message in a box: they will ever transfer it.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you hear me for a minute?
You were all in love.
We're his relatives.
I've got your grandmother.
I'm sorry I drove you out tonight.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a snake?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She began to recover in her new office.
Let us worry about it.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I was planning on doing this yesterday.
Now a couple of lunches are drunk, aren't they?
My parents don't like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit his boat and hard.
So what's worse?
It's not worth it.
Can I take you for a hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to break the cake?
Tom hasn't slept all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about the target.
The series needs to start seeing when all seasons are gone!
Road accidents occur every day.
Where did you go to fall on the lies?
You were in the parking lot?
A prospector.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a scarf hand.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a photo together.
I missed the exam.
They already knew about it.
You better go help her.
A football player made a huge mistake.
They're coming too?
She sleeps like a young man.
Tom forgot to leave the brake.
This song reminds me of a girl.
He says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The storm blew all the building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they got drunk.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children already?
Tom didn't want to interrupt.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a selfish idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let's get the code out.
I know you're all crazy.
Tom thinks it's a sin to take out the products.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is going to be lost.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this yet?
I'll never hear you again.
I never doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved greatly.
Let's go to church.
Tom's taking a whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I haven't met him before.
How much did he take?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The fish that you sow is not made alive unless it has been given its own strength.
I've been the same before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The thief steals and steals.
Don't you think Tom's swimming too well?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went to fishing.
He was just a bit of an old man.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them fly.
It's all there.
What day is it?
Let's give it another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a normal guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Is that true?
Why don't you go in there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day he died.
Tom and I must stay together.
I've only heard about him.
I don't work here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
Don't compare yourself with us.
I saw that the car was on fire.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right for you.
I'll never blow my Pleistishn.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite telemedicine?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
It's Tom's birthday.
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid you're going to lose.
I like going to school.
I asked for help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for your son.
Her father seems to be a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm going to go home to him today.
They need you.
It's Apelles.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to worry about him.
The officer mustered up courage in his people.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like that right now.
I don't understand very well.
I'm going to make my first meal at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many zones do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
All of this has already been known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's gonna cry.
Mom, look what I found.
It's interesting what Tom was thinking.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw how he looked at you.
Tom was kind of sceptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I thought about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I wake up every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to let them go.
It's apple acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go to the fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
You're taking a job at home?
According to mythology, the Prometheus burned the holy fire to the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get out of the bus before he got burned.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than me.
There are many talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't care.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking the check.
My bike's gone.
The stars died in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.

I think you like it here.
I'm working on my imagination.
We've been very happy for a while.
I've never seen you smile.
Obviously you love Russian very much.

I bought something.
You're not going to go that way, are you?

How's the new job?
Why do you believe that?
I know a little about that.
Maybe I should stay in Boston for a week or so.
Your key to me.
How much do you need?
You see her, and where is mine?
It doesn't even fit under one category.
Have you ever saved a life?
How many words?
Are you ready?
Don't be me till half the third.
It's not the end of the world.
Their movement has been restored to a wide range of rivers.

Do you hear me now?
I didn't order it.
Is he sorry?
They trusted Tom.

As far as I know, he wasn't involved in this affair.
Fame was killed more slowly.
We don't know what Tom and Mary know.
I want to be happy.
You're going to lose.
We've already seen it.
How many knots did you buy?
We never give up hope.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
Even if I'm not talking about the price, I'm not going to pay.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think they'd punish me.
Write this down.
We didn't build it.
You'd better go help him.
That's right?
Tomorrow morning they sell tickets to Shakyry's concert.
It was better today.
I know Tom is a brave man.
I got married early.
It's not a joke.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom told me Mary doesn't want to go.
Did you talk to the doctors?
No one saw that.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
They all love money.
They went astray in the woods.
When was the last time you went?
I have a heart attack.
My father doesn't leave me in one movie.
I saw it like a boat tonnet.
Instead of going to work, I spent the whole day at home.
I'll support you.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not sold.
Who's your neighbor?
My father usually watch television after lunch.
He's drinking wine.
Please cut off your apple pie, I've prepared it for you.
I mean, Tom didn't understand the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make time if you get out now.
There were no special problems with Tom.
The darkness didn't hide it.
I invited him to work.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two tablets of aspirin from the headache.
You're in my heart.
He took me to the last copy.
Don't laugh!
Love doesn't blame anyone.
If you come to it now, you'll probably stop watching his TV.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't want to try them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made a selfi without a ruby.
In what kingdom was this church built?
We'll soon be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not going back anymore.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your glasses.
The rainwater falls on this tube.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of the girls who're more friends with guys.
Don't worry, I've got insurance.
He'll be here with me.
It's hard for my father to drink.
No one's offering you to take care of this.
He's been working in this company since Monday after the resurrection.
Mary forgot to stop the car.
I'm old.
Tom went with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call him tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who is he of nationality?
Tom sat with John in one room.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank a beer.
In our time, it's hard for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Tom, wake up!
I'll keep my nose pay.
I did what I promised them to do.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She went out of her way and called me.
Did you take your medicine?
The hunters are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
You like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
You wanted to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still worried.
You'll be better tomorrow.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of a flying giant?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom read Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I'm just out of my mind.
In Tom's patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
He's trying to escape.
You're standing up.
We're champions.

Tom said it wasn't enough.

I'm only buying a soft toilet book.
I saw Tom again last night.

Someone needs to tell her that.
I have everything to do.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in a room with his brother.
I didn't imbecile.
You're doing everything, right?
I can't heal.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
In 1857, Dinamit selected Alfred Nobel.
We have to get involved.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you don't have to do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical name of a bromostic acid?
We have a lot of money.
That's how to look for a boy in honor of his wife.
I asked Tom.
So you need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do this.
Clyvo!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was gone as a courtman.
I respect his views, even though he disagrees with many of them.
The sky is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls the baby?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the ground.
If only I could come with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't benefit them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't slow down in school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
You're planning on staying long?
We ate fast, and then we left.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're right.
Careful, don't touch anything on your feet.
Make every meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she do to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He's a village against me.
The cat was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you before I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They died.
The apples are bigger.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She's going?
I need to go to the toilet.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
You understand Tom?
Let's go to the car.
You're messing with me.
She was interested in what his loss would be for breakfast.
A good trainer trains this command.
The tree's sick.
The trip was delayed because of a strong snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What did you take that I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
It was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book?
It must have been you.
Mary left me in the bedroom.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you do?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask, Tom planned to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new suit.
Last year she learned to build a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out on the street.
I went to the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants were made from the elephant bone.
I'm not a kid anymore.

I bought this book.
Innovation is its only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of people.
The kid Tom lived in Boston.
I didn't eat six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She kept quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I've gone further.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very welcome, and she has a nice kiss.
I won't let her die.

You can't trust a machine translation.
She hit me, not him.
You don't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's a lot of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say, what happened?
You couldn't leave the door open?
That's what you're gonna have to wait for.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's two older than me.
Tom knows they were wrong.
A mild climate in Japan.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the wounded game.
Tom said he wouldn't believe it.
Our trip was very cold.
I'm sure I'm going to France once, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost midnight.
It's just getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped. You can open the window again.
I've never had that before.
I don't think Tom's gone.
I was going out when I called.
I don't have to endure it.
Always get in the way of the matter.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's good, but I don't like her.
I can fire you if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have this problem?
I never asked her.
Nothing gets so weak as a hot van.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You're not sorry.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice as a melodic song siren for me.
How's your husband?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why she didn't like Mary.
My fingers were left on the print glass.
Chemistry is remarkable science.
I feel that my French doesn't make it much better.
How can I get a passport?

If I had time to do this, I would.
You see Tom's boat?
Too big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
I have a bad life.
You know how I was involved?
Tom's turned out to be what he's doing.
Someone trust me.
She's a "Sex in Big City".
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Talk to him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ works, stop!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are a few interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's breathe here.
Are you in new bottles?
You can leave if you want.

You've often said that.
Here's a few letters for you.

I didn't want to tell you that.
I've filled my pockets with the whole thing.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house are you living in?
I told them it wasn't nice.
What do we live for?
Will there be rain today?
We know about her.
You could help us.
I don't drive a car very often.
That's why I don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love endings.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?

I'll sleep a little.
You'll ever be there.
Tom's having a good time with Mary.
- "You owe me money." - "No, you don't."
He came up and stood on his knees.

This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Did Tom do this for you?

Show me your collection of marks.
It'll take forever.
Tom's pretty much above Mary.
It looks like nobody knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?

It just sounds like it.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary in the church.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?

The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to taste.
Tom decided to buy a car in custody instead of a new one.

Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would soon win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't really like Boston.
She's always writing letters.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn to the left corner.
Tom taught me to do this.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I'm not bringing disobedient children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said, everyone was upset.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She showed up her talents.
I'd like that to be possible.
I guess you can't do this.
I thought I was alive.
Bob's next school party will play a major role for the first time.
You must remain in shape.
I hate seeds all day.
By the accent, I realized he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Be merciful!
Tom's down.
All my generations think of it the same way.
I live for it.
Can you fall on your lips?
He's ruling in many lands.
Well, they're happy.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's slowly getting excited.
You'll feel like home.
That's not gonna work!

I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?"
Get out of here!
If it's not selling goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get acquainted with girls?
Tom chose the coin.
Why didn't you go to your room?
If God doesn't, it's all allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to get married for him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything as well.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please step forward during the journey and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both love marine products.
I've been waiting for a long time.
I rejected the proposal.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't do it.
I have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing has changed.
You built all this yourself?
I'm with a lot of patience for the summer vacation.
Can we figure this out for another one?
He's looking very much from here.
Tree homes are easily depleted.
Let's get him to dinner.
He's still alive.
I want to go to college.
I know you're drunk.
Blood is very convenient.
I'll make this report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's down.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for him to come here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need it anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
All ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who made the meeting?
I'm such an innocent guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the hole.
What bird can't fly?
This has to be done.

I hate spinach.
Mother's preparing dinner.
Tom is a palmer.
What can I do?
Her son's a genius.
I know you saw terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give up his emotions.
We were forced to report his death.
Why didn't they leave?
I didn't see you.
You're just finding out clearly.
He had cancer.
You're guilty of what happened.
He's just like time.
I know where you're going.
You understand everything at the airport.
Let's blame him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do this.
I don't like it.
The fireman stopped talking.
On the writing table.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're no longer a hero.
Tom was a busy smoker.
Tom gave me the pens.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he'd be worried.
Tom's not used to that situation.
I'm wondering who's gonna help him get a snowflake?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family life?
What's that noise?
My son has a genetic disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a world where you can marry your dog.
The best protection is the attack.
She's getting married this week.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be better.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I had five avocados.
Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
What's life like?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What did you decide you couldn't do?
We went back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
With the mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this coffee?
They wanted evidence.
Tom's pointing his finger.
Tom can't get on a bicycle.
I'm not talking on TV at all.
Why did Tom walk away?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at the sun.
I spent 500 dollars a day.
Tell them to go home.
Let's put it where it's convenient.
They didn't make it in time.
Now seventy-seven.
I see you've fallen asleep.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs died long ago.

I'm so proud of it.
You were ready.
You know Brother Tom?
All the hunters can take off the eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got everything out of my hand today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
He only learned to drive at thirty.
I'm glad he didn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I didn't laugh that long.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to break the meat, so I used my traditional knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon be able to adapt to a wooden life.
Keep some water in it.
You're no longer a child.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all set.
There's a deep river here.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you a hundred times.
I'm so cold.
I'm sure you should tell him.
They died.

You didn't know I couldn't do that?
How did you feel?
Let's give him a chance.
I like fruits.
Tom did it.
He's selling cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he's coming?"
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I'll take it.
They shot at me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it.
Tom gave Mary a kiss.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first to get to the bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anybody know them here?
There must be a mistake here.
He can't let himself go.
I'm used to breathing.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friend's left with a stick.
Did you ever talk to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom's sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the blue is twice in one place.
I don't get tired.
Stay on it.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door uninterrupted.

I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
The rabbits are spreading fast.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
How much do you have to eat?

When happiness comes to your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.

Tell me clearly.
I'll get to what's gonna happen to us.
Don't you hate to make another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Gonollulu.
You don't tell me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom's gone last.
Tom signed an application.
Did you try to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She grew up in her innocence.
We don't know so much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me some time.
You want them to help?
Tom's not seen anywhere.
That's what I told him to come here.
Find out what they said.
The apples are the best fruit.
Can't you close the window?
There was no ticket in Tom.
In the near future, we can meet again.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a barbarob.
I slept in my life.
Keep me in the race.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she was buying it.
I'm ready for breakfast.
I'd like to buy two marks for 40 cents, please.
I'll give you a bike on your birthday.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
The beer is beer.
I don't think that's why I like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I want you to talk to him.
You kind of said she was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't be late.
That's what we're working on.
Are you all happy?
Tom's watching a video tape on TV.
We have to sleep on the street today.
That's what Tom showed Mary how it is?
Amazing, isn't it?
I cut the seed.
The school's gone in five minutes.
Tom put a bed in his armpit.
Is that the only thing you're going to care about?
Can you see the rose?
Mary tried to hide the tears.

I just need you to sign it.

Don't move.
Hey, it's me.
Now tell me something about yourself.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom is teaching my children French.
Tom says he hasn't been there for three days.
It doesn't look like Tom's happy.
There's some mess here.
I had to tell him to go there.
We're gonna finish it.
I know you're in love with Tom.
Dick gave me a photo.
You said you could help her.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
I couldn't see her face.
It could come up to you.
Someone sent us a gift.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, right?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked me for advice.
Tom started crying.
The day she's pregnant.
He'd never hurt me.
She wasn't sick.
I tried to be nice.
He's deliberately gone so he won't kill me.
You think I'd think?
Tom is a citizen of Australia.
You bought them?
Tom just looked at Mary and kissed her.
I gave them my old coat.
Tom called for Mary's help.
You released or a conservator?
We don't know exactly why this is happening.
The presence is mandatory.
He's got rid of Leila's computer.
There was rain on Monday in Boston.

I'm on a ten-hour trip.
I can't dedicate you to my plans.
I broke her.
That's what you said?
Tom and Mary know each other very well.
You bought a good coat.
The scientists explain otherwise.
What are you doing here?
Do Germans have other concerns in life, except for needs?
Does she have a brother or a sister?
Hey, what are you doing?
They're selling shoes.
It's a very expensive card.
Why?
It's my favorite project.
We don't have water.
Don't you want to introduce yourself?
Don't worry, even if I'm drinking, it doesn't affect how I drive the car.
Tom told me he'd stay home.
I lived in a three-room apartment when I was in Boston.
Don't look at this.
Unlike our school, there's a bus stop.
That's exactly thirty.
Tom's got a circle.
"Oh, I'm dying," said Peter down on the knees.
After I was on my way home, I noticed that I had lost my wallet.
How long have you been dead, Tom?
Are you playing guitar?
We hope we don't have to do this.
We're under control.
Who's there?
Today's payday?
It's obvious, it's inevitable.
It's your fault, not me.
I wanted everything.
We'll do it tomorrow.
Shut up, you're so hot.
Don't trust him.
Which search system are you using?
I was afraid I'd never do that to anyone.

I couldn't do anything for Tom.
I don't think I would.

I thought Tom hated Mary.
I'm a Japanese student.
You don't have to do that.
Well, I think it's time to tell this story.
I haven't been drunk for years.
