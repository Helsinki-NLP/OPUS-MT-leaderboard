In Estonia and Spain, four members of the Kemerovo Group were appointed
In post-majority data, the police in Spain arrested the leader of the Kemerovo group, who was active in the country, Slava Gulevići, who is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
In Spain, Gulevish was arrested on board.
The Court also ruled that three suspects were arrested in Estonia.
According to the suspect, the action has been carried out with the members of the Community of Kemerovo, who are 27-57 years of age and who are mainly involved in drug abuse.
In Spain in the province of Malaga, Mijas, the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested.
In Estonia, three persons were considered suspicious, one of whom was collected as a criminal Community leader and two were members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the duties and roles of the criminal community were clearly removed.
The purpose of the criminal action of the Community was to introduce drug abuses and thus serve as criminal income," commented the Head of Criminal Procedure, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We are not surprised that the circle of suspects in that criminal area is increasing," said the prosecutor.
This has been done with people who have also been subjected to the interest of law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been convicted of drug abuse.
Blood stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become common to us, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," Dr. Verte commented.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Crime Police Office, said that the arrests had been pending for almost half a year.
"In the first half of the long-term realisation of work, and at the same time, we held the suspicions of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
He added that the Central Crime Police officers were assisting in maintaining their position in Spain.
For years we have had good contact with the Spanish police and civil society.
These arrests are the following messages to criminals that we will get them from another part of Europe," Leis said.
The information already collected indicates once again that suspects may continue to commit new crimes in the course of their release, so the prosecutor requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man in Spain is waiting for his birth in Estonia.
In this criminal area, there are spare items, vehicles and lock-downs for the purpose of guaranteeing the confiscatation.
The criminal proceedings are conducted by the Central Crime Police Office and is conducted by the State Prosecutor.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court found Slava Gulevish guilty of exhumation and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevish was considered to be a second man in the criminal world in Estonia after the mayor of the Toona, Nikolai Tarankov.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Gulević, from Cameroon, was raised in the south of Estonia when he began to deal with pressures in Tallinn.
He also paid taxes and prostitutes to different hotels, and demanded that businesses pay tax from each other.
International co-operations, confiscation of criminal income and enforcement decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgment, which was cited as the eight Offences of the Criminal Code of Dikajev, convicted of a criminal offence amounting to EUR 80 000, or the judgment of nine persons in 2006 that Igor Aleynikov committed a criminal offence against the Community, which was aimed at illegal trafficking in secret rights and the imposition of crimes relating to human trafficking in the East and South Estonia.
There is approximately EUR 71,500 in the amount of confiscated crime.
In these criminal cases, police have made it possible to exchange information and evidence daily with extra-colonies and, where necessary, to carry out any activities in the country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group maintains the travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned Missouri of the discriminatory policies and racial attacks of the country's black people.
The Group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel mark issued on the part of the country of Missouri, which will apply until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be present in the whole country, particularly cautious and extremely cautious, taking into account the full range of serious serious events that have occurred over the last time and also out of the country."
According to NAACP, the Group urged the issue of travel care to be issued both by the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to combat discrimination in cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the objectives of the country's correctional targets are equally large.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They will be dragged to the tea bar because of their skin color, they will be beaten or killed," NaaCP Missouri Hare President Rod Chapel told the story of The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received so much complaints before."
This is a first warning that the organization has issued to the US country.
The group referred to events such as racist massacres in the direction of black students from the University of Missouri and Tennessee, 28-year-old Tory Sanders' death.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he was taken from the country by a gas station and was taken by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri shows that in the country, cars of black car drivers are stopped by 75% more likely than those of white people.
"The mark is designed to make people aware and to warn their family, friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready, then, to take up the pipeline or to inform relatives that they are passing through the country."
On the basis of the latest data from the FBI hate reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015 which is based on the country’s number of similar offences in paragraph 16 of the national law.
Travel management is also a response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for the company to appeal to the court for a living or employment after discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had issued earlier travel notes on Texas and Arizona since these countries adopted immigration laws, which forced local people to commit crimes against immigration, as ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually provides travel assistance to other countries, but in recent times interest groups have begun to use this measure in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Hepatitis: What can each one know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis may be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses call for the liver to get a quick shot.
However, there is a chronic hepatitis B and C that can continue to develop liver cirrhosis, perhaps liver transplantation, and liver transplantation.
The Health Agency’s epidemiologist Kulo Kutsar says that acute liver diseases are the same for all types of liver failure - fever, fatigue, fatigue, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache, headaches, skin rash, skin rash, skin pain, skin rash.
The recent outbreak of disease also results in the popular name of the tax collector.
In children, hepatitis may occur without any symptoms.
The different types of the liver can be determined only on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis may pass into chronic hepatitis and walk for decades without any disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his risk of illness.
Hearing Kutsar comes out of different forms of hepatitis and describes their cycle closer.
Hepatitis A viruses spread disease from the human body and enrich us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by washing people’s hands and hands for food, dishes, objects, water, and drug use.
Family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver disease, people with diabetes, men with men who are sexually active, drug addicts, people who visit countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
Vaccination may be avoided in vaccines, in particular for many patients travelling and for patients at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements: wash or wash your hands before you have to wash all your clothes and clothes.
Hepatitis B virus spreads disease in human blood contact, injecting drugs, tattooing, inhaling, using blood-ungered agents (babyars, radiation devices), with dodorives, hepatitis-sexins and hepatitis-likes to the liver/sudden.
The risk group for hepatitis B is involved in the injection of drug addicts, pregnant human sex partners, men with men who are sexually active, pregnant mothers who are disabled, family members and caregivers, blood and other caregivers who visit countries with high-performance hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group and in addition to chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
The prevention measures for hepatitis B are: the prevention of the use of iron hygienic and manicure products, other surgical instruments and injection needles, the use of tattoos and needles, and the use of condoms in the event of pregnancy or the prevention of sexual use.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunosuppression plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses spread disease in human blood collection, in the injection of drugs, tattooing, austerity, in the use of blood-sustained agents, in dodorives, in hepatitis, and in hispatitis, in the breast/synthesis.
The risk groups of hepatitis C infection include drug addicts, infected human sex partners, men with men who are sexually active, pregnant mothers who are infected, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other patients who are involved in health, rescue workers and police officers, people with HIV infection, and visitors to countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: the prevention of the use of iron hygienic and manicure products, other surgical instruments and injection needles, tachymia, and the use of condoms in the event of gastrointestinal use.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
D hepatitis causes hepatitis D virus that increases hepatitis B in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D is a hepatitis D infection in chronic hepatitis B patients with hepatitis B or superinfection.
Hepatitis D virus spreads in patients with blood and other body fluids, contaminated with insulins, in a congenital way and rarely in hopes of breast-feeding.
The risk group D of hepatitis is chronic hepatitis B virus inhibitors and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
The effective prevention is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D infection.
E-Hepatitis virus spreads through the national-regional route of diet and food, including a few hot-treated animals, fish and oranges, dodorives, socialised injections, and dried-up mothers.
Travellers may be affected by high hepatitis E in countries.
The prevention measure for E hepatitis is to comply with the hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after taking a toilet before preparing and eating after the disease.
Pre-consumption of fruit and vegetables, avoid the consumption of low-fated meat, fish and seaweeds, drink only safe food and avoid the use of drugs.
Although in the last round the competitors tried to force the four-fold Olympics across the border, 34-year-old Farah was able to win the final battle and won at 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long after finishing up with his wife and children, Tania.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be with them," said Pharaoh's journalists.
In London, Farah picks up a gold doodle from 5000 and 10,000 feet [5,000 m] of titanium.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
In spite of the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor "Dadam's career. Gustav Klimti's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait" is a unique story of one of the births of the artists, marked at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century in the culture of Vienna.
But it's a more profound story.
The open-ended information store may have a lower cost, a tighter theme, allowing you to gain more influence on the special content of the portrait, which is allowed in the booklet.
There would now be just two books between the same canon: Gustav Klimti and his country's "Dadam Street" story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and note the wider and more historical history of the historical Jewish and German occupation, along with its consequences in Austria.
The first three books of the Bible present a steady stream of popular wine culture and one that has reached the head of Austria, can at least be hard to imagine how more than a hundred years ago life in Ringstras around or how all of you had to come back to the center when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one wealthy city in Europe, and in the name of the book, the feeling of fame was even more grammatical.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was working in a city where he could be a drug addict and had the European highest level of self-sustainment was not enough to create a development.
Or maybe - every parallel painting adds color to the culture of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Union of Travel Travel Councils
In the last decade of the 19th century, a large number of Jews had grown widely in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
In the middle of the century, every tenth of the population of Vienna was Jewish.
And Adele’s parents were new immigrants in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself two times to open up the Czech sugarcane to Ferdinand Blochi and Klimti for the country she heard, his father had already had a large bank to become a bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adele's whole glamorous life, where she's been, didn't end up.
Looking at the "Dami Christmas" is hard to believe that at the end of life, it was a great lady's socialism and the trip from the Council's Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to give his wife a portrait of Klimtil, he was the last hottest artist in Vienna.
At that time, the loan would amount to 4,000 kroner, bringing the price of the land to a good location.
It's that for some portraits, our love model was questioned, the sugarcane was not damaged.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that a model and a close relationship with the artist continued to last.
Anne-Marie O'Connor--"Come on.
Gustav Klimti's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer portrait special story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randma.
Just before the start of the work, Klimt had gone to Ravenna San Vitale, and the researchers believe that the mossies seen right there in the middle of Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a gold portrait from Adele as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daim Street" in 1908 and about the same time (the years 1907-1908) was born in another gold country.
Two women in the arts did not remain unmarked.
How's Hitler connected to the building?
"I think that my friend Klimti's memory I owe him to make his work available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after leaving the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family to go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimtil had prepared another portrait of Adele.
Also, in his trial (Adele left in February 1925), he asked his wife to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt's hometown of Austria Gallery.
He turned his noses over to Mary and Louise for dinner.
A year after Klimt had finished "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to access the 17-year-old Adolf Hitler Academy of Fine Arts.
Although Hitler is sometimes considered to be a later antisemitism because the Jewish professors did not take him to academies, none of his explorers were actually Jewish.
In any case, Maria’s role as an Austrian Galleri in the test was markedly changed by 1939 - it was important that she found work for the Nazi party from the rich Jewish art churches in Vienna.
Some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimti's.
Sixteen years after the Nazi art movement, the 10-year meeting between the Austrian Government and the Bloch-Builders began.
There's only one indication here that if "Sudden" is seen in the valley of Vienna in Belveder, then Adele Bloch-Bauer will have to look at the journey to New York New Gallery.
And before Viin's trip, he read through the above book.
Even if you're looking at Klimti's work I'm not planning to go, because at least my emotions were disturbed after the book was closed more than $135 million for the country and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So, not as much as portraits, as longer as a generation's history - and very moving story.
Significantly, in events, orientation was facilitated by the seed of Bauer produced at the beginning of the Bible.
The 17-year-old widow in Canada was very close to the Estonian record
In the presentation, Gold was very close to the personal record of 200 m of the settlement itself by walking 2.16.62.
Tippmark is a 17-year-old from a long week of membership when the Canadian Junior masterminds were awarded 2,16.58, Priit Aavik's Retirement Blog.
Gold reached the last 10 days, maybe the A-final.
At the end, he crossed the distance at 2.15.76 and reached a total of seven places with a new key line.
Alina Kendzior, from the Estonian record (2.15.13), was released a few seconds ago by Gold.
In Estonia all the time forward, Gold rose third, and its fresh personal tipping mark is the fifth result of all the time in Estonia.
The young future holiday in Canada is still at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m, and 200 m and 400 m complexion.
Last week in Toronto, Canada's masterhouses took place, and Gold made a successful start there too.
He won 200 m in release at 2.03.22.
It was so quickly taken by Estonia last year in 2008.
More quickly than gold, in Estonia, this distance has only led to Estonia's record as Elena Partäka.
In his life as an Estonian, he won a 100 m pronks medal with a great personal record and a new Estonian driver with a 56.66 tip mark.
For example, from his age, Kertu Ly Alnek has made this distance more than a century earlier.
He arrived at the personal tipmargin in 100 m in circulation by sending a note in the notice of departure at 1.03,69 hours.
The distance from the distance reached all seven times when the wind ended at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian guest furniture at four different distances.
President Trump is going to rest, critics are on the streets.
The time for vacations is in hand - that also means a break for US President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been the first president of the holiday, critics are already on the rise.
U.S. Today and CNNi have a 17-day holiday at the presidential holiday in the own golf club in Badminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday started yesterday, Trump's responses to the holiday topic have already taken the weekend.
They're calling Trump before you get too much rest.
The names of the President are usually due to the weekly exchange of time in their villages of Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
At the museum, Trump is no longer the president of his office during his 196 days.
For example, George W. Bush was able to have already 67 days at this time, Barack Obama but less than Trump, but only 21 days.
But then it's time to forget things at Trumple.
A few days after the presidential appointment, Trump said he had "60 minutes", so for a long time his agent would not stay, since it's a lot to do.
He also announced three years back bad Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote toona on Twitter: "When Obama is on vacation, he plays golf, walks on the streets and on the J.S.S.S., he's going after the newspaper ISIS."
There is no 17-day golf club visit to the White House officials for a vacation.
It is officially referred to as a job vacation during which the time to read or to other memory activities is not available to Trumpil.
In addition, there had to be another reason for unemployment.
The name is replaced by the White House in the western conditioning system and therefore the entire staff had to leave it.
In the western part of the Ovaalkabinet and other presidential offices are also located.
"I don't think that any of you would like to be in the west in August if there are 38 degrees and no conditioner," said the White House spokesman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during the vacation.
From where President Trump's going for 17 days, you'll get a brain video.
Blocking critics from Facebook don't apply to the state office if you don't like the criticisms of the voters
Our country's father was aware of some of the illegal media attacks.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long before history that he began to mock him for the most part from internal politics until he came out of his political principles.
Of course, she was affected by the crisis.
But he didn't force his critics to change.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "the freedom of speech can be taken away from us and, in the dark and in the dark, it can lead us to the fates of the Roma."
It brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to see it hard to be more like Washington.
Hogans have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And for the first half of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU appealed to him for trial.
The Kuberners officials were impressed by the empty and web comments were taken from the response style "Who cares?".
"It's the most Facebook," said many.
But it does.
And it smells a lot when it's about a man like Hogan.
The fact is amazingly surprising in a democratic country with a populist cybersex.
Its percentage of approval is in the position of 50 Governors of the country in a different place.
Hogan is not an unintended reactive poison.
He has led the country in a certain way and has left his principles to be accurately established.
In addition, he has used the main tool in dealing with his voters in a somewhat wrong way with Facebook, for example, after the first time he had a severe headache from his skin.
It is therefore a public forum with official marking, which manages the payrolls of taxpayers to block the people visiting personally in an unnecessary and finalised way.
The interview with President Amelia Chasse protects the conduct of the Kuberner for The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture on the web of mobile Internet trolls, explosives, or angry people.
The Post was dealing with a lot of people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they are, people who are dealing with their chosen leaders, a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were scary, over-examined, and not a lot of noise.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, stressing Hogan to the Catholic Church.
A lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, was not upset about the hatreds.
"I tactfully commented that I have been deceived because he has not responded to hatred and other recent news," he wrote in The Post's commentary.
"But I don't like the idea that when a strong person comments on the same subject, someone immediately calls it a collective effort, instead of acknowledging that it is much of a concern to citizens."
What the cybersex official called "sudden pumps" would be called "alternative aid".
Facebook time allows messages to be easily adapted by blocking simply criticism or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than the old one, where workers were sent out to do the same, that they would gather together with critical leaders and burn them or silence the protesters and force them to disappear.
But exactly what's going on right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for the abuse of Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trumpi has been charged with the trial by Twitter users who have blocked him from Twitter.
One of the first significant decisions on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the former Council of the Guardians of the Republic of Lithuania had failed to improve the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked his selection from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter after the use of Kuberner Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, there was a similar effect on tax-related postal costs as well as on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, a series of historical and anonymized writers clarified his way of governing.
And even then, Washington's anonymous trolls had to be put on the line.
People wrote to historians a letter under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belarus, and Portius, making decisions in Washington.
In accordance with the background documents compiled on the project of the collection of the books of George Washington, he reviewed the premises under petitions that he criticized his position on the terms of the agreements on friendship, trade and shipping with Britain.
But he didn't force them to move.
Freedom of speech, opinions and discussions are at the heart of our country.
And the right management means acceptance.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to the convenience of the Renaissance Club's home territory
The last European President, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for the rest of the territory within the next three days when East Lothiani Renaissance Club golf courses will take place on 25. Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Hemisphere, who was in the Archerfield Linki’s last round in the nearby year prior to Paul Eales’ subjugation, has stressed the new location and fulfills the role of the club’s founder and director, Jerry Sarvadi, as a tourr.
"As soon as Rennaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club is going to run with this company in complete darkness," said Rafferty.
"The players see the race in their best form, it's in a cold state.
Jerry's done a great job on this place.
He's a golfer in the back of the game, and he's feeling threatened here.
This enables the radar to be presented in a great way."
English Eales is looking forward to the first time he will be able to protect the master's daughter, even though he has won both the European Tower and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It makes a very special feeling," said Southport's pessimist player.
"I couldn't defend my Extramadura Open title, because it took years after my winning contest calendar.
Magic is coming back to this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, it was a different war last year.
It was a very special time, which we will always put in our hearts."
At home, Gary Orr, who joined the European market at the beginning of this year, also joins the competition when he reaches 50.
This is his first venture in Scotland since his participation in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always more important," said a man in Helsinki, Orr.
"You can do well, but you also feel extra effort.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've shown quite a regular golf course.
I'm at peace with the past."
The trip is accompanied by an ex-Master's tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the tour of the region's tour champions Paul Broadours, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Captain Orr and former Ryder's lawyer Sam Torrance are two of those who have been fighting for two months, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmüir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and car parking is paid to one passenger car with 5 cars and two or more passengers with 10 cars.
All revenue will go to the Prostate Cancer UK charity.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold mine in the country
If Bardina Dege is preparing dinner, she doesn't use the pill.
He's using a lot of time.
In Indonesia, the province of Papau, the province of Panai, in the capital of the province of Enirotal, puts the native language of the batata, which is called a local note, directly to the future.
A half hour later, the wounded will be taken from the other side of the vessel and put in the hands of the unwashed hands of the wounded.
Degei is sitting on the other side of the street without a furniture, and there he is also doing his daily household chores, such as washing the sand from the nearby spring of the rain.
The role that we've played is that we're gonna have to shut the door.
Since she is the younger of her husband than four women, she is not appointed to take care of any field.
Polygamy is normal here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the men who have worked and many of them are severely beaten, and there are still soldiers here.
"Don't let anyone laugh after who's five o'clock in the evening to go around," he says.
It is a rare sight to live in Papau in the capital. It is with the former Dutch colony, which was linked to Indonesia since 1969, with a referendum that led to the greatest of 1026 adults to vote in the face of the forces of the people.
The movement of the Dutch superpowers was speeding up its borders against the Jakarta Government, which continues to maintain its strong control of the region by keeping out the external journalists and human rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into the province of Papaua and the West Papaua, so that the island was part of the island of Papua New Guinea.
To reach this destination, you need to fly 90 minutes from the province's capital to Nabires and then cross the five-hour drive to Nabires.
There's no joint transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of trees surrounded by grasslands and cut down by legal wastes from the lakes, which have been transformed into branches of various gardens.
Very few Indonesians have taken the initiative here, regardless of the journalists, and have not gone to almost all foreign countries.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, our Pago popes worshiped the divine name Uga Tamee.
I've made other changes.
"We haven't used to wear such clothes," Degei says, referring to his colorful hand-made handle to the turban, to the dark flux and to the first seal.
"Before we put it in there, we only put it on the farm."
The pope is the poorest province of Indonesia where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and the statistics on child mortality and literacy are one of Asia's worst.
But it's also an Indonesian gold mine.
More than 100 km from Pania, which is about 153,000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is the world's largest and most successful travel trip to Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport alone stole about $3.1 billion worth of gold and silver.
In addition, Papaua can be encouraged with consumer goods worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these crimes are the source of the plague of the popes, because they require a warm place in Indonesia's army.
A 2005 study of The New York Times showed that Freeport would pay approximately US$20 million for local military and military personnel in 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one commander.
The efforts of the pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold and move around with them in a loving manner.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 popes have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
In the Asian Human Rights Commission's data, the mass killing of genocidides occurred in the Western world in the 1970s.
Last year alone, more than 3300 peacefully protestors in the Indonesian police area were arrested last year.
The 2016 report "We lose all" in the main section of Birsbane contains reports on events, such as judicial executions, torture (in particular, violence and the provision of electricity) and the reduction of the power of peaceful media.
"The number of victims is hard to read, because such incidents occur every week," says researcher Andreas Harrison of Human Rights Watch of Indonesia.
The Kravids are still strongly rejected, as Papaua’s natural resources have caused new entry volumes from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the population in the province of 3.5 million are Christians, but democracy is changing, because from Indonesia's national borders, Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi Islands, the Muslim economy migration is coming from the border.
The family members of the district are selling gado-gado with cattle and cattle, which is served with the ground floor.
Locals can't fight them.
"Migrandians began to sell cana and the traditional agricultural market from local populace," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to the province of Jayapura.
"The Popes of the Holy Fathers of the Mother-Mama's will therefore lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi, allowed his 2014 election campaign to address the violations of their inequality and human rights in Papua.
In his way, Jakarta won the Presidential Pope's 29 election from the 27 electoral district, including Panai.
But the Paphos has changed very little, and locals feel that they are being deceived.
"Our hearts are broken, as in 2014, we voted by Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfill our expectations regarding the restoration of justice," you say.
In fact, Panai was in need of a lower position two months after taking Jokowi from October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 of the children in Enirotal were singing at the end of the day when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the darkness.
The children who met told them that they'd have to sneak in.
According to the case of local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers voted on their vote and later married with four soldiers.
In the words of the victims and the superiors, soldiers ran behind the children and beat them with their fists.
Then one of the soldiers shot a child's jacket.
One child, 16 - year - old Julianus Yeimot, was so excited that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the upcoming election committee was set up to burn down and the next day, it was still on the scene.
About 1,000 young Papau men, women, and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to ask for justice.
They wore ceremonial janitors and presented Pope with a dance dance that ran around and traveled to the village hall.
Some protesters began to attack the police and the military.
In the wake of the attack, an order was sent to soldiers through internal radio. "If there are more than three times the opposition, let them go," said the official document, which has seen the history of TIME, but which is not issued to local media sources.
The city of Kego Koto, in the city of Enirotal, in the old town of Jeremia Kayam (56) felt threatened and called on peace to be maintained, asking the people to go home.
Nobody wanted to hear it.
"When I turned around, I was shot in a black box," he said to the newspaper TIME in his original colors on the wooden floor.
We still don't know who the shooter was, but it says that the moon came together from the soldiers' ranks.
"The crowd was a lot, a lot of hard work," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was able to shoot him three times on the edge of his nose.
"I went to him and examined his body to believe that it was with him," said the newspaper TIME in a group of Johns, who uses only one name for many Indonesians.
"As if he's dead... I'd kiss him."
The chief officer of the police, Yotje Mende, told the reporters that his troops had returned the security of their department only because they had been attacked.
"We must protect ourselves when we are threatened with death," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo, President of the Pope's Police in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
Human Rights Watch's data killed five young protesters and were severely injured.
The following day, Jakarta arrived in Jakarta only for the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura held a speech in a church where he declared compassion for the families of the victims and allowed Papapa to deal with the charges.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never repeat again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he established a judicial mechanism to address crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately followed the excuses.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have dedicated ourselves to solving these crimes, but we must follow a certain process," he said.
In his talk with Time 5th of June, Jakartas took his words back, saying that he had no intention of creating a Papapas mechanism for complaints.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been charged with crimes against human rights by the United Nations in connection with more than 1,000 people died during the 1999 blood referendum in Ida-Timori, said that 11 of the crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including the incident in Pania.
The families of the victims adopted such claims with suspicion.
"I've heard four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," said John.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, there's still fear.
"I'm afraid," she says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm being shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the Panais people are afraid of this interference.
He said he got a soldier's hand back after he had helped four victims get killed.
"After the slaughter of dead bodies, the soldier came to find me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On the second day, the Indonesian police raided the visitors of Pania in the neighboring region of Deiya.
One man died and 17 was injured, including children, when he spoke to the director of the visitor and construction company, who refused to inform him of the hospital transporter.
This 24-year-old Ravianus Dowüw, who climbed a fishing boat near the shore, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry visitors protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the visitors ended up with police stones that the last of them had met with arrest warrants.
But locally, the mobile Brigade (Indonesia Military Police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great pressure, we were afraid to receive taxes," said the 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lived near the hospital and saw the introduction of the diseases.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai Parliament has requested that the police be held responsible and the return of the police mobile Brigadiers from the region.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of an estimated development contributes to the disillusionment of the mind, the teeth and the teeth of the dallicles living in the central world of the pope.
Many of them have joined the Free Pope's Movement (VPL) forces, which defend the rights of the pope in their own words, in order to organize attacks and human rights violations against the Indonesian soldiers in the event of an attack.
Some VPL presidents are from Spain, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, in the wake of the military "protecting the sovereignty of the country" in Spain, thousands of people have been detained in Spain over the past few years and have been detained voluntarily.
Some of them never appeared again.
In the pope's presence, Panyas is known as "the tragicly forgotten."
The disease is eating restlessness.
The small rice sold in Enorotal is too expensive to buy locally.
The lion is the same.
People grow all their own food mainly by means of battalion, as well as a little fruit and vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women who are able to care for four or five battalions.
They usually take care of most of the sick in the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten battalions pay only 10,000 Indonesian meals (75 cents).
Over the course of time, economic imbalances have increased between land mines and new migrants, which have been achieved extensively since the opening of the Nabire airport.
These small jobs, which are available, are closer to educated and more powerful migrants.
There is still a lack of capital or skills needed to develop a highly competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in leaving because there is no job or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Council.
The transfiguration preserves the eyes of the world from the Paphos.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on the foreign media.
At the beginning of this year, the French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Longchamp were sent out to the Pope, because "they did not follow the relevant customs", even though they had been given a rare film permission.
Human Rights Watch Asia’s Deputy Director, Phelim China, has not indicated that Jokowi’s electoral permits to lose transparency and development restrictions imposed on reporters.
"In Indonesia, the most peaceful provinces in the Middle East and the East-Papapa Republic of Indonesia threaten the new dangers of turning back and placing a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of a clear picture of journalism means that international stress is severely limited to the Indonesian government with the pope’s closest relatives.
In March, six Pacific States of Tonga, Nauru, Belarus, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "a number of widespread crimes" in the Papua, including the shooting of Panaii.
These countries have supported the VPL in the past as well.
President Arrmanatha Nasir of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia rejected the Group's charges, saying to the journalist Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic regime and the freedom of the press, so that the evidence of cases against human rights would be difficult to remove."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation visited Kees Van Bari on 4 May, Jayapurat visited the country's human rights agent Kees Van Bari, the local people came to the meeting, but in an anonymous manner, to be left behind by the source of their passion, asking: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the pope does not believe that they are voting again by Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Panai," said President Hobai of the Council of Events.
He wants Jokowi to understand that in addition to living under the constant threat of a vicious war, the people of Panai are suffering from the threat of nuclear education and health services.
In Goba, the people of Panai, like the other popes, must pay their vows to Jokowi.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and threats, Panai’s families were allowed to enter the country against which the last victim was killed by the police and the military base.
Knowing that justice never ends on the feet, they will not at least let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a broken hand.
"What else can we do?"
I've come to the Dubai Torchi vigil for the second time.
It came on foot through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, causing hundreds of residents to flee from this 337 meters high and 79-class buildings.
This is another damage that has been reported for the last two years from a high fever called events in Torchi or Tävikutornik.
The house was evacuated, no infection was reported and no direct damage was reported.
"We slept and opened a fire alarm and people's wrath.
We would walk down the stairs and spend about 10 minutes on the 50th floor," said Reuters, a resident who named himself George.
In the words of civil protection officials in Dubai, firefighters were removed about 4 o'clock in the morning (00,00 GMT) and washed their bodies.
The government said they were working in the name of a major threat to suffering.
It may also raise questions about the safety of materials used on the surface of high-speed outer space throughout the world.
In a study conducted after the fall of 2015 of the Torchi Board, it was found that the most damage was the external decorative panels and isolation of fascists.
The British police have said that they believe that London Greenfell Tower isolation and façade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of future damages that occurred in June, with about 80 people injured.
See: from these phones, they are probably getting heavy sales tickets
There's a lot of time for technology professionals, because then telephone manufacturers publish their new models.
In the summer, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were sold, and in the winter there are new hot phones waiting for players.
According to you2, Kristjan Seema, the marketing and marketing director, Kristjan Seema, describes today’s innovative design, eye-browsing interface, a 4K-service resolution, and an overarching process.
A great learning took place in the technology world in Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also come to Estonia's new telephony table.
Süggs also allow the inhabitants to continue to load out faster, more resistant needles, higher quality cameras and higher water and tortoise.
He added that on the basis of the hearings, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four models that are likely to govern the current sales tables.
These four new phone tips are still available to the pools in the winter of this year.
Remoteed iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should be reached in mid-September.
You know what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do, it's going to be a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not significantly differ from iPhone 6s, the 10th birthday of Apple is expected to be entirely different from the previous one.
There are four colors: black, white, red gold and chrome.
One element of the new design is apparently a screen that captures the entire phone show, lost the door door, and the camera browser is built into the screen.
Apple's designer JohnnyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a glass.
There's also been a physical version of iPhone.
In addition to the eyeglass scanner, the driver’s position and the higher quality camera, A11 processors can be expected.
I'm sure it's an unexpected phone call for a year.
The introduction of the new model Galaxy Note 8 begins on 23 August.
There's been a lot of stories about the new Galaxy Note 8 going on.
Understandably, there has been an increase in the number of entrepreneurs, and S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is a lawn and the other with a narrowed view of the telephone.
Now no one knows what two-way cameras are capable of, but anyway, it's the first Samsong test, which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 on the side of quality.
But we'll be waiting on Friday, August 23.
Although Nokia has sold three nuttelphones this year with Nokia 6, there is still no link to them - Nokia 8, which is already presented on 16 August.
We are waiting for instant 5,3-to-bess screens and surfaces of Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and the most resistant acutes.
In the case of nokia, it is also mentioned in the aluminium body and in the significant volume of water and tortoise IP68.
In contrast with Samsong, Nokia has a new model of two-way cameras, which the optics produce company Zeiss.
If Sony is sure to have a link up to the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future, at least two new phones are added, with even more innovative functions.
We're waiting for a new phone that's a little more flexible than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculating that this screen is at least six minutes late.
What actually happens is that we can see the right head because, traditionally, Sony has released his deep-fashioned flag at the international technology era of IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
In the case of phone-related transcription data, Trump Mehiko was concerned about paying for the limit
The Washington Post published copies of telephone communications between the United States President Donald Trump and the Heads of State of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to President Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico, to end the last public preaching that he was not planning to pay for an exemption.
The President of the United States spoke to him after he was publicly convicted, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump insisted on his presidential campaign's commitment to build a long southern coast of the United States of America to make Mexico pay for this project.
The transcripts were also published from his first address to Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a slow exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement by which the United States of America takes fugitives from Australia is "naerful", "nair" and "room". He said that the agreement made during Obama's government would be remembered by him as he has proposed a refugee residence ban in the United States.
Trump stopped calling, telling Turnbull that "the day was the most unpleasant time of the day."
The State Court did not take a review of the complaint from the OÜ MRP City Lines in which Tartu withdrew from the offer in July 2019 to 2029.
This is the order with which the OÜ MRP Linna Lines rejected the offer to the Tartu bus project, since the offer did not meet the requirements, explained by the Director of the City Law of Tartu.
This is the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines filed a decision of the Court of Justice of Tartu.
The State Court has not taken this action.
Although many in the social media pretend that the weekend of the festival is disturbing their night, and the whole city is full of long hours, so there are many who do not have to say any bad words about a long festival on the beach.
I've even been positively surprised that the sales were so smart!
I didn't see any shame or uncertainty.
I've even seen a way out," says the Queen Laine.
"It's good to come, be it, and feel the joy of Pärnus, who's as cold as you've left the winter," he happily adds.
Rannast cost the stupid Laine and don't worry.
While in the middle of her life, she still heard that music was playing in the market, and now music has not reached her home.
"When I hope I hear," she says happily.
Agnes, also speaking in the evening, says that there is a better time for Pärnu at the large festival - it will help the local shopkeepers to walk.
In addition, he rejoices that the so-called so-called So-bean has come from so many countries.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Of course I'm not on the beach anymore, but it's good that the beach is alive.
And it's good that the people move, and it's been three times that way," says the woman.
For the first time, it must have been worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he thinks.
But it's the kind of music that's happening in the area, in his words, is a habit for the people of the South Pacific.
"This weekend is a very good promotion to our small town," says Harry, a Parisian poet.
Love and love didn't spoil his life.
But for what?!
We should all keep it together.
Consider how this international relationship would be better.
The choice of music from a man doesn't make it.
It doesn't matter, even if I live near it.
"Good people can keep together and no harm," he says.
The visitors who came to Pärnus are wise in his words.
"Of course, they've gone a little bit too, but the young are young and the Lord God - let's go, but be people and we can do it!" he says.
At that time, seafarers have traveled from place to place to relatives or acquaintances.
"Even though the festival has a positive effect on the lives of the guests, such a smile likes," says Pärnus, who spent with the children of China.
Also, his family and festival music did not disturb him, even though last year it cost him much more than today.
Last summer, there was a lot of noise, so we heard more.
We live out of the city itself that actually costs far away from Pärnu's river very well," he says.
Pearson is still running 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to restore the company
British education company Pearson rightly said that it would attract 3,000 more jobs and reduce its average income by 72 per cent by launching the next restructuring programme to solve the threat to the company's stability.
In addition to the 4000 staff lost during the previous restructuring, they will be able to use jobs, which will be set up by John Fallon, with a high likelihood at the end of 2018 and by the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced in May that in the framework of the third cost reduction programme, further 300 million dollars (394 million US dollars) were spent in order to try to restore a business that has been made for fast digital learning due to the transition.
A company that agreed to sell a month earlier in the company of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsmann, said that their expectations for the year did not change after the 1 % increase in sales was reported in the first half of the year of 2.05 billion loans.
On Christmas Day, the summer sun will continue to shine
In Estonia on Sunday, the winds will suddenly appear, the winds will be very strong.
At night there will be a full explanation in Estonia.
There's a lot of trouble going on around here, maybe it's too late.
It speaks from the east and west of 5-11, covered up to 14 islands and on the coast up to 18 m/s.
Air temperature is 13-17 degrees.
The day must be marked by interpolation.
Several times it gets worse, it's possible to move immediately.
Speaks further from 6-12, cleared up to 15 islands and on the coast up to 20 m/s.
Air temperature is 18-21 degrees.
Contestation Kabulis: NATO Army Self-Protection
The former bomber, speaking to officials in Afghanistan, killed one NATO soldier and wounded a number of others in the capital of Kabul.
In NATO's statement, five soldiers and a translation were injured.
According to local reports, three civilians were killed in the city of Qarabaghi region.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have been committed in Afghanistan this month - the second day in the Herat Mosser generation has killed more than 30 people.
On the first day, a suicide bomber in Kabul killed about two people in Iraq.
NATO's statement said that a four-day explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army attacked "with a man-made fire."
The statement states that all of them are affected in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military airport outside Bagram.
In reply, the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic Republic (ISIS) are constantly growing forces for the forces in Kararabagh in NATO Bagram.
In the first half of 2017, data from the United Nations have killed at least 1662 civilians in Afghanistan, approximately 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the area of the rivers.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a large bomb killed more than 150 people in the middle of the country - it has led to the greatest deaths in the country since the United States broke down the United States as of 2001.
This violence is undoubtedly a security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US forces involved in the war and police.
Correspondents have claimed that in the last few weeks, self-reports in Kabul have led to the same public confidence crisis against the government, its policies, and particularly President Ashraf Ghani.
Following the expiry of the Decision, the EEA Joint Committee adopted a decision to suspend the Regulation
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) repealed the decision to speed up the establishment of the Obama-time regulation, which obliges the parties to limit bone-based exhaust gas one day after the 15-party complaint was made by the Agency in the course of its proceedings.
The EPA notified its decision to continue on the three-day day following the "Actions to determine the content of 2015", saying that it would show the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States parties.
"We believe that we must engage in dialogue with our partner countries and listen to them," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Prutt had been informed in June of the EPA's intention to avoid the determination of the component content, which is measured in different parts of the country, in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the strict air quality standards.
The 15 main democratic parties, together with the region of Colombia on Tuesday, made a statement that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trumpi's Government has tried ten times to reverse several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have led to resistance to democratics and natural protection groups, who are concerned about increasing the impact of pesticides on people’s health.
The EPA website says that the introduction of air in the room "may reduce the working capacity of the brain and increase the risk of respiratory disease", for example in asthma.
The German cigarettes can come in.
In Germany, it may be observed that strong winds threaten the European Union's reputation with a second producer of lead, Bloomberg writes.
Today, it can be said that the long weeks before the arrival of the harvest may mean that the seed that is meant to be a plant may only be eaten by animals.
"Our quality is far worse than mine and stronger than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen, analyst Bernhard Chilla.
Today, up to 40 percent of German animals can be eaten by cattle, which is twice as common as in the Agravis prophecy.
German agriculture, as well as their European colleagues, have today been affected by any wind.
At first, it was too cold.
Then came the ice, which in June replaced the heat lamp.
In July, Germany won the gold medal, which was also held in August.
Many eyes have been turned to North-East Asia, where the wind prevents the arrival of Christmas.
So far, only five percent of the lead has been used.
Most of the region has not yet received the advantage of achieving it, informing local partner, Ceravis.
"This is a very complicated day," said Ceravese's ex-trafficker Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency at any time, perhaps, of the species of wild domestic animals
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the Mexicans, as the large lakes reach the shores of the Sea in many (life) rooms.
Every step begins with the effort of our fundamentalists to create equal loads as well as perfect (energy-saving) homes.
It is also valued as a building material, furniture and laundry for the production of wood for the use of wild animals.
Remarkable take-offs and nutrient solutions are found in the meshs, both the builder and the (home) designer.
It must clearly show that the combinations of black, white, and adhesion, if they are complemented by woodtops and floors, can be very pleasant.
Good ideas can go fast for another week, because the mess lasts on August 13.
Consumers and orphanages tend to experience a common experience in this field.
From today’s tenth anniversary to the weekend festival Baltic and Martin Garrix left behind everything to remain in mind as the last speaker.
When Garrix was present, the people were really turning their backs on music, dancing, and dancing on their own.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was lit across the city from the Parnu coast.
We'll take your gallery, where there's all the pictures that our photographer has been trying for three days on Weekend.
You must be some of them, too, looking for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss potential opposition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be at the coco-circuit course to respond to the nearest posimachi in the near future to 66.7 kg of potassium category, met the first time on Thursday.
They were at the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, until Garcia, the unconquered World Boxing Council, followed by a corridor on the other side to greet Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Organization's closing ceremony.
Following the victory of the first four-year world champion, Dr. Adrian Broner, given the outcome of the single decision of Garcia, will be the first of the two winners in the showtime table.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you doing, Chemp?
I'd like to help you."
Lomachenko protects his sword against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19th ESPN.
When a few photos were taken, Lomachenko, manager Egis Klimas, noted that there would be a "real measurement" between combatants.
"I'm an old shutter," said Garcia.
"I moved up for Broner [up to 63,5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63,5 pounds small.
I want to move down the stairs.
And he has to move over the light rock [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
Let's offer them that."
The Lomachenko's consent.
"The pox-world needs this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether this should be the case. It is part of his strategy that he wants to debilitate Lomachenkol at the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class in order to make the next possible meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knots), which is equally interested in combating the fight against George Linars and Luke Campbell's battle against the easy-to-famous title race forum that took place on 23 September.
"Looking at the struggle could be a challenge because the fans have wanted it in return," said Garcia, later saying that he is open to the fight on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are fundamentalists.
No other name can pay so much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he's gonna have to be "a brave fighter" Lomachenkot, and he can go check on his daily ride.
But Lomachenko was kind of back in thanking Garcia, saying that from his mind he saw three masters from Riverside, "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted to stop it."
Garcia said that it was the purpose of showing gravitationalness and then posing.
Both confirmed that they knew how much pressure they had to carry on.
"It is a struggle that awaits realization.
On the other hand, no one pays so much attention and attention.
I'm more than ready to do work on that name," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's a good fight."
What world powers are being promoted in Estonia?
It extended and issued a record of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have successfully traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
If, for example, Il decided to grant a temporary residence permit to a foreign country 6702, this number was 4928.
Officials are unable to tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be made in the Ministry of the Interior.
When about 500 Ukrainians were taken back to Estonia ten years ago, this figure will reach almost 2,000 in the last few years.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased dramatically during the Ukraine crisis - in 2014 the temporary residence permit was received by 1087 people, 675 years ago.
According to the Statistics Office, the highest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia has reached 850 Ukrainian citizens more than the rest of Estonia.
"Ukraine society has been big in Estonia all the time, and because of the complex values, it is natural in the country that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where society and many families are already in front of it," said Prime Minister President Kristin Rammus.
The majority of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit were even greater than the number of citizens of Russia, although during the ten years the most recent residence permit has been issued.
If Ukrainians come to work here, the citizens of Russia will be forced to leave.
"In view of this historical Russian society, they probably also have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helena Maasing, the Ministry of Internal Protection.
"If you see where Russian citizens have moved to live in Estonia, then after Harjumaa there is immediately in East Vietnam," he added, adding that about 40 percent of them have married the citizens of the European Union.
Mulu received a temporary residence permit in 1696 for a citizen of Russia, who is also a record member.
At the same time, the number of foreigners wishing to extend the residence permit declined greatly.
"It is appropriate that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence in Estonia," explained Prime Minister Rammus, who has said that the interests of Russian citizens have remained stable for years against Estonian residence permit.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia will be granted to foreign nationals who have lived here for at least three years from the previous year.
The aim is to encourage the adaptation of people.
For example, a long-term resident’s residence permit is expected to last five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also been reduced after the new residence permit.
For example, I was granted a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians are now able to exchange work and the Estonian state is no longer closely following whether the wage criterion has been met.
This right of residence was granted mainly to the public - to the applicants - to me the passport owners (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (36).
In order to live in Estonia, they were allowed to live in 1968, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians, and many Chinese people.
With the first half of today, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
For ten years, it has been a wonderful country from Nigeria, whose citizens are one more active applicants for Estonian residence.
When three permits were issued to the Nigerians in 2007, I received 200.
We're going to learn from Nigeria in these universities.
Estonia's high schools are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased dramatically thanks to the students.
They also apply the rule that a community has been set up, where it is easier to approach others," in the Annex to Rammus.
For ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example from North Korea, as well as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals are granted a residence permit per year, it is approximately 0,46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we think of the citizens of the European Union, there is a gap of about a percentage," Maasing commented that there are actually few numbers.
A total of 14,822 people were interviewed by the Statistics Office in Estonia, but 13,792 were present.
This means your sister passed out a second year.
Most of the outside and inside schools are Estonian citizens, but most of them are outside.
As a result, the Estonian population was reduced to 2,000 people.
In particular, the Estonians cross the border between Finland and Estonia.
Mother Couture's prints are missing seats, tickets and chairs
However, for Maria Tammeor, there is a history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream of a few hours in a museum and dream of old clothes and clothes.
If you do something with a letter, you'll investigate and learn about it every day.
It's a discovery!
The glamorous world of Mom's Couture may show some life-threatening, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how hard your life is!
I've got a friend who's got a whole bag full of my built-in leather suit.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go to a red baby every day, he also wants to wear them the most beautiful clothes and wear them!
You can live your own life as special!
The artist does not recognize the gap between the events of the strike and the day of the war.
That thought made it even harder to get high - tech ways in Estonia between the lands, the forests and the rivers, to people who don’t get to the top.
For example, Mother’s collection was presented by Võrus, Jõhvis and Pärnu, where 45 models of royal grace filled the whole day.
In Tallinn, it is often taken in, it's taken in red, but there's more emotions - crying bravavo, standing up, wanting to thank you for your hand.
A lot of the audience came up with it, but now they're Mommu Couture's fans.
If you're beyond the expectations of people, they're inspired!
And I like it feeling like I'm with my molluscs right in the suite.
We had a 50 - foot - long [50 m] red baby, all the beautiful clothes in full, as if they wouldn't end!
Maria also doesn't recognize the need to present the plant to the supermodel, she happily brings normal women to the valley.
I often invite my own customers to the bathroom - they've always come with pleasure.
It's such a wonderful experience, you can keep in the woods in a wonderful bed!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my presentation myself, I've always been on the floor to give the most reliable perfectionist move on things.
My nose wouldn't be allowed to look around on the floor peacefully.
Mary is this kind of guy who doesn't just want to play the role of the representative, but he's the one who's been in it all the time.
I've got a studio in my bathroom, most of the collection I'm doing myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you find it.
I'm never far from my creation and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not about design, it's about stylists, logistics, organization, organization - it's all about a temperature woman's day.
It's not that these hours of work have to be a lot of fun for the fans.
I can't say when my workday ends, it's just a day full of joy for me!
I'm still very excited - it's like an endless happy time: I'm doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and even a little bit more complicated.
How many times have it been said that my clothes have magic - they put themselves in the prince's office.
The strange blue satiries that Mary's heard above the talent have remained the signature of Mother Couture until today.
Martin Müürsapp U18 boys: Estonian Alagrupturnir gun now turned against us
Oh, my God, the mummy's gone.
The first thing was that we couldn't get our table.
And when the song comes in so big, nothing to do," commented Eesti U18 Corvilles 61:75 to the United Kingdom our only NBA played corv paluler, BC Kalev/Cramo abitreener Martin Müürsapp.
The response took 28 bullets from the attack and received so many more attacks.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive protection or attack, it broke.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, and we couldn't build up our defenses.
They were able to hold each other, but we couldn't combine.
It put a man's feet under it.
The response was better done at home.
According to the Mürsepa estimate, Estonia had to make more tactical mistakes in order to remove them.
Last of all, we had a zero mistake, but you've already got a few quick shots.
An apocalypse and a sharp move, which was our weapon at the subterfuge tournament, now turned against us all.
Today we had no power against their aggression.
The Mürsep left with his care of Kalevus, Mattias Tassa.
The tournament is generally able to tell good news about the whole team, which has been in a single lubricant.
I'm sorry you've already met with such aggressive resistance.
Tass was always on his own and was playing out today, but he seemed to be tired - he's wearing a lot of weight.
But he did some wonderful movement I've seen in the training before," the guide added.
Bad numbers: in the case of a flood, the EM tournament has dropped with three waves less than 10 points...
In the U18 age class, not only young people from the EMI B division in Tallinn, they started over in Dublin.
And the Eesti game of Pooga played a lot better in the field of anti-corritory.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49 maybe only in the last ten minutes, they took their feet from the gas station, and the period of production was week 16:16.
Both first and second in Estonia 4 third 1 point...
This time the Estonians first met with two minutes with four of the first two pieces of whiskey, but then the game went 25 pieces, then one third in, and then 21 more letters...
Maybe in about half an hour, you've got one of 47 whiskeys killed.
In addition, 2 out of 4 were released.
The pallet count was a reasonable number at this time.
The end of the game was the 33rd and Eestil 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses. On the open day, Portugal's 83:56 improvements were made.
NATO vessels came to Tallinn to add equipment
Today, NATO 1 has been granted a permanent shift to the planned port visas in Tallinn to complement the ship's equipment and prepare for future operations.
In the course of the voyage, ships make preparations for the landing of the sea and then give members the opportunity to rest on the afternoon.
After the visit, NATO ships in Estonia to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future search operations.
"The participation of Estonians in NATO's units and their local knowledge of co-operation is well demonstrated by our integration with Union forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa, captain of the Overwhelming Operation and Planning Division.
Since 29 June, NATO is headed by the Permanent Military Group of Latvia, Captain Gvido Laudups, who has taken over the mission of the Séremonal Group in Russia on behalf of Captain Johann-Elías Seljam from Estonia.
The LVNS Virsaiti, which also operates a group leader, is designated for the Group’s flagship.
This half-year is also part of the association of the International Union of Estonian Marine Ministries, Sakala.
One of the four groups of ships under NATO’s maritime leadership is a permanent unit of preparation of NATO’s 1st group of primary air traffic controllers, which may be sent to various parts of the world within five days of the alliance.
4 - 13 August, the memory of the pirates will be re-entered again, where they will be held 13 years ago by the Master Eri Class, invited to live in the Birgitta Festival.
Today's Birgitta Festival, Tallinn Philharmona's artistic leader, Risto Joosti (36) can be beautiful, powerful and unpretentious.
Risto Joost: The audience of the opera world's classics "Traviata" and "Tosca", the ballistics of "Boleros" play "Karlssonini" and there are no plans for self-production, which at this time was the release of Joseph Haydni's wonderful oratorium "Years" by the same international creative team, who in 2015 brought the Pirital valley of Haydni to the other masters.
Birgitta Festival is more than just concerts and theatre contests.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival where the light takes power and never let it go.
Because the experience gained by the listener in this superior and secret environment makes sense to people, and it is not impossible for humans to describe it in a way that is impossible to describe.
Risto, you're the first year of Birgitta Festival's artistic leader.
Didn't Maestro Eri Class feel a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, there has been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire course and supported me at the beginning of the course course.
Maybe just thanks to that, I've got to keep doing his job.
Eri Klas has been injecting the Birgitta Festival team so many blessings and it's naturally going to pass on to me as well.
It was great to join a team that knew how things were going exactly.
It's just that Eri's big heart also gave me the strength to go on with Tallinn Philharmona in Birgitta Festival.
And here I am and I can do it!
What could make the audience present at the festival what special offers?
We have an artist from England, Latvia, Lithuania and a surprise to present to the museum the first ball of Astrid Lindgren's story.
That's what Karlsson's flying for.
And one of the sad stories about this is that the author of this ballet is Lätt's hero, Juris Karlson, who expressed his desire to write it.
Apparently, he's already got the character of Karlsson.
Resto, how are you all of this?
Thank you very much for my support to the living room.
Such work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I am happy with it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend on so many other people, as much as I do on myself, or on how I go against every new day.
And such a conscious maintenance of the structure, maintaining the positiveness and actually laughing at itself in the morning, made a significant increase in my happiness.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it in particular and it works.
Instead of laughing, the brain activates and increases output.
It's not just a dictionary.
I think people still don't know half the things about their body that the universe offers to them, but everyone finds it to be equal.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any ritual before the director's desk is set up?
Still, clothes have to be exchanged against the most comfortable.
It's just a little bit self-repudiation.
But generally yes, I don't have a chance to clean up or do a little bit of trouble before the big show.
In fact, I even like to have an active relationship with people even before the start of the course.
But come all over to Birgitta Festival, here's what's to find out not only the big opera and the ballet friend!
Look at your favorite videos with Risto Joosti!
New results were published for the assessment of the ageing of Russian asylum seekers
In Sweden, a test was performed by asylum seekers, which assessed their age with a new medical approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the tests were estimated to be older than 18 but not all of the results were accurate.
The Swedish National Court of Justice (Rätttsmedical Network) initiated tests at the beginning of this year.
The tests were based on a more accurate assessment of the age, following the criticism of the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrating Network) that they have not been able to accurately determine the number of alleged minors.
Currently, the Migration Network has sent 6880 cases and the Court of Justice has issued a total of 2481 test results from the mid-March 2017 to 31 July 2017.
Twenty-ten per cent (2002) was assessed as 18 years old or as older, and in 25 cases, the Court of Justice assessed that the test "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
The tests shall be used only if the person's age is below the threshold.
According to Johann Göransson of the Institute of Justice, results are consistent with the previous six properties.
"We don't see much difference compared with the previous six statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said in The Local Journal.
The fact that most of the cases were considered older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued a May 581 test results and said that in the case of 442, "I refer to the person being 18 years old or older".
But when historian Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of the 581 tests, it was clear that in 243 cases, there was a direct claim that it would be 18.
This method of medical age assessment, which is carried out by smarter rhetgenoids and irradiated MRTs, which will allow them to be analysed in babacharts and radiologists, has been criticised in some areas.
One of the doubts is that the Karolinska Institute endocrineologist Claude Marcus, who is one of the employees, is the assessment of the human biodiversity in order to clarify whether they passed the normal puberty earlier or later.
"I've had reason to think about it and I don't think that the measurement method that is currently used should be used.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say exactly, then we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the history of Metro.
But Johann Göransson, the Institute of Justice, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can generally be said that the risk of neglecting an unborn child is small.
The biggest maybe around 10% is at risk if the person is a bit below 18."

20-year-old ex-wife Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut in London's MMil, sending a total of 67.37 to the 18th floor.
Orel was a young woman of MMI, and a happy woman assured her that she was looking forward to fighting the medals in the future.
The hearing went well, and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately removed my average result, and on the second (62.80) I risked too much and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," said Orel after the debate.
I've been looking for mine, and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli MMI ended up at 18 p.m.
The cold Orel was not upset because he's already training snow through the TTU station.
"I'm hurt," he said to the little one.
In London, the Olympics were almost full of people, did Orel find people around her or could she throw herself out?
I thought, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it's giving up. That's right!
If you fight yourself, you can try it.
Orel confirmed that the MMI will remain at peace with the debate, and he is waiting for many more good competitions: "I came here today with the last of the 32rd anniversary, I finished at 18.
It's a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil - it's the only thing that's going on.
I'm taking good experience, and I want to fight for the medals in a few days.
West Virginia Kuberner reported on the partnership
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced that he would change the parties by meeting with President Trump during the four-day evening evening.
"I like it or not, but the democracies walked away to me," said the Governor Justice.
"This is what I tell you, having prayed hard and then thought... today I tell you, Westerners, that I can't help you as a democratic Governor anymore."
In the harvest, the harvesters were joyful.
"That's why I'll be released tomorrow," added Justice.
"Treenina, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised to collect a great deal of information in the former West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionth of the country's Forbes data, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he belongs to the five countries where he belongs to his father.
His value is about $159 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Classes (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that the "Cuberner Justice Partnership is next to a democratic party which would be more likely to prevent the country from ever becoming better than working on its behalf".
"The most recent mention of 15 cybercrime and control of the lowest number of countries in history - the knowledge of cybersex Justice is simply the latest statement to the party, which is a direct guide, and cannot find positive and consistent messages," said RNC in a statement by Ronna McDaniel CBS News.

Coe thanked the guests for their generous forgiveness for the Doping Canal
In his statement, Sebastian Coe, an international army officer, thanked him for the four-day Doping Canal, but once again, it is not time to allow the country's sport back.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, on behalf of the Russian army, said at the IAAF Congress, prior to the World Championships, that his country was right and that he had a firm intention of fighting against the agreement.
He asked for forgiveness "from all the light bulbs that have been pushed off the gold and silver medals in the contests."
In spite of his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the force of the dispute, which was established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Discrimination Agency (WADA) report found evidence of the State's support for the agreement in Russia.
"I think it was a very nice response today, very nice presentation," IAAF President Coe told the journalists.
"The Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russians also acknowledged themselves that they had been quite complicated and that they are doing their best to reorganize the region."
In addition, Coe said he was pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and is taking place, but the Congress supports the proposal of the Working Group that it is not the right time to return to Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything possible to normalise the situation in the next few months.
We have always come from the principle that we want to separate clean sportsmen from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian lighthouses meeting the difficult criteria of the IAAF are fighting in London's series of light bulbs as neutral sportsmen.
On the first day of the IAAF Working Group, Rune Andersen said that Russia was not responding to the multiple elimination criteria.
Following a proposal to the IAAF Council, he said to the journalists in London that there is still insufficient and forbidden training is still free.
The revolution of electricity cars significantly alters the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Less than the fact that the revolution in electricity cars significantly changes all fuel prices to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although complainants like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place to another, it is not helpful for smaller complaints firms.
Glencore is currently serving in coal and oil but continues to grow cobalt, lithium, left, aluminium and ignition.
This year, decisions by the United Kingdom, France and the Government of Norway have increased contributions to the distribution of electricity cars, which allow hundreds of people to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels.
Sestatap has already learned Volvo that they are planning to release from the internal combustion engine and Tesla brings to the market more model 3 electric cars.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, over two decades electric cars will be sold more than oil-producing cars.
"It's all going to change about some metals," said capital Economics raw materials analyst Simona Gambrain's Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as copper and lithium, which demand has grown for years.
In electric cars there are about three times more heavy than usual, reported Glencore.
More weight is needed in loading areas, so the price of Exane BNP Paribas increases by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric cars means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore will receive rising electricity trends from low-cost prices and that it is the world's largest co-cobalt producer, predicted by the Jefferies Group.
This company is estimated to be the other winner of the power exchange for Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is reacting to the trend that has already changed.
Today, 70 per cent of London's metal bar is falling.
The result was 37 per cent.
Also, the fat has increased by 14 percent today, mainly because of economic growth.
Glencore's share increased by 20 per cent in London, with a high rate of overstated Rio Tinto Group, BHP Bilton and Anglo America.
On the part of the losses, companies such as Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to the new era.
The most basic end-use is the cars starters equipped with petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars shall be used for alloy circuits.
"This is a serious risk to the steel demand in the event that there is another demand that could overcome the decline in demand," said the Bank of America Merrill Lynchi, director of the metal market analysis by Michael Widmer.
In addition to the impact of the assessment, there is no indication of the adverse trend.
More than 17 per cent of the oil is today, where it is the most priced metal in London of the main industrial metals.
Investors will see problems for metal in the long run.
"I'm not sure that the plate is so bad because oil keeps traditional cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of Triland Metals.
If the oil demand falls, it'll happen slowly.
Maybe it's going to happen about ten years later.
In the past, however, the stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid vehicles, which depend on the often built-in auctions of motor vehicles, is assessed by the international flag and the flag research organisation.
Cottons like aluminium are replaced by steel, as the easier the car gets to drive with less electricity.
This has already been explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7% of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is probably getting worse, Widmer said.
Aluminum has now increased by 13 per cent since the growing demand for car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
The teratologists don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motor to use nanotechnology for the production of black cars.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a more flexible soil to resist aluminium.
"Sustainable space should be the answer to this development," said exane BNP Parbas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
At the end of the naphtha season, suffering may also lead to platinum.
I spent about half of this wrong metal engine for car catalysts, reported the metal refinery Johnson Matthew.
"Many raw materials such as oil and platinum today are not likely to have a great demand in the future," said the Natix raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials become less important, but their importance changes over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers will continue to believe in a requirement for diesel hybrids.
Uncore's leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid vehicles were sold in more than one full-powered cars.
The high expectations of platinum producers for 10 years are toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos developed by cars based on the water cycle, which depend on the platinum to produce water electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"The other looks like a clear waster on the side of electricity cars," said Exane BNP Parbasis from Brunet.
The German car manufacturers were able to participate in a large refurbishment since the Stuttgart court banned the use of a diisle in Mercedes-Benzzi and Porsche.
How the Rules of Finance affect the transition of Neymari to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unencumbered consumption of European football clubs do not prevent the world-wide transition from Spain's football license to the Paris-Saint Germain Paris Club in Barcelona, France.
Whatever the consequences of UEFA, the governing body governing the European game and whose power is to ban participation in the Presbyterian Masters' tournament, Paris is expected only in front of Saint Germain.
UEFA’s financial rules (FFP) set out in 2011 mean that PSG must at any time prove that Neymari’s transition was financed without damage.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million (262 million) for the sole reason that the Brazilians would buy its contract, and the Neymari reward will start to extend to $10 million a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer to the French Club of Neymari.
The PSG has no doubt been able to buy Neymari and to add to its vast fishing effort, taking into account that the team is funding a family that manages the Katari energy crisis.
Clubs are allowed to spend hard enough to steal players, but they have to compare it with legal inputs that allow them to come out of the football field.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that are making progress in the search for great debts actually act with fraud and risking redemption if banks or owners should resign from support.
From 2011 onwards, the FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the FFP bonds.
This amendment means that the model of business used by Roman Abramovich first in 2003 by Chelsea's - to buy a potential club and then make a lot of money so that the team can better change and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which will last until 2018, clubs may incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platin was decommissioned in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, has still dedicated himself to preventing excessive consumption.
"The FFP has certainly not died and we continue to strengthen these rules without any doubt," said The Associated Pressle Andrea Traversso, UEFA's FFP monitor last week.
Although the PSG's compensation for Neymari's surplus is a full payment, it is possible for them to allocate this amount for the purpose of accounting for the entire duration of the contract.
The five-year agreement was concluded by Neymar, so it is possible to demonstrate the transition to the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the next five years.
For the first sentence of the FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dabbel, was brought to a severer punishment with Manchester City.
The PSG estimated a fine of EUR 60 million (now $82 million) which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club demanded that the Overseas Group be restricted to 21 players instead of normal 25 in 2014-2015.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to design regulatory financial institutions with regard to their inputs through companies related to the owner of the club.
The company of Qatar may sponsor PSGs, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market values, UEFA would not be allowed to take this into account as an official income.
It happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the support of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was exceeded.
It has been said that a certain part of the Neymari PSG service may come from Qatar through the 2022 World Maritime Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 argue that Neymar could be sent to a world shipping company and claim that the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is still more prudent in relation to any attempt to eliminate rules.
On Thursday, people will be aware that UEFA has not previously discussed the transition to PSG Neymari.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition that they will ensure their anonymity because they have not been allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that PSG has benefited from over EUR 10 million in 2015-2016 at around EUR 542.4 million.
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymari’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship, trade and trace selling.
The club expects at least 30 per cent increase in the conclusion of the contract.
In Spain too, having been clearly disturbed by the departure of a major football player, Neymari tried to prevent the transition, claiming that PSG is breaking the FFPs.
"This is a clear "financial dome" event with the club and the country," said La Liga President Javier Tebas Hispania, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenali manager Arsene Wenger, who is a member of the American sports club, shares La Liga's concern that the country pays for the club.
"It is the consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football industry over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the game, since the country may have other ways or interests to represent such a large player's country."
Norway’s oil company has a good tradition to put the airport on the map of those who have moved across the country and have been inspired by others, writes Trip.ee.
With the expansion of Norway’s operational geographical scope, there has also been an increase in the number of people who have served on the airport.
For example, there is Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo, and Miguel de Cervantes.

Today 50 years ago: Orcanian storm in Estonia, which rescinded houses of ruins and buildings.
The storm of the century, which took place on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage to the Western, Harjuma and Raplama, in particular.
In Estonia, during those days the wind was more than 30 m/s.
As my old man walked through the lake, one cut tree pointed to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and quiet, like the world.
At the same time, the houses had already been destroyed, and in 2002, elderly Linda Kurova was reminded of the interview given to the Estonian newspaper Loodus.
Linda's husband saw how he met her in the neighborhood.
But what do you still support with your hands where you can resist such a storm?
The sea came under the roof, from the window of the water in," said Haapsalus Kalda, who lived in the town of Linda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the fall of the railway perroon was 20-30 metres across, Linda saw most of the snowflakes only the next morning.
Locally, there were trees behind Paralepa on the ground, some completely long, some on the other side.
Everyone seemed very tired, the storm came out of beautiful old trees with a ragin and a pragina like a war.
In August 1967, West Vietnam was not able to suffer particularly severely compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was even greater, wrote the Virumaa Witness in 2007.
The castle of Losipark and Padis Park were blessed with land, but also our giant parks were severely damaged.
In Tallinn the wind was measured at speeds up to 35 meters per second, or approximately 130 kilometers per hour.
In Tallinn, Meriväl, there was a little pictoritis at 6:00 a.m. saying: "Mama, Mom!
Canada is in the air and can't get down anymore," wrote the Viruma Witness.
During the storm, the house of Pöjli, located in the village of Viljandida, was destroyed so that it was decided to be repaired later.
In August, the construction of the tower of Tyre was not to be rejected, which was no longer restored.
On 12 August 1967, the newspaper Red Jet wrote that the cleaning of the towns and villages of the towns and villages of the towns and villages is moving forward gradually and that the inhabitants could be involved in the work of the road.
Tormis was also severely affected by agriculture, and the newspaper reported that "participational organisations must be both at work and at farming and as a source of encouragement and direction".
Orcanians can be said if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The clean wind record in Estonia remains on 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured the wind at a speed of 48 m/s.
Only on the island on the coast of the Mediterranean, so the measured wind speed could not be accurately recorded there.
The secret of the pure sopranos: other uses and weak coastal soil
The lower rivers also mean the lowest use of Tallinn in the soils.
"If there is no, then there are people on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people," says the coast guard.
In the north-Tallinna Stream, there's a lot of kisses on the beach.
They offer melodic competition on low-low-end tractors, which will blow down the flat trip.
In fact, the last seven centimetres go deep through the river, fixing off the coast and the rest of the people: bottlecocks, cigarettes, and others.
People still come on the beach, whether the water is hot or not.
If it is beautiful, there are people on the beach, and if it isn't, there are no people," says Mr. Aleksandr Usov, director of the maritime traffic management company Haberst.
The clock is 6.30 and the line is running hard, because by the time it's eight, there's gotta be a place for people to be okay.
It's four hours ago.
After Stream, he keeps his eyes on Pirate, Harku river, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pickari.
The thresholds have been reduced.
Years ago, it was a lot more.
People are now able to evaluate what is done for them," says Usov, who has spent 15 years in the race.
Before it was so, when something new got started, it was already over the next day.
Now we're gonna keep what's on the ground.
Net margin price
One of the greatest works in Estonia's neighborhoods is the safe cleaning of the seabed or the cleaning of the adrum.
For example, on the shore of Pirate, this sea oar must be transported to 400 000 tonnes.
"It's an incredible amount," says Usov.
The second major category is whether all that people leave behind.
A half-kilometre of Stream is a maximum of eight large dust container needed to be cleaned three times a week.
That's how it's going.
However, the colder winters have meant that the spring is less than a fifth.
The third type will form wastes.
Most of them are children.
In the meantime, Usov's fleet has excavated dozens of model cars.
They'll keep the owners waiting for the next five frames.
"It's usually going to get more out, but it's normal." Believer already knows that soon he'll find them again.
Children come to the beach and take toys to put them back in the truck again.
In short, the width will be extended
Erica Scholler, representative of Haaberst Management Services, points out that tractor traffic is disturbing locals.
Müra, which lasts for hours and nights, disturbs the lives of people living in the neighborhood and.
It's work today, but it's not possible.
Once a month, the line has to go through twice.
"If we don't do it, then the city section will punish us," says Scholler.
However, the objective is similar to that of Pirate, Pikkari and Pärnu, to get the electricity chain under the quality label of the international blue flag.
"There is much more work to be done in Estonia than with Europe," says Scholer.
We've got more courage and strength, and we've got harder to fight.
However, there are fewer dust in our surroundings than in other European countries.
On hearing that a survey is being conducted on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach, will be sitting in the audience of journalists and users, bringing to light the current sites of the beach.
There's a nice picture every morning.
The problem is with birds and dormant hunters, who have been bitten by the pirgic," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to imagine that people can change their old behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will take something to do with the garbage dumps and, for example, put the rocks on their feet to prevent at least flying back there.
However, Martin is generally at peace with the development of the beach.
It's obvious that the city's taking care of it.
It has become more pleasant with outdoors, lit and freshly asphalted.
Sometimes it was so that the wheelchairs could only drive one way," says Martin.
Artichokes found in Stromos: coins, only coins
In the morning, a 40-year-old Dimitri has been removed from use for a period of several months, which is the age of the metal detector.
He doesn't believe that there's no value in the future today or in the future.
The seas are not good enough for this.
"I've been doing this for years, and I haven't found anything valuable yet," Dmitri reports.
Hobiaardic acid is a few euro coins, bottlenecks, and also dangerous laughs that are later rumbled.
Usually, there's still mountains.
"The gold, the rings and the other strings are not usually not," they say.
Bank of England maintains interest rates by 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be informed that interest rates remain at an even higher level, as the rise in growth and inflation have slowed down speculations regarding growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains a snare, as long-term incomes from households have given rise to interest rates for waiting.
The Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) policy makers voted in favour of the 6:2 of the 0.25% regulation and at least the members require an increase this month, as long-term growth has weakened strong growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank narrowed the growth forecast for 2017 by 1.7% and by 1.6% by 2018 and warned that stress continues to persist in the entry areas, as inflation is still expected to rise by 3% in the winter.
At the same time, the Bank noted that the increase in the amounts is necessary for the management of the inflation from Brexit over the next few years and that the financial markets may need a higher rise after the expected cost of loans.
Members also voted a year later after Brexit was released by the partial withdrawal of the marketed maternity package.
The Bank concludes in February an interim financial scheme providing funds to banks, although it said that it is now expected to hold 15 billion euros in the form of a larger bid, with 115 billion in the form of loans.
In the Protocols to the Decision on the Limitation, the bank states: "In the medium term, the MPC's overall economic product (SKP) remains a force in the near future, as the difficult situation of real incomes in the households also has an impact on continued consumption."
On the basis of the figures, it was decided that in order to alleviate inflation, it is necessary to "pressure some of the financial policy" and to extend it "increasingly" to the extent that markets are expected.
Bors is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and the second rise in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any holes are astmal and restricted.
The low growth forecast for this and the following year is 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the May forecast.
An increase of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained.
After that, the loan was lower than the price for the dollar and the euro.
As less than 0.5% 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes has resulted in a recent decline in growth indicators, which have reflected growing expectations for growth in GDP growth in the second quarter over 0.2% over 0.3% over the previous three months.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain in the third quarter at 0.3%, although at the end of the year, this is going to be somewhat urgent at the end of the year.
The Panga’s freshest inflation report gave rise to inflation and military payouts in the hands of the disabled, saying that the situation is getting worse before the improvement is even worse.
It was added that the monetary policy could not prevent revenue from falling within the next few years, but at the end of the three-year forecast, a remarkable recovery of wages is expected.
Due to the low noise, the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for the lower consumption of consumers, also strengthens the economy.
The decision shall take effect one year after the reference to the amounts received in August 0,25 % after the shocking EU referendum, resulting in a sudden deterioration of the voice.
It will probably take four years for prices and the economy to speak fully of life.
Before the last decision of the bank was to feel a growing demand for the increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the stress in the dry areas; in July, three policymakers demanded a rise in the rate of 0.5%.
Inflation decreased by 2.6% over the previous month, compared to June 2.9%, although the bank's message was unexpected and in the next months the rise is expected again.
The bank said that too much growth compared to a 2-percent target was due to a completely weak noise.
Coreco, head of mortgage creditors Andrew Montlake, said: "In view of the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming ever more competitive, as employers are tired of work and are looking forward to a positive end of the year.
It is particularly encouraging to those whose current transactions are going to end, as refinancing, often service and low rates have become more popular."
NHS has been reported in 10,000 people with HIV-resistant medicines
Since September, patients have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a high-level battle on whether NHS should be financed.
NHS England reported that national healthcare now provides an estimated 10 000 people at the beginning of the three-year clinical trial with a pre-filled pen (PREP) - a tablet administered prior to the mid-term and showed a high-risk reduction in bone marrow cancer by approximately 86%.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the year in which the NHS was able to pay for the PREP, despite its claims that the medicinal product should be financed by local governments at the end of the year.
NHS Director of England Simon Stevens welcomed it on Thursday as "new massive intervention", while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. In October, there will be more clinics before the programme is launched in England in April 2018.
The anti-coagulant profile (PrEP) is a combination of HIV medicines, which is taken prior to intervention to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the spread of HIV among people with kidney disease.
Taking PREP before the interval means that the human body has enough of certain medicines to prevent the spread of HIV.
Such medicines may be taken every day or at least two hours before the interval.
Homosexual men, transsocial people and persons with HIV infected and not receiving treatment are among the eligible candidates for treatment.
Clinical patients identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsole-like people and those who do not receive antiretroviral therapy for HIV-related partners.
People who live in England and have chosen to live there as a family can also register their participation in a local sexual health clinic.
The programme pays 10 million oil and NHS England under a contract to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP in the collection of clinical evidence on which the medicinal product is intended and how it is used and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new massive action should complement and enable a broad and ever more successful fight against HIV spread.
This is a next three-and-a-a-half-year battle with one of the greatest health problems of mankind."
Deborah Gold, NATO director, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, when properly addressed to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at large HIV risk in England have access to new tools that are individually controlled and independent from negotiations with partners, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this message with warmth."
The director of the Terence Higgins Fund said: "It is now priority to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is rapidly under way and that no HIV risk group members will be excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been conducted, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the PrEP clinical trial has been very welcome and very late after six months of delays and government legging.
Evidence shows how major changes can lead to HIV prevention and life-threatening development.
This clinical trial will lead us to a closer approach to full understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial take over the country as soon as possible to protect people with HIV deficiency and take us to a close-up to the spread of HIV in society."
The electricity price increased in Estonia by 12%, Latvia and Lithuania but decreased.
In July the electricity was reduced by the difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania's price regions by 1,94 euros, compared with 7,71 euros in June, Eling reported.
The main reason for the price differentiation is the injury suffered by the Union industry in Lithuania.
In Estonia, the average price for electricity was EUR 34.33 in the previous month, and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
Latvia and Lithuania decreased the price by five per cent from the amount of EUR 36,27 per hour.
In Finland the price was EUR 34,17 and the price of the Nord Pool system was the same as EUR 26,37 per hour.
Prices rose by 12% and 7%.
Between Estonia and Finland, the electricity moved 75 per cent from the previous month to Estonia, and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining 1 per cent of the hours between the two countries did not take place the following day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, the electricity moved 99 per cent from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours spent in the full transfer capacity.
According to the transactions made on the last trading day of July, Nasdaq OMX on the market in August may be the price of electricity for approximately EUR 34 and EUR 37 per hour.
The price of carbon dioxide for electricity production decreased last month and transactions amounted to EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Higher living - half-order and nutty designers have transformed this small Earls Court card into a room house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a church secretary, changed his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 against the Earls Court.
It is located on Queen Anne Terrace's first stage, and that Joanne has not packed her house, and that the court continues, is an honor to the new designer.
"Before I lived it with the former resident in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equal to my offer price.
I was shown this by the Earls Court, and it had the same high levels.
I fell in love with it and made the same offer the same day."
Since the first visit, it has been a full renewal course of 93 square metres.
At first, it was a bedroom and a narrowly-dwelling apartment to reach a bedroom - a sleeping room. Goanne wanted to add the bedroom and a half-way to use the high beds.
"I wanted high beds, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hillis from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to use 3,8 m high floors and create a house that would not be just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The Law was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-regular order where it could remain.
Erfan was supposed to come to the matter naturally.
"The metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We're trying to reorganize the rooms, so they're going to be on each other, without getting confused.
It wasn't just building a platform, but we used the space construction so that the upper and lower space would be right."
This regulation enabled Erfan to create a room with two fully-fledged rooms in addition to the dramatic elements.
In the afternoon, the eye of the retrouvian eye opens with the age of solid light to the glamorous living room.
The silver-colored gold furniture, silver detail and retro-reflective Serge Mouille's light-pressure room style.
The use of arrowheads plays a role in adding theatre, space and light cycle.
On both sides of the short corridor, the mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, you'll be able to remember the second floor of your mind.
At the entrance, the mirror offers attention to all Joanne's food and clothing requirements.
If not used, it will add to the car’s load the possibility of closing the cages if it is not used by making the image more glamorous.
There's nothing new about the gathering of the crops.
However, there is a unique fact in this book that making is the garage type of door to be reopened.
"There went a little projective," explains Erfan from the MDF-based concept of tertiary activity.
"There's an objection, so it goes very simply when it goes up."
Thanks to the use of the room and bedroom, Joanne now has 16 additional bedrooms, an additional bedroom and a better cardboard plan.
"At the end of the day, the treasure is what you sell - or what gives the treasure value," Erfan says.
"The cinsamaacler is standing in the advanced shape of the tube and makes calculations, supporting the surface of the surface."
Here they have been able to raise the ceiling by using the quality materials that add flexibility to the room.
"Materials are what you're dealing with and which will help you build emotional ties with your home," Erfan says.
"You don't love the power supply on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the language sound."
This shows that a good design and an enlarged area will help to do something amazing from the normal court.
In fact, these songs can cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The main Dane Jensen is an anti-aircraft in Chicago, which fights with my colleague after an official attack.
It shall not be counted other than the earned amount of money which shall not be forgotten by any kind of ethics.
A man sees his wife and three children only in the morning and in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I saw myself thinking that it's already the world's version of "Caradmajor" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler are the same.
As the film goes on, it will be less than a quadratic element, and the morale of filmmakers will continue to appear more and more.
To survive experience, the disease of the main son of an orphan may be reduced.
Now you have to choose between work and family.
The son of an architectural firm who is a dreamy son makes his father think of things that are really important to the big buildings in Chicago, such as faith, kindness, love..., even though it's not going to be a two-wheel disaster.
After the third stage where the son opens his father's eyes, he feels that filmmakers have gone out of the public's reach for sure, because even the most hard of heart viewers can't keep the blind back in the sight of a kind little boy's suffering.
If a son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father will finally be able to understand his work on morality and do good work for an old man who is looking for him.
Now I'm going to think of myself as a disappointment-- if the film is happy, then I prefer my transparency after the film's coffee, but if I'm hungry, then the scenario can at least thank the scenario for a surprise.
For a moment, it's a bit of a doubt that the rest of the coffee is gone - when your husband calls Dane's hospital, and the man's running away in the early hours of the morning to walk back to the corridor.
However, the son has been miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is a positive thing because now it is time to work with the family.
I can also get a good feeling of myself - I can't predict the end of the American drama!
The film is well designed, all the elements needed for it are available.
You can laugh, laugh, showers are good and moral beauty: money is not the most important thing in life.
That movie's coming in pretty good.
The Trumpi new staff member plans to limit the media use of the president.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it, too.
In that case, he'd be the first one.
Politico writes that the new staff member of the White House plans to limit President Trumpini's power of information, including news, in the hope that it will keep the surplus in balance.
Here's a busy reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly met with the senior officials on his first day of work, he brought out the problem of President Donald Trumpi Whites House, which he was planning to resolve in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information should be passed on to him, whether at the paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he shared the good news with him."
Kelly's diagnosis seems completely logical, but others have tried it and have failed to track Trump's media consumption.
President Trumpy's relationship with television is expanding for decades, and even now, when he is in the White House, his televised messages have not been lost anywhere.
"If the candidate Trump was innocent after an accident, it was appropriate to show him that he was accompanied by a fair response in the event that affected him," said former campaigner Sam Nunberg in the Policy of February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the previous campaign worker's words are to take control of the Trumpi Twitter attacks if he ensures that his personal media use also contains a stable and grateful song".
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's use of Twitter has ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's wounds would have been even more intense without their intervention.
We can't seem to know the secrets that Trump didn't post.
If he was able to save himself or some time from evil, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump's continually making the neumatics.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that people in the White House, composed of competing clicks, try to promote their own interests by sending Trumpil to material that supports their world views, but not always reliable.
In the course of the entire season, Politico wrote in May a recommendation to the President for a strategicly-questioned value information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is the following:
"The advantages and advantages of the Trump slows say that Trump can react to negative pressure, especially with harmful effects on the information channels, in a explosive manner, by taking a confirmation to explain their source.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone handed a copy of the Internet procurator Charles C. Johnson's website to GotNews.com, which charged staff agent Katie Walshi that he was a White House "in the source of many information".
There is no difference that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the rape or that he has not provided any specific evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and has taken them back.
Trump read the article and began to come up with a series of questions about Walshi."
Goldmacher added that a temporary staff member of Reince Priebus and White House's director Rob Porter "and tried to set up a system for handling and documenting Trumpin's powerful documents".
How did this happen?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impressive and his assistants are still struggling on behalf of the impact.
These unchanged factors make Kelly a very difficult mission.
The natives from the north of the country are not allowed to acquire permission to present the stone.
In the middle of Tallinn, there are many foreign countries in the music industry.
Those who had the morning talk testified that they were playing in the old age without waiting for the city government.
For the first time, we found about three concerts of Viru, who had brought along the same many dogs.
It was clear that the musicians, with the clothes of the raspases and the firefly, were the silversmiths who would spend one thousand dollars on the march.
Despite the passing of time, the only woman in the orchestra played with the rhyme story, while one man on his side was called in three johnleges and the passengers near him.
The third man was sitting beside them on one side of the porch, and he burned his own glass with fire in his heart.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people of the past.
Bob, who played the orchestra and played with the balls, told Noemi that today’s music is both fun and money.
The purpose of the assembly was to gather the pilot’s home on the same night on board a ship traveling to Finland.
After questioning whether they were allowed to ask the city for an old music, Noemi and Bob answered their questions.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a few days and are usually allowed for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for it," explained Bob.
About 20 minutes later, when we hit the virus again, we saw that two women are next to the musicians and they're going to leave.
The team welcomed the efforts of the Viru center's rascals and dogs to try it.
On Friday, three young men were also present, one of whom had played violins, the other clarinets, and the third was playing with an electronic keyboard.
"We are here to offer people the pleasure of offering to spread music and joy and to serve money for fuel and living," explained the trio piano Mivosh.
In Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be a permit for the city government to be present.
"Of course we don't have it," she laughed.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go to the other side, but we have to try," he added.
Estonia Bank bought EUR 149 million in July under the euro area public banking reserve programme, and the central bank debt portfolio grew to EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the concerns of member states, that the Eurosystem central banks reserve includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds (covered bonds), secured bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The Central Bank shall buy from the market a single debt document to encourage investors who are willing to invest in other currencies.
As a result of purchases, the production of less-risk assets will reduce the risk and will encourage investors to take greater risks.
In general, each central bank purchases its government’s debt register under the public sector’s debt register programme, which is not purchased by other countries.
Since the Estonian State has not issued a debt document, the Estonian Bank shall make the amounts allocated to them within the limits of the amount allocated to them.
The central banks shall also make deposits in those countries where the supply of securities corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
Estonia Bank shall, in general, purchase a debt document from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Estonia Bank shall purchase a debt document within the framework of the reserve programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s debt document was also called, but since June 2016 Eesti Bank has not purchased Eling’s debt.
In the name of the euro area central banks, the Finnish Central Bank will buy both Elering and Estonian Energy debt document from June.
The currents separate the curve and reversing the "Millions Range"
Some of the most powerful citizens of the West Midlands have been hit back into the border with determined rounds of decisions, which have separated the fortress of power from the fortress to win back the remaining ones of their villages.
The halls have been parked in the vicinity of Solihull, which is now near the edge of the 20th century.
They're back with horses, children and vehicles after they're out of there alone, and don't let themselves be distracted by the cracks that stole the power to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the protective borders, putting their vehicles through the rest of the remaining parts left for foot.
The poor people have spoken of the Solihull Court of Justice, saying that it is "used to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They were there the first night after their excavation from Bentley Heath, where they ran through the rocks.
The desire must be destroyed in order to get them to act because they are used to dealing with the problem.
The raids were there in May, they were going to leave, and now they're back.
They came last night, probably even more today."
He added: "Birmingham's will knows how to deal with such things by purchasing long-term obstacles to protecting their parks.
I live by Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy that I have to continue to pay for my powers if the power can't even prevent such a thing."
One local resident who also wanted to stay anonymous said: "It's ridiculous. We've only seen how the last of these runners left, and there's already been a new escape.
This time the number has grown and the number has even been shown in the herd's memory."
The representative of the Solihull Court said: "We are aware that the Streetsbrook road near the country is not permitted, and we cooperate with the Solihull police. We implement the necessary legal measures to enable them to move as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence is a very large aid if as many local residents as possible are aware of any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police, calling for number 101.
This will help create a picture for the case if we present the case to them."
The Weekend Festival also visits all others, Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased to have been able to bring true tips to Estonia.
The question of why it is so important for the Estonians at the Weekend Festival is that Saar should ask everyone who enjoys the festival for three days.
Kurll, however, believes that the real actors in his area have come to Pärnus.
"In view of the level of artists who have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute names of this musician - this is often not happening in our country," says the Minister of Culture.
What are the artists at the festival, but what is Saart talking about?
I think to be relatively analytics and for my kind, I'm sure one of the most experienced art artist Armin van Buuren who was sitting up last night.
According to his record, all of us have been on our own for some time," he says.
However, he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our Estonian authors are also: starting from NOÉP and they can be read throughout the range.
In fact, the concentration of known names is very high," he says.
Look at the shortest video of the morning!
The audit updates car manufacturers in the middle of the crisis up to 850 000 diesel vehicles
The day before the audit report, BMW said it was offering software to more than 350 000 vehicles.
In the first letter of BMW, the company believes that "there are more detailed options than vehicle restrictions", referring to European cities, including the national BMW to Munich, which has been considered to be prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will update three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engines.
No company has described these activities as a refusal.
European car manufacturers have announced the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the rules on CO2 emissions.
However, gas oxide separated from diesel engines is considered to be cancerous and may cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of the equipment installed to neutralise the air-conditioned exhaust gases of diesel vehicles is increased to make it difficult to maintain the price of vehicles competitively.
At the same time as Germany's car manufacturers are under a thorough investigation, the Government of the Union of Angela Merkel shall also be charged with the withdrawal of power from the car manufacturers and the withdrawal of the signs referring to the problem.
Businesses are trying to avoid the recurrence of Volkswagen's errors, which, despite so many delays in the use of waste equipment that could be adapted to the regulations in the time of the vehicle test during the test of exhaust gases, have fallen back to normal driving conditions.
Several of the leaders of Volkswagen have been brought before the United States of America and others are both under investigation at the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of the unit's thermodynamics department of the Audi motor development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore is not protected from being released and can go to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi Germany committed a criminal investigation in the absence of Volkswagen, where the authorities accused the installation of the Audit System of removing the requirements for European emissions by extending the approach that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the audience in the study may be a large hope for Volkswagen, the manufacturer of closed vehicles generates an unproportionally large proportion of the benefit of Volkswagen.

The murder of a journalist highlights a growing danger in Mexico
The working day of the week in Riodace usually gathers three days to look at plans for the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt officials and drug abuses in Sinaloa.
But today they have gathered to discuss their own security with personal tragedy.
They're told it's important to change their routine.
Two grandparents discuss what seems to be a danger: to bring the children to the office with them, which was the target of the Grand Duchy in 2009, or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words to the loved one in front of the room: "the enemy", "the neutrals", "the allies".
They ask the reporter to provide no evidence at all, enough memory and inner sense.
In the interest of government or cartels, the full list of domestic salesmen, politicians, businessmen and journalists is questioned, which poses a threat to the recovery of the capital of Mexico’s government.
There are no price cuts, and most of these deaths are rising over the country, most of which are reported by journalists in the Committee of the Prosecutors of the Protection of the Committee since they were founded by President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 at least 25.589 journalists have been subjected to attacks and threats under national protection and have been killed in at least seven countries during this year.
Among the last sentences are the editor and inspiration source, Riodoce, co-author Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives deep impression, although his location can be seen across the Riodoce building fassad, a large picture of the central border of Valdez with the book "Justice" and two 30-day reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, support the T-shirt, which has been painted with his funny face or a self-sustaining face.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. The reporters will discuss common traumas, their mood swings, sleep, paranoia.
Although a separate State prosecutor was established in 2010, only two cases were brought before the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice.
As in the case of deaths related to trafficking and organised crime, the number of deaths in thousands of cases, the deaths of journalists, as well.
As a result of Riodoce, violence in Sinaloa continues to be eliminated, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is still dangerous.
Without criminal data and justice, Ibarra’s meeting on security is of no great benefit.
"It's really nice to spend your time here at the meeting," she says.
"Until the reason is known, you're all in trouble."
Valdez left the country’s capital, Culiacan, at the Riodoc office on May 15th.
He managed to drive just a couple of quartets before two men stopped his red Toyota Corrolla. He drove out of the car and shot him 12 times.
The armed man drove Valdez into the car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left his wife and two grown children.
The public in Culiacan is free of charge.
But Valdez's theme is basically just a simple one.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the release to the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest warheads in the country, as the rivals fight for the fulfilment of power requirements.
There is no difference that Sinaloa’s people are left each day with a few people or a lot of people or that the dead are taken away from the so-called two-time drug addicts, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let us remember for a moment that the meal refers to when a valuable port and the coastal part of the United States of America are only one map.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was extremely aware of the dangers associated with his work, Riodocé's co-chair and director Ismail Bojorquez (60) is aware of the surprising sympathies he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that you made two mistakes in killing.
The first of these were the release of an interview with the children of Guzman and the cartel in the war called Damasso Lopezi in February.
This article may well be angered by suspicious members who bought all copies of the issue as soon as they arrived in the journals.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave his country for his own safety after the incident in one of the same history events.
Valdez was a legend in both Mexico and abroad, and his execution is seen as a violence directed against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues thought he was always there.
In 2003, he worked as a veterinary reporter at the Noroes newspaper when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with without a drug problem."
The newspaper was full of time for a sense of security and honesty, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters were pleased to publish their efforts without censorship and to let readers read stories that no one else had ever heard.
Eight years after Riodoce was established, the newspaper won its prestigious Maria Moors Caboti prize for Latin America's contests.
In the same year, the Valdez Journalists won the award of international press freedom for their freedom to follow up on Mexico’s drug abuse to everyone where it leads.
He openly confessed that he was a coward.
"I want to go on living," he said, taking the AKK loan.
Earlier in October, he told the TV technician Rompevento TV that the retail trade is in Sinaloa's life.
"You must take a job that comes with a journalist's office with another chance is to play crazy.
I don't want you to ask me what I did in front of so many dead people or why I didn't tell you what's going on."
Riodoce collectives belong to Valdez, a musician who played as a star, a friend who shared embodies and advice, a teacher who knew how to live.
They supported his routine.
He's always driving his car.
He left the office on his way to the El Guayabo bar and sat on the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine has made him attractive.
His death has also caused them to doubt how to do their job best and stay alive.
"They don't like you leaving their wives, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landfills used for the transport of drugs."
"They weren't meant to touch things," said Bojorquez.
As a result, even in the best of times, there are strong self-sensitivity and self-restraints.
Trust your instincts.
If the matter falls suspicious, keep it away.
Riodoce's actor Andres Villallarreal says the problem is that "the blaster can't... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that Sinaloa no longer applies the old rules, just as they were not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other countries, which are home to the migrating of fraud, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce's employees met for security training, mobile phones were no longer allowed; some days before this it was revealed that only the funds sold to governments were used to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for a relief from 40-kraine heat.
The government has appointed them to oversee the Riodoc office, which is located in a four - story district in the center of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who had been accused of being dishonest.
A number of months have passed since the reporters have traveled to the major places where the control of de facto drugs is in the hands of the drug dealers.
Riodoce discussed three main points this week.
One of them was a former boxer, Julius Caesar Chavez, brother of Sinaloas.
In addition, they had a clear history of the government’s spending money to the Governor’s household.
And the prosecutor's office was one of the most expensive people in Culiacan's restaurant.
There was no formal information about who was robbed or how this happened, so it became prudent when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew about the restaurant was a memory place of both the wholesalers and the authorities.
The reporter was informed from public documents that the restaurant was registered for a policy that belongs to the existing institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all policy reports almost throughout the previous century.
In recent times, a number of IRP cybercrime has been accused of widespread corruption in the context of cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write from the previous entrants at the same place, including how our son, El Chapo, escaped from the military.
A few months earlier, readers would have searched for Valdez column to get information about the human race in the best possible way.
"We'd already know what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose bodybuilding has served him as El Flaco.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been set up for the blind and the lame who protest against the killing of journalists, and the workers have received something they have never been able to wait for the activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez called a couple of times and directed the next morning to the office of the local prosecutor after a subsequent journalist.
Salvador Adame died three days after Valdez was killed in the western part of Michoacan.
It has been found in the dead body, and the official says it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more and more vocal throughout the country, and are critical of organized protests on the streets and buildings of the phrase "SOS press".
On that day, President Bojorquez is removed from Washington, attempting to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after the death of Valdez, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the officials of sedition and murder.
After that, he asked him to turn his attention to the government’s activities to others, worrying that his anger had affected his objectiveness.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists have organized crime, co-accused government officials and any society "restricted".
He wrote in his last book "The Black Paper" that the reporters not only kill the drug dealers, but also do so by order of politicians and security forces, which are organised in the field of crime.
In the previous year, the Media Channel Monitoring Group owned more than half of the attacks by journalists on the police and public officials.
"You're going to die in Mexico, because you're going to be put to death," said Ramirez.
They're clearly affecting the blood vessels.
No one remembers the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia's death six years ago in the northern coastal state of Tamaulipas.
He found a dead body with a letter that he probably wrote under the cartel Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reporters."
In addition to his mammoth head, the computer keyboards and keyboards were released.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, the newspaper El Norte in the northern border country of Chihuahuas after the death of their correspondent Miroslava Breachi in March.
Others continue as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after their leader's death in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez called on the drug cartels in public with a guide entitled "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have paid off from their home countries or even from their country.
The fact is with a recent decision.
Exyl is hard to find, and they still need to consider the dangers.
And sometimes they're behind them, as it was supposed to be with Ruben Espino, who was killed with four women in 2015 in a Mexican court three months after the Veracruz page.
Those who remain in place and continue to work have to rethink their risk-related decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to be a thinker, admits that drug abuse frightens him.
"Mehiko is on the way to hell and that's why I'll report it," he said.
In the middle of a recent race, where the coolest number was already broken, the Riodoce operators sat in front of the office in front of the train and cut off the oil as soon as they started to vibrate all the phones.
In the coastal shortline of Mazatlan, there were 19 persons convicted of alleged fraud and security forces in future exchanges.
The war continues, as promised by several of the remaining messages of the cartels found in the region.
At the same time run on the page reporters using the new mobile phone, using Riodoce's website.
The next day, we need to change.
The Siriens looked forward to the next transition in the region.
Bojorquez kept watch on the police, to see if they're watching.
If they were scared, they didn't show it at least.
Historically, the founder's massive portrait, where his central bridge is to see the entire Sinaloa, was followed by the workers of Riodoce.
"How could you think of the whole closure," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed, asked the practitioners to make him a reporter?"
Dinosaurus used a protective colour to avoid enemies
First of all, it looks like a picture, even though it's kind of scary.
The researchers have now published the first findings in relation to the untrustworthy presence of the canal of the canal, which has been so well preserved that the scholars have described it as "Mona Lisat of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with her hair was the color of the red-scarlet and her past was somewhat "skin".
The newspaper Current Biology published a report describing the existence of "the best preserved substance in the world that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
In the case of fossil fuels, it is a new type of nodosasurance, which lives in the middle of the crisis, 110-112 million years ago.
Incredibly, keeping a good reputation in the operas, which describe it as "very significant".
The farmer covered with these compounds has kept the best national Geographic data on this type of fossil that has ever been found.
This was found on 21 March 2011 in Shawn Funk, when he complained about Suncor Millenium in Fort McMurray's hunger strike near North Alberta Canada.
He found something that didn't mention the surrounding stone, and he decided to investigate more closely.
The open fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell palontology Museum.
For the next six years, it was established that the animal should be harvested from 2500-year-olds (1100-kilograms).
After all this mess, the final result is now ready to produce the public.
"When a little eye drops, you can almost believe that he's asleep," said author Caleb Brown, a teacher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the presence is exposed.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the dinosaur Mona Lisa."
In his extensive research, he found that this farmer, who is well - fed with spices and remembers walking tanks, likely threatened significantly meat - rich dinosaurs.
With strong strains, the dinosaurs used red and white protective colors to protect themselves against insects, and developed a protective technique called resistance and used by many animals today.
This allowed the speaker’s words to make the dinosaurs feel better in the environment and to avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs probably held him for years.
It was a 110 million-year-old homeless family that was the first time ever to reach the new fish and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell paleontology Museum.
The facts have now been examined and referred to it by Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Boreaopelt Mark Mitchell Museum, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7000 hours on the wild to reveal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of itself, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the species in the body.
They discovered a method of protection that was developed in the country of responsibility, which means that the removal of the existence was worse than subduing.
Although resistance has been widespread, the findings will be surprising, since Boraelopel has a mark greater than that of animals living with the resistance today.
This regrets that the dinosaurs have actively pursued other food-producing dinosaurs, preferring evolution as an anti-living strategy.
But most of the animals used today’s resistance - such as monsters, snakes, or armaments - are getting a lot smaller and more harmful, which suggests that the nodosus had to be really hard to survive.
"The powerful pursuit of dinosaurs covered with great and strong passions shows how dangerous it would be to be more likely to be a threat to the criminary dinosaurs," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds of the soybeans revealed in the same way that the skin of the dinosaur was red.
Scientists continue to investigate animals to find clues about this life, including the content of the shell that has been stored to explain what the animal is by its final breath.
They believe that the dinosaur died in a cave in the middle of the river, reaching a lake where he was clearly in front of the ocean.
At that time Albert had the same room as today in South Florida, and the seas and oceans would probably extend much farther into the interior than at present.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant, since it has been completely covered with somnolence skin, yet it has also remained a three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal appears today almost the same as the cricket.
It doesn't have to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it - just spits out the eyes and seems to be right to sleep."
The crisis was the time when the Earth was being hit by the bloated two legs of meat eaters moving dinosaurs - theropods.
Although all of these kings of Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after Boraelopole, some of his scary predecessors might have been able to cast it off the recommended dinosaurry.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 m) long and six tonne-weighted colleges.
Scientists who have published recent findings in the newspaper Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was killed after his death and that the mummification of this disease was altered.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk opened his complaint at the Millionium in the asylum of Fort McMurray near North Alberta Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best that has kept a taste in the world, including skin and tastes, and it is a complete combination until the end of the year.
These existences were averaged 18 feet (five meters) long and weighing up to 3,000 needles (1300 kg).
Two 20 ton of gold came out of that debt.
Scientists believe that it was a plant that was covered with spices through the current West Canada, until it was too late for that summer.
However, the marine dimension of the dinosaur has helped to preserve its tastes in detail.
The remains of this particular property have been so well preserved that the remains of the long dinosing of the toys of the game are still covering the hair.
As Michael Greshko wrote in his National Geographic journal: "Selline's conservation status is as rare as that of a whale.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stirred hairstyles continue to cover the game’s three-footed petals.
The best way to get rid of him is to get away from him, and five of the guards are headed over.
I've got a chance to read his dreams."
How did one of the activists find the answer to the question "Who are thanks?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
The last day after New York's trip, this man sat on the street by St. Louisian Airbnb, passing on Facebook.
He was hit by his never-ending mail.
There was a letter saying, "The police killed a 18-year-old boy, and he's still free today."
She was confused why no one else had posted this information on her voice, so she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidega @TheePharoh user's postings were repeatedly distributed in his age.
From the region of St. Louis, a lion was sent by Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who killed a white policeman in Ferguson in Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's life from the body that was released tonight, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," thought Ferrell himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later that night he saw a rehearsal that announced this time that people's gathering in Canfield Drive.
He took photos of the police and the angry people, and of the man who claimed to be Brown's father, and still kept the book "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son!".
He was looking at a real village where a cop was standing in front of a group of protestors.
In the second video, one of the other cops ran away and said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrrell remembers how he used to think, "It's impossible."
"It's not the kind of murder we've used and what we could call typical."
I felt terrible at the time.
I was angry and drunk."
He got back and drove home the next day.
On his 23th birthday, he went to his six - year - old daughter and decided that they would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrelli and Ferguson the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Who do you think?"), which is featured in the film on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and loss, of the strength and commitment of those who live in this community and who meet the requirements.
When Ferrrell and his daughter - who had a beautiful dress and the head of a suitable crown - on the side of Ferguson, they discussed again the subject that had happened to them before this morning several times before -- the experiences and living conditions of the black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" she recalls herself.
"We're driving now, Ferguson, because the police killed 18-year-old boy and that's not true."
"I couldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's going on right now is... in the past at the culmination of the event.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in it.
He must learn about activism and organization and also learn about the different aspects of the Black Sea experience and living conditions and what we must do to get freedom and freedom from ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not personally experience racism, he does not differ from some other black girl.
I know I'd make him angry if I'd protect him from this world."
The first stop they did when they arrived in Ferguson was on the way to South Florence - from the police station on the way to the rest of the road, from which they had received a certain cargo cargo plate, where the activists were waiting for new police officer Darren Wilson, who had not finally filed a complaint.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who made lunches.
They gathered together the food tables and helped them share these protests.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activity began to take shape slowly.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student in Missouri-St. Louis at the university, he was the President of the Middle Ages and focused on food law and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It's just a lot."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with a film associate, Sebaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to just document what was happening.
Ferrell's sister asked: "Are you trying to document or find a story that can be used?"
A positive scepticism has resulted in a number of cases where people - often white people - come to society and try to cut off their pain and resistance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson is not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already broken his hands with Miss Damon Davis, a regional artist who was known for his activity in connection with the death penalty.
His involvement changed the project for Ferrelli and six other locals, who filmed the "Whose Streets" team after Brown's shooting years later.
"There's no one talking about us or us in this documentary, but we're talking about ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important for me to imagine how these people were, because they were the same to me."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - perhaps to show that movement does not stand "by the leader but by the community meeting", as Folayan said, made his film the most open part.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is extremely personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as love and marriage to his wife.
"I felt like I'd be down," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he was getting ready for the town store.
"While I understand that this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by some vulnerability."
More and more, Ferrelli's story emphasizes and re-emerges the role of a middle-class black homosexual woman in the wider Black Live Matter movement.
Two of the three starters who were thinking about social media in 2012 after the death of the BlackLivesMutter, the BlackLivesMutter, were homosexual.
"In the ruling role of the Black Sea homosexual women have kept the movement above the ground," said Ferrrell, "and that's just because we have to keep fighting on several lines.
Blackish homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement actually keeps black women alive and many of them are black people who are homosexual women".
He also claims that "the creation is not a matter of the type of creation of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli has not chosen the film at the center because of his identity.
"He was a man with the right energy," he said.
"Although it is not a coincidence that he was directly in the neighborhood, because in such places as the Nordic homosexual woman, there are many dangers in living.
His energy is possible through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras have disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between society and the police are still weak.
During the time of Ferrelli's entertainment, the sentence continues for 2.5 years.
He describes a social political atmosphere in the region he calls home, just "freedom".
On the other hand, he still has to be an important mantra that he has eaten since he went to the people of Ferguson three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Our obligation is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We don't have to lose anything on our knees."
7 nipps how to get the basic after Weekend
Some older men find that after the sunset, they have to get help from what's going on, too.
Or they're going to say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But it's just an inevitable continuation and a healthy routine.
What can you do to get the best feeling and the most reasonable possible way to get over this weekend's trawl or others tomorrow?
Joo water.
Under and after a big drink in the morning... or maybe even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses alcohol when it needs a lot of water, it must be recovered somehow.
Along with water, minerals are also released from the body and the station is a good drink of mineral oils.
Since the taste has often deteriorated, it is especially good if the product is free of paint or simply easily heated.
Go walk.
Certainly, it would not be reasonable to force the trees to jump to the old tree, which may prove to be a deceptive lie.
But a simple walktime helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
In the long run, washing and drying are the most urgent way to heal.
Give your body the energy back to your level and carefully.
If you're running from a previous crossing to such a part, surely you don't want to try to load a lot of heavy tires.
For example, start fresh milk, which contains the fruit juices of your body, instead of being marketed.
If the sun is already healthy, you could try the lungs, for example.
And it's been a while since.
Take some coffee.
This diet frees your body from the last water.
As already said, water and milk are your friends.
Don't be a painkiller.
If you take the painkiller at night to prevent the headache, you must make your pay in addition to alcohol with paracetamol or ibuprofen and lose your power.
So bad their tax is even more, and they're worse off.
In addition, it didn't last very long.
If you take the painkiller in the morning, don't do it completely empty - it'll upset your so-called stomach.
Or if you don't take the partner, you can get through with yourself.
It smells like walking, but walking doesn't get an orgasm.
But instead of being too active and turning aside, physical exertion should be moderate in the background.
You're kidding.
Take time with your friends and colleagues for fun, make simple jokes, and laugh friendlyly, both yourself and others.
The jokes and the jokes can't give you the bonfires, but they must have made the follow-up more fun.
Once it's over, it's over!
The professor of Northwestern and Oxford University employees are looking for a suspicious murder
According to the police, the university professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University staff are searching for suspects following the discovery of a death certificate from one of Chicago’s high-end deaths.
According to the country's case documents, the first day was issued without a warrant for arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren for arresting them for their alleged murder with Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Document data killed 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau after repeated blanking.
According to the care provided by the Chicago Police Department to the community, death penalty was found on 27 July.
The police got a phone call and found Grand Plaza's apartment on the arrival of a victim who had a lot of stolen property.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was identified as the death scene and the investigators were involved in the murder, while the police were actively seeking two suspects.
Since 2007, Lathem has been working as co- professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest.
The vice-president of public relations at the university, Alan K. Cubbage, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been temporarily dismissed and has been banned from entering the cities of Northwestern University.
"It is now with a criminal investigation of the competent authorities and the Northwestern University is working with the researchers," Cubbage said.
Warren is an assistant to the Oxford University financial department.
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been in the Community with the British police and have been prepared to assist the US investigation authorities in any way possible."
In addition, it was written in a letter that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Anthony Guglielm, Director of the Police Department of Chicago Communications, recommends that he give himself up to the powers of suspects.
"The police have a goal where they come from, but we are doing more intensively with the definition of the exact place," said Guglielmi.
Guglielm’s words help to find local, regional, and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza card manager, who had just received a cryptic tip, that the card number 1008 had done something.
According to police reports, it was possible to take a look.
It is not clear whether the incident itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence at the hospital.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza board sent a letter to the residents: "Police is currently working on explaining the history of the events and the fate of the victim and examining various motives, including the possibility that this was a family model."
The companies that help your companies avoid getting Uberiks next
Amy Erret wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in their e-commerce original firm, but the issues were raised.
The answers were often indefinite, used or even worse.
And even if he agreed to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Erret, who runs 75 workers in San Francisco, sold e-commerce by Madison Reed.
So he invited outsiders to help.
In particular, there are new types of human resources companies that help businesses to explain what their employees are aware of.
In developing and licensing software, which aims to measure the involvement of workers, they enable businesses to deal with exacerbating issues, to identify certain team and demographic groups, to provide workers with anonymity and hot line of complaints and, in some cases, to allow translators to pass through the C-Tases and turn directly to the board.
"Now there are such tools as Strava and Fitbit, which are intended to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-author and CEO of Redwood City, former company Glint, whose software analytical tools are used to measure the integration of workers.
In other words, he's been given three years where he's been using Glint, a lot better than what his employees think and feel.
In addition to the immediate and specific issues addressed to the departments, this company's warm card provides an overview of which areas are most likely to complain and which are the lowest aid available, allowing it to explain the reasons.
The companies have come to understand that they must remain in the course of their working culture, not to change to the next Uberik, which has been measured in the scandals since the previous employer published a blog post that described the disturbing environment where those who promised to take the word were punished.
For foreign companies such as Glint, the advantage of having an overview is the result of a business opportunity.
The global management, regulatory and compliance area may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
In Denver, Colorado, a former company that helps businesses prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, Uber's suspicious reputation in this year has seen an increase in interest and activity.
The conference has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glintki, Konvertent allows companies to send adapted push questions, to collect real confidential responses and to look at the problem areas of heat maps.
This provides anonymized message indicator, which allows workers to be informed of the discrepancies.
And when it comes to conduct, the complaints will go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been analysed by the regulatory authorities," said Convercenti's founder and director Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if it is considered that the company treats its employees badly or acts in an unfair manner, the company may have serious consequences, such as consumer fraud, the absence of workers and the judiciary, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant with more than 25,000 employees in 500 jobs, has spent more than a year in order to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and activities and to provide a convenient way to deal with the corporate headquarters.
If the employer wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporation’s head office, submit an official complaint and expect it to be taken seriously.
It was often a rather disturbing and infamous process, said general general James Vitrano, who said that there were no good ways to monitor employees' complaints.
Now, where the company uses Convent, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment or misappropriation, which have not been reached by former leaders who have acted in other cities or countries.
"I have a chance to get closer to the strong 360-kraad experience of workers," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our components from the criticisms of employees."
Quinlan said that companies had started ethical behaviour, values and the involvement of employees much more serious than in 2002 or after the hearing firm Arthur Andersen was accused of ethical violations in connection with Enron's scandal.
But only when the social media became a cookie did the companies realize that they can't prevent their black pesos from publicly playing the web.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used the strategy as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Converter offer their software service by taking a temporary fee from the company for the use of their products.
This is in businesses and the possibility of which risk capital investors' approval has been granted to both of them.
In February, ten million dollars were financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised 47 million dollars in total capital.
On November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bestemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s gross cost of $60 million.
Such investments shall not be surprising if they take into account the relationship between enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today’s workers expect more work than ever before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, there are high wages and projects interested only in the contribution that is on the table.
Workers want to know that they are accepted and valued and that they dedicate their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in business, they feel that they are heard and that the work they are doing is a source of satisfaction, they are more dedicated to the advancement of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is the Vice-President of the Section for general benefit and the experience of workers in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercenti and Glinti.
Investors earn income when businesses in their portfolio go well; businesses go well when workers are dedicated and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow to increase the commitment and involvement of workers, there is no wonder that they are available.
Personal data on the involvement of workers is important in the words of employers.
However, these data have been used if the company’s monitors do not have anything to do with them.
In fact, if a company asks its employees for feedback, it may be expected that changes will occur.
And if changes do not take place fast enough or not at all, it may lead to fraud and reduce the involvement of workers.
"If you asked for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for the 4000 negotiations," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make mistakes by supporting too much data collection.
"Because if things don't end up, the workers think, "Did you actually hear me?
Are you taking care of it?
And if you don't care, then why should I care?"
In other words, Madison Reed, who is currently conducting six studies at the workplace, has been able to implement the measures on the same day as Glint has been informed of the problem.
And since the speed of decisions and the quality of the treatment of workers, it was possible for him to reorganise and offer communication training in order to deal with the problems.
However, new data on workers are collected on Ruby Tuesday, and it is hoped that in a long-term perspective it will bring with it a long-term industry industry dedicated to workers, which is known for their large labour volume.
"If you have not dedicated yourself to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The euro area's serious point is Baltic: revenue increases rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic Sea, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the entry of rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg writes a reference to the report of the European Central Bank.
Since 1999, the Central Bank's overall economic output for people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
On the other hand, there is low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and a business and free market-friendly policy.
"The Baltic States, with one Slovakia, are in small euro area countries where real-SKP people have significantly closer to the EU centre," the central bank said.
Although the objective is to make the overall economy more stable for people in Western Europe, in 2015, the total production of the Baltic economy was made up of 2/3 15 countries, which became part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
The low wages have brought the ballasts to find a better wage abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing today, the local population is not quite enthusiastic.
According to the most recent Eurobarometer survey, only the average population of Latvia and Lithuania was estimated to go very well or longer in their economies.
Chechnya and Poland considered this to be a little less than half of their economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel two-day trains will change the days of Brunei.
It is almost 23, when the trobi community stops to talk about the UCLA legs in a new exercise room located in the university of the team.
Some of them have fallen from the edge of the lake, revealing their training gear from the first day's effort to the higs.
For most of the team, these minutes of power from the middle of the day are spent.
Players who participate in the popular courses will be able to learn after three hours of training in the final exam before returning to the next meeting at 6.30 a.m. in the walkway of Wasserman.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said trainer Jim Mora a little before the second day.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the trains that take place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has actually changed their days longer - at least until the end of the season.
For this reason, UCLA was the first three of the first trainings started at 19.15 in order to fit players in such a short time period.
The passing of two training days means more than one training days - the beginning of the training course in Brunsis was raised in comparison with the previous summer almost a week before and the first time the training took place during the six Westwood season.
They will have 18 trains by 20 August, before the formal preparation begins to take place in September to open up Texas A&M.
Mora says it is by the regulatory change of the NCAA, although it adds another agenda item to the players' heavy schedules.
"They have three or four days of tired weight and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they are troubled about this trial; they are troubled; they are young men, they are mighty.
I believe that when the Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really a little bit."
When the lake has finished, UCLA will become a training facility, which is not a simple task, taking into account clear views of these challenges from the parking platform and from the centre of Luskin, the higher class of the hotel, which has already been able to pass through the protective network around the city.
From this weekend, hotel players in Bruns, but Mora acknowledged that problems can arise from rooms with free rooms.
"Let's build security," said Mora.
"It's a real place of concern and it's not too much to think that people can rent a room and film the training out there.
If you have saved your training, you can do a really good deal with it.
But we're using the 8th parking lot.
Let's give ourselves the best we can.
I'm not going to worry about that.
We have a plan in place."
As a result, the Savisare-Ivanova election was brought to the Central Region, Christina Ojulland and EKRE, who were expelled from the Reforma region, created by Maria Kaljušte in joining the forces of Our Tallinn and the parties to show the expected business election of Tegus Tallinn - it appears that the elections created in the initiative of the parties involved at least as much as the individual in the local elections today.
However, Tibuses are read deep, and the question arises whether they are sharing enough corrupted voters.
Who's staying with Savisare?
If Edgar Savisare's support team has been reduced to a low level, it may be possible to focus on the events organised by his electoral union.
One member of the National Assembly, some progress and current medium-sized and many unknown faces - can this be possible with the Union of Elections?
And is there any reason why some of Savisaire's supporters and friends avoid the application in Tallinn may seek to find out that the "Saviare List" of Europeans, in which there are corrupts and corruption barriers, is it possible to be effective?
In the view of the municipal government, the foreign populace, which is part of the city of Lasnamáe; and in every sense, the original calculation, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to decide to avoid the noises and noises that hit the road - is this the first time that the Central Court tries to vote the 16- and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to attend the elections?
Let's just wait for what's going on in other categories from a young election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 is viewed by a viewer from August to August in the face of a black hole, there will be two choices: agree to continue to see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels or to create 10 channels per month to some teleoperator.
It is also true that those who at first enjoy free telecommunications publicly, but in the end, it is likely that they will pay for television and advertising.
The most impressive feature of the festival is music, folk music, music, music, music, music, and music.
If you don't want to have a party of your own, but instead of selling, you're gonna have to find out where you're going and where you're staying for a lot of fun to leave for the festival students.
Washington will change the rules of the red card
The media are setting up President Donald Trumpi, who is saying that there is a new US immigration plan, which changes the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for the acquisition of temporary employment and restrictions on family orientation.
The new rules have been proposed by the Liberals and the President supports them.
The legislative proposal will be discussed at the two-home conference.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of money for taxpayers, as it changes how the US produces green cards for citizens of other countries.
The law reduces the deficit and starts replacing the current programme.
The new application process gives priority to candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump in the US media report.
The Siberian youths move around the city, retirees back to the country.
Jevsejev Anatoli continues the tradition of the ancient Maana Seas of the Great Seas.
He works at home about 150 miles [140 km] across the Mana Lissi River in Kuvai as a golden car guide.
It's hard work: two months from now without rest days for 12 hours and then only ten days at home and again.
During the three years worked in the art, Anatoli has only once seen gold.
"There's a lot of times: in the past, it's checked thoroughly that wine doesn't come along, and out of the memory that gold doesn't take along," says Anatoli.
In a conversation with Mare Piho in Haiti, the local station with Jaan, who has talked to him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The historical culture still maintained in Siberia is also affected by home settings, as it is simply so liberal, thinks of the far-reaching sets studied by Piho Mare.
His first investigation trip to Siberia lasts 30 years.
During that time, he went there 14 times and lived there together for a year.
How many sets were still running out in Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I figured it out about seven Siberian men who have thought about it.
It's hard to say, because one group could come from up to 30 people at that point, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was given to only one, but she had children, sisters, and children.
Look how big this territory was here!
It's been more than a few times since the history of Setoma.
It was necessary to learn, to manage in any way.
Settos came here as farmers, but their lives changed because they were in areas not only related to agriculture, but also with water (petroleum), transport, industry.
For example, in New Petser, many sets went to work later in the city of Krasnojarsk-45 (which built the Council's power to build a railway station - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the plants form most of the population in the region?
Yeah, they lived in compatrice.
In addition, long - standing tradition of marriage and polygamy remained.
Seventy-eight children in the family were normal.
How many Siberian sets are different and different from those of their mother?
They're different, even though what was produced here was ever the same.
They brought a lot of people together.
So they did (peoples) themselves, but they always changed what was produced and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the situation, as it is even colder here.
Food changed.
For example, the meat was salted, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the sites of the Siberian constitution and what life is there? / Graphic: Allari Paluots
The bond with the mother was strong spiritually, and it was very important.
I think now it's starting to give Setuma back there, it's going to affect them.
These girls who have lived around here have heard amazing stories.
The bad must be seen by the people of the Estonian delegation who came to Haiti in early July on the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived at home for four days - J. P.
What's all there is is, it's disgusting.
"The roof is a great place to come and get away, because the city has a great place: in the railway station and in the parking lot," says the operaist Reigo Tamm.
The city is no longer just a military base, we have a lot of nature, a sports and a cultural place, and it's going to be all over the corner.
Kill is a tip-top city!
There is a small island across the White Sea, where visitors are accustomed to keeping the janitory.
"It's not lookin' like a good time," Reigo says.
Anyone who does not fear cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of alkaline.
I've been there in the new world, it's gonna be perfect!
The river can keep a picnic and just make romantics - it can blow the water into the eye and think about life ahead and want.
I've gone there with my wives, too.
The operaist Tamm, after all, has gone through three o'clock between them: "Because this place is along the city, no one can stand against it if they tell their stories."
"The human being opens a wonderful view of the Tapela, but there are also healthy people who can walk around, and now, for example, play discgolf - golfers have been made, who can borrow from the sports center," Reigo says.
The old profiles are going there with their kids, but I haven't been there yet to play.
It is likely that Mrs Rasmus Cull Tapela should be invited to attend because she has experienced a discgolfimension and she has a lot of passions.
That's what he owes me!
Reigo and Mannikumämä were currently incapacitated.
At least for hours.
There's been a lot of bullshit, corruption, and you've got my sports life.
No mention of broken bones and bones.
"The entire centre is now full of buildings, all of which is becoming unknown," Reigo says.
Killing an old and tired vaccine is a very attractive place to play fun.
I am glad that in 2012 the leader of the R.A.A.A.A.M. Mart Meos took my idea and came to do the V.A. with his theatre.
Although today's theatre time "Aleksei Karenini" has just passed, on August 11th, there is a railing "Education" when an old vassal is moving around in the 1980s.
"11.-13. August is the days of the town of Tapa, where the houses of the vassals have been opened and there are rare cultural events, including public events," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city on that very day from 91.
On the short side of the house on May 1, 1994, the museum has already been in place.
"The house is small, but the exhibition is very good and informative," says Reigo, which is full of the history of the town of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railways and the war.
Reigo remembers that when Tapal passes all the desired places, the sand goes to a long distance away, but luck is a little bit filled.
"We have so good restaurants and meetings sometimes feel you're out," he says.
The trained soldiers and the young soldiers who came to Tabala spend a lot of time in the pubs, the station is sitting there feeling that you are in Estonia and your home, but the transformation is such an international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories about French or American people.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal interrogation
On TV, BTV cited a foreign minister who informed the two Bulgarians that they had been arrested for illegal telephony in Greece.
On 1 August, the police arrested a group of illegal police in the city of Sidon, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but now the investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on freedom of movement and are already imposing a cruel scourge on all those who remain in a place of rest which is not provided for.
The controls will continue throughout the clock.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the penalty may be fixed.
Dogs teaching dogs go to the labs in trouble.
After a year, the Chinese lodgers had to give the hunt back to the hunters to give their class the "learning material" - apparently the dogs who had been taught by dogs have already been bitten by the lions.
Today, dogs in the Hiiu region have been bitten three times, totaling 23 sheep and injured twenty-two, writes Hiiu Leht.
I had only three, 124 years ago.
There is also information from the environmental agency that the Hyiamaal has not been born and that the Hyiama Jaginas Council is informed that there are two dogs on the island this year.
On the first day of the night, dogs in the village of Emmas visited Kabuna from 15 sheep and injured 18 others from the lamb.
On the third day in the morning, the dogs came up to Rehesel, and struck down one lamb, and killed the one that was to be killed.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified agricultural crops must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a proposal for the introduction of genetically modified organisms' environment law (GMOVS) and the amendment of plant protection law.
The amendment defines the establishment of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) agricultural sites and for operators, using the register of plant health.
In addition, the obligation of the GM farmer to have an earlier agreement with the person acting with the consent of the radio operator shall be amended.
Although there is currently no growth in genetically modified agricultural culture in Estonia, there is a need for clear rules for genetically modified and non-changed agricultural cohesion.
This is at least until Estonian GMOs have decided to preach for free," said Sigmar Suu, director of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden associated with both the private and the public sector," added Suu.
The draft legislation repeals the provisions relating to the location and training of the GMOVS in the GMOVS with respect to the data collection and processing of operators, lays down the requirements for the operation of the GM agricultural culture and the start-up of the economic activity.
In particular, in relation to the measles, the GM farmer shall be replaced by the same obligation to inform the GM growers of the obligation to obtain the machinery from the start of the growth of the GM crop before starting to grow in the appropriate agreement with the machine.
The draft legislation is sent for coordination to the ministries.
All interested parties have the opportunity to meet this in the information system and, where appropriate, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The proposed changes affect, in particular, the people, the machinery and the Agency working in the field of plant growth.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop has been allowed to grow - May MON 810.
However, no one in Estonia is currently interested in the growth of the GM agricultural culture.
For this reason, there has been no shortage of maize in Estonia, a European reserve for maize with MON 810 resistant.
Also, the Maisilin series are developed in southern regions, and this sea is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015, and 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture has commissioned studies to find possible GM crops in the various species of Suvirap, Mei and Soya in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds were not included in the network, and as a result of the study, it was concluded that the seeds of the species that grew in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In the past, it may be concluded that there is no known genetically modified agricultural culture in Estonia and it has also been confirmed that there has not been any case-by-case pollution.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester Uniteds of the Nemanja Maticu form "geneuse"
Jose Mourinho believes that the Manchester Uniteds have colored Nemanja Maticu in the face of "geneity", after the midwife of Sampdor three days ago did her debout.
40 million songs from Chelsea, a player bought from Dublin United in the last summer of the game before Uefa Super Cupi Real Madrid won 2-1 in the second day, publishing the prize in a defense role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were allowed to go free of attack.
However, having remained away from the Blue Sea coast of Asia, Maticul was desperately in need of a massage and only 45 minutes before Mourinho said it must be improved by the beginning of the spring of Premier League.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genius -- he has legs," said Mourinho.
"Let's help him get the shape on his first chance."
Like Matic, the Aviva station also started with the new colorful Victor Lindelof and Romel Lukaku and Mourinho, but instead began to place the hunter as the starting man of their union.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to paint three legs, but he confirmed that the club has already done "excellent work", agreeing with three of his four priorities.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four, but they've seen very hard for me."
The next son of a soybean was born on August 1st and this time in Muhus.
In the case of a resident of Särves, a resident citizen named Mat Martinson, the first fugitive was given to Särves, and this crew is already flying around, leaving the pesa side and joining the Mulutu-Surray with a large shelter.
This is because Sårvez is no longer a fruit tree, writes the Sermon on the Mount.
On that second day, in a relatively short time, the sender had another son and it was on the island of Muhu.
Martinsson said that the installation of the senders is actually an international project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Mullu was provided with one of the boys named Mati GSM in Sörves Turjul.
"His actions are all visible on the Internet: how he went to Spain in winter, back in time to the German and Polish border, and then came to Saarema," said Martinson.
The British explorer allowed the microchib to be installed in his body to access the house and the car
The British explorer got the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could just open up his advantage, get to the office, and even drive the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam was allowed to install a small Kibi between his wallet and the name scheme and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to change their lives with technology.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson's Royal Hospital Consultant-Anesthesiology in the province of Hampshire, Winchester, Hansis, to ensure that the installation procedure is in line with medical standards.
The technology compares to the cassettes and dogs with the microchib that is installed and the procedure costs at least 30 seconds.
Northami's company also exchanges the numbers of houses and cars to connect them with the Kibi, asking one of the 300 songs.
This marriage of one child's father has installed technology for both home and his car BMW Z4, which runs when he's in role.
The White House exposed thousands of taxpayers to pay
According to the military documents published in the TIME, the White House decided to fly a heavy helicopter last month for a company that marked America's production for the south-east winding to pay off $24,000.
The green and white color of Sikorsky VH-3D, called the presidential palace at Marine One, was a central milestone for the event of American construction programs in the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House senior officials reviewed industrial products in their rounds from all 50 countries.
The helicopter built by Connecticut was exposed together from Maine, a fireplace from Wisconsin, and a coffee shop made in Mississippi.
According to documents issued by Escaadr Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) for the operation of helicopters, the White House’s military headquarters required the use of the helicopter’s location or 36 hours prior to the use of the helicopter’s "unusual" event by the south-east wind.
"I know that you would be aware of this, because it's extremely important to the company," said HMX-1 commander on the day before the event in his e-mail address, the manager of the seaman in the area of flight.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the south side of the lake on July 17th in the morning at 7 a.m. to 15 a.m. and will remain there until the wind is washed between 18 and 21 at the same night.
It was added that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, it would be necessary for the rest of the working time limits to be restored.
The original flight crew was at the airport during the operation, and the Essaadry security team stayed in close proximity to the aircraft throughout the time of its arrival on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the TIME newspaper whether or not the other team was finally required or not.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that in the HMX-1 study, if the test is given, this sentence may be violated.
"We asked if it violates Hatchi's law, and told us not to do it," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," said the commander's commander.
The White House was officially a "made in America" campaign, and the Hatchi law would not cover it.
But even official events are political undertones.
At that time, the President supported the efforts of the health reform during the session and thanked the Government for its efforts to comply with the rules of the government.
The use of a vehicle known as Marine One or Air Force One for political input is no new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a pure photosenic is unacceptable.
Trump caught attention in February when in his first campaign in Florida Melbourne, the president's plane was hit by a storm, and his Twitter account is covering messages that deceive him about how his predecessor used the planes of the president.
"Valgel Home has a very good idea of the "America made" exhibition, where products from all 50 countries that have been made from American materials have been produced by American workers," said White House Press Commissioner Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams are often in Washington and on the south side of the river trying to use the package to reach the White House of Presidents of the United States with a sensitivity.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 White House organized 58 testing.
According to the official, the flight to the "America" aircraft was considered to be among the standard for the six-month training.
The Eskaadr helicopters flew that day for another 11 hours for "non-presided support missions".
According to the White House, no one else in the company's exhibition was charged to pay the taxpayer's money.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of the solar exposure on the south-east of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the exact cost of the president's flight budget documents and the precise costs arising from the establishment are difficult to explain.
However, according to the budget estimates for 2017, the Ministry of Defence is a compensation amount of $24,380 for flights.
The Eskaadri documents indicate that the airport was a short distance from the main airport of Quantico from the coast of Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is heavily below that amount.
"The calculation of the cost of taxpayers is very expensive on the basis of the estimated remuneration rates," Walters said.
"These valuations include staff, maintenance and many other non-recurrent costs taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personal costs, but they cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
White House former President Sean Spicer protected the use of helicopters at that time.
"The idea of the season is to show that thing prepared in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very concerned that they are contributing to our national security and that there are an estimated hundreds of thousands of people who depend on it.
And I believe that just like most American classes, we are all threatened by this helicopter and other military equipment, where so many Americans have found it hard.
So, of course, it's right to raise it."
It is not clear whether Trump's absence in the south-eastern corner of the operation was a roundabout with a helicopter or not, but he was sitting in the back of the train.
The White House turned to the representatives of Trump Sikorsky, referring to the media brands of the company’s products on his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorksky very well," said the president, "I have three of these products."
Grit Shadeiko - the peace and happiness that will be achieved through the whites
In 2011, MMil Daegus met Šadeikot in the last area, 800 m, and was taken to the railway station.
Just before that, he had received a zero in the university hidden in China.
The failure of Helsinki EMI in 2012 was due to an accident, but in London, the debytolymium considered received it at point 23 of 6013.
There's no way we're going on.
After the opening day of 2013, Moscow MMil received an extension of the snowfall in Estonia's record graph.
Two years later he got to the MMil of Beijing and fulfilled the Olympic norm, but it was more of a sportish failure.
The most difficult situation was that of Shadeiko only when he had not initially received a letter from the Amsterdam EMP.
I'd just like to add one regular multitasking once or twice.
One time," at the White House.
Worse still, a month later his Olympic Games ended because of the Rios revolution had already begun.
It's time to take the seven-year-olds off. Do you want to keep up with the seven-year-olds?
Is it still worth all of this for two days of effort?
She thought for a long time, but she found peace.
I got to think about it.
This experience is relatively hard to describe, but I have thought that the past summer and Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Happily, it was time for you to take care of yourself and keep your head clean.
"I knew I wasn't going to put my house on the pill," Shadeko says about his own cleanliness.
I've got a clean bed and I've got to go on with the new shoes.
Trainer Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to see the suffering of care, but he understood that in particular the athlete must be able to reach his own point.
He was so impressed by all of them.
It was hard to find.
"But Grit said he didn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Megi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his pleasure.
The withdrawal came back in May when the Czech Republic imposed a new Estonian record of 6280 points on Götzse's multi-stakeholder.
In his high-level contest, he improved his personal tip mark by about a meter (13.89) and during the record time period.
Then the divers realized that this was not some kind of power rule, but was removed from the first stage of the struggle.
He's been running for years, though, says Sweden's a model student.
He's ready for sports, he's good to train.
If something's going on or wrong, he's gonna say it right away.
He feels his body and trusts his feelings.
You have to get out of this.
I can't say exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
The new approach has also been found in Sweden.
"I'm not the one who does the training for the maximum," he says and says that it's the most important thing to get a sense of it, because it also ensures good results.
The success of newborns makes them happier
Good emotions have also contributed to the happiness of relatives.
His former trainer, Maris Mägi, and Sister Grete, had recently become a child nurse, and a multi-stakeholder has recently received new support from outsiders.
"It's been quite interesting," says Shadeiko.
One of the alcohols that is given to the brain is "training".
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is so rich in wine that believing wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neurotheist at Yale University.
His message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the “very active” wine taste process.
As the class grows, the wine succulent, the taste of it, and the taste of it, and the aftereffects, we put our brains at work to create a taste for wine.
The Sheper’s statement does not actually contain the taste of wine, but the taste is made of how wine stimulates the brain.
He's comparing how the brain "sees" the color.
"The sweet isn't wine, the taste is sweet," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, the seed, and even the soil of what a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, seems to think that wine isn't for you to drink.
"It must be stronger in action," he says.
If you're taking too big a shot, the system's overloaded.
Too much wineing can harm the brain rather than benefit the brain - people who are at risk of over three classes of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced spirituality, according to a 2004 study.
10% of Estonian ICT sector employees receive less pay than colleagues
The personal data of the Fontes Finland show that 10% of Estonian ICT workers receive less pay than colleagues.
Ten percent of the wage is between men and women, writes the portal Geenius.
The source of the ICT sector’s remuneration study involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
There were 8,577 officers under consideration.
63% of staff were employed.
"While only 3 companies claimed that wage unemployment is for men and that the rest of the companies do not have wages for them, in reality, compared to the same work among men, the main monthly rate is 10% higher for women and the average annual average for men than 8% for women," said Fontese analyst Ilmar Pühjala.
"Narcose" 3rd season advertising time: now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix will arrive at the central Cali cartel
Despite the discovery of Pablo Escobari's killer in the second era of Narcose, Netflix's line has not been over.
The third and fourth watch hours have been confirmed by the emergency service, and the first of which has already been set up a advertising clip that breaks the line with new bad ones.
At the third half of the year, DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug organization - Cal cartel.
They operate in four powerful cross-border "like Fortune 500", simply with stronger taxes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is a cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis) is the brain of Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) and is the head of links with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is operating in New York.
In a recent release, Pedro Pascal appears in the address of Javier Penana, a lawyer who steals legal aid from America and Colombia in the fight against drugs.
Other new examples include Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third "Narcose" meeting will be held on 1 September.
According to the UN, Afghan women's democracy is a role in politics
On three days, the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said that elections could only be represented by people if all members of society, including women, play this role.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates for local councils, three are candidates for vice presidents and more than 30 per cent of those recently registered are women.
"The importance of women cannot be overemphasized," he said in a three-day statement.
Elections can really represent and be trusted only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the local councils of Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
Taliban has threatened itself by a electoral process, which will collapse with the transition period, with the role of international military operations as an advisory role.
This year's elections mark the first time in which the power is granted peacefully to one democratically elected government over the next.
Haysomi said that women's strong role in the advancement of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing.
In Afghanistan, the independent electoral commission data contains 3,6 million registered women of 1.2 million.
The joy of sharing makes all things more urgent for both the large and the small.
At the same time, there are always too few trains, but train trains provide a good opportunity to combine assembly, game, approach and burden.
And whatever a comfortable solution - wherever you're sleeping, the living handys are always with you, and they'll come with their faces with their voice and no matter what they say, "Let's train now!"
Starting with the heat - very good is a normal beauty game or passing the beach bar.
Kükk is the starting point of standing in the form of legs and tortillas - who would like to take a photo of the rest of the fish safe during the winter?
Imperature must be used instead of children!
First of all, it's safe and comfortable, and the difficulty increases at the same time as the trainer's power.
You can also cook with a lot of kids.
The child trains balance, reads times and feels the opportunity to relax and be important.
Older children can make their own bread at the same time.
The size of the movement is placed on the ground with the shaking of the hands and the shaking of the hands.
Keep the rings straight, please hold the minimum regularly.
The child can read times and feel like a trainer.
The plan is excellent, but for the child, it is a permanent exercise that is expected to last forever.
But it's easier to do!
Game plank: take a long ping column from which to jump through.
Actually, it's harder than usual, but it's much more fun to do when you can give a friend a hand.
To add weight, you can stay on the floor, on the small market, and also walk around it.
In addition, it may be written to the children’s trees, but this exercise offers fun for all the children.
At the same time as the crabies in the lion’s nest, they get a triisse, thoracic and skinlike burden.

From the Philippines, the world may travel to the heart of the moefs
In the last few years it has been a fish class that has obtained its own emergency products, which, on one of the right-hand side of the refrigerator, has to be cut directly and which has been made available to the sellers, despite the fact that they have been able to avoid the price at the price of the heat.
It seems that the cave of the lakes is one of the things that has always existed and whose own has not caused special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, there's nothing wrong with it.
Now, however, the olfactors have made a real victory and the moefs have turned their weights of designers into winters against the homes of simple olfactors.
In this case, it is not only with a pilot, but today it is even more popular today, and the braver women are even going to the office.
However, there is a need to make it clear before it becomes clear whether the actual dry eye still sits or pays off the mark and count, however, to avoid the official sumament.
In contrast, divorce has been a major cause of women's true poverty.
For example, by reading foreign moebologists, the first thing left the impression that the moegramans are on the local market in the first place in the holiday season and they call themselves a house where the whole holiday season is on the beach, on the market, and even on the streets of the city.
Some bloggers are so stupid that they buy from the market a bigger cave and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
In this case, it is worth noting that there is so much demand for readers that women (and men!) in the real world may have been attracted to one another in order to make some home a happy owner.
In some sense, it is also understandable that such a tragedy is such because it is rare that it is possible to buy for themselves some of the most modest euro in the world.
True, skilled merchants have also found a simple financial service opportunity here and thus sell smaller luxury brands for some euros and thousands of dollars.
Apparently, even more wealthy customers should not be aware of the mere fact that they are promulgating around the houses of some of them.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana worth over a thousand euros.
However, for the translation of the Channel, it may take up to EUR 6000.
Unlike most of the moose, the algae did not grow tall, but some of them were much older than they were at first.
These are said to be from far away from the Philippines, where they have been scattered.
In particular, it is not uncommon to be surrounded by explosives and locals.
It is unlikely that it will be the 14th century of the oil mining industry and, however, it will be the result of the normal pollution.
However, since the clay must not be as strong as the potter’s clay, it can be made into patterns and other materials that make home more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, in recent times there are particularly trendy cats, where colorful feathers or skin crests are wrapped in.
In particular, a letter of appreciation may be sent to the sampler Jane Birkin, who had never seen the largest rededicator in the world.
In his name, he agreed to go to the Cannes Film Festival for all possible clothing complexes and did not have much to do with it.
Today’s population is no less important than the fact that care for them is expensive and, unlike all other peoples, it is not necessary to care for them with special resources, but it is also necessary to remove the water and the mark.
As with trending jobs, the brands that came out of the classical era have come out with all possible translations.
For example, if you wish, you can call yourself an alkola of a ridily or in a state of shock.
At the same time, it is worth noting that a classic debt doesn't go away from the tree, but it does.
But what's a classic debt?
For centuries, it has been viewed as a classicly covered house with a wooden roof, which reminds of its style, is open above and has shorts, as well as a roof.
Five of the healthy wastes that are in the house to prepare
Lifehack.org produced ways to prepare different kinds of residues in the home, which contain less calories than waste.
Sidruni and petiazejäts - to wash with a large white sidedrum with sugar, add fat and sugar and mix all in the same mass, put salt in the refrigerator.
The chocolate and chocolate butter - bluffed Greek yogurt, frozen bananas, cocoa powder, and whet reach the same mass.
Then add a piece of earth’s crust and blow in a couple of seconds.
The rest is ready to eat now.
To mix fatty milk, sugar substitutes, eggs, frozen or standard formulae and manicure extract into a uniform mass and set the salt into the refrigerator.
Coco-containing - to bludged cocospam, cocosmos, fertilised extracts, walnuts, and frozen bananas, and to put the juice into the refrigerator.
Bananas - mix frozen bananas with a low fat equivalent mass, serve with Greek beans and immediately use.
These were favorites in the real estate market - styled, expensive, and luxurious!

A missing man was found on the island for three days.
Aare left her home three days a night in the unknown direction of Karla's apartment.
Arare was on the phone last contact last night, and the telephone positioning gave him a place in the West Saare Valley, a visit to Münnus, where he was searched with helicopters to the heart and dogs to the early morning.
After that, his phone was empty, and the man’s location was no longer possible to be determined.
The police continued their search this morning.
The police will thank everyone who helped to find Aare.
GMB cancels after investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects the purchaser McVitie's direct confirmation of long-term production plans in the company's company Glasgow.
According to the GMB Scotland, the company has changed to the future of the investment of the Tollcross object.
In the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cooks and other products are produced, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've invested in the object over the last couple of years more than 5 million songs.
There, workers and the head of the company were paid "I'm the first to hear" if anything changes in action.
In a letter sent to the company's objective owner, GMB Scottland referred to the service of McVitie's company "response concerns about the fact that the funds are not used to modernise manufacturing lines".
"The fact that we can't find the object's head clear about the business needs of Tollcross and the future investment plan makes our members much more concerned.
There have been a number of generations of families, and the labour force consists mostly of local communities and people around the Glasgow, as it is essential to ensure regular employment in a region where higher employment is and manages social exclusion.
Therefore, Glasgov needs an old-age job, pay and welfare position and the growth of Brexit, housing costs, and the rise in production chronic deterioration of production, with a rapidly growing industry in McVitie's."
The representative of the Pladise said: "Tollcross's objective was to receive a letter from GMB Scotland last night, and the company is responding directly to it because we value the active relationship with the workers and the representatives of the company.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between Tollcrosses workers and representatives of GMB was held, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all the other companies that operate in a highly competitive and unfair economic climate, we look at our activities over - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over 5 million holes in the Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and operations.
We fully understand the origin of Tollcross as a production object and if there should be any changes in the operation, the workers and the representatives of the company are the first to hear of it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about coming to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain did not give up in an attempt to lure Neymar into his race, making him an offer of 189 million lashes. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking decree?
This kangaroo approach has opened up a massive transition period, and the League 1 club is ready to clear more than twice the current world record of the transition, which was established in the past year by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester, United States, for 89 million songs.
If the transition has been completed, Neymar will eventually become the world's most expensive player and at the same time the highest level of professional sports in the world, which will be earned after payment from PSG over 500 000 songs a week.
Barcelona is known to be angry at the approach of both the way of approach and the free movement of Neymari, although the source of the approach to the Catalan government confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football club since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of PSG warn the world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the conclusion of the agreement with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif kindly warned all clubs that are thinking of some PSG's best player's recruitment.
"I don't worry, because they know that if they touch some of our players, we'll take them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with some of our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have fallen above this border because the Spanish club had previously shown interest in PSG's midnight champion Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they are not allowed to leave Italy under any circumstances and that Barcelona can gain this interest in the resulting recovery by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymari.
Masters: Ireland wants to build a mirror after Brexit, not a border.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike the gap between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar, in his first letter to Northern Ireland, warned in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border tariffs have changed the possibility of free movement of current people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build a light, not a limit," he stressed.
As the speaker said, he would prefer to remain in Britain instead of the European Union, and since this cannot be achieved, then to remain in the European Community.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom of Great Britain would be another opportunity to change the departure of Great Britain, Ireland's Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said, "We could certainly have such a UK".
The alternative would be to return to customs points that would include historical delay and political transition.
"Finish trade, justice and peace," said the Prime Minister of Ireland.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of North Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met in Belfast on a visit to the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
The first half of its triathlon passed by Mart Avandi: Ironman can pass through everyone.
Today, the Baltic Sea is considered to be the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic Sea, where about a thousand triathetes of over thirty countries were present in the Jordanian conflict.
The distance of 70,3 miles was 1,9 km from the train, 90 km from the train and 21,1 km from the train.
On the other hand, he successfully finished his first triathlon of his life as well as Mart Avandi.
"I thought it would be complicated, and eventually it would be complicated," Avandi said at the end.
Despite the difficulty, Avandi was convinced that the triathlon is actually an ideal for all.
"Not a distance will die, but a speed will kill," he said, assuming that with the power rate, everyone will get to the end.
Except for Ott Sepp: "It's all right with the body, but the best can't swim."
Avandi had already received a train from February.
It's been four to five hours a week, but it's been ten hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he reached point 270.
Although Avand lost both Raio Piiroja (04:59:53) and Jürgen Liig (05:06:37) he won the other so-called "prominent class" battles.
Last year, Tanel Padar lost Advandi with seven minutes (05:41:54), journalist Stan Teppan with 16 minutes (05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm with about an hour (see 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
John Moldan at 3:58:27, of the Estonians, was the best Ivo Big at 04:14:09.
There was a victory for women in the Italian Helle Frederick's time at 04:24:01, but the Estonians, Maria Jennese, who lost Frederick for about half an hour and got the time 04:58:58.
The opening lasted 1.9 km long with a walking distance of 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410.
