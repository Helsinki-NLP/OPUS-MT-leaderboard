Tom translated a document from French to English.
I'm about your offer.
I heard you talking to Tom.
Where's your father?
Show me that.
What cheese do you want?
What's Tom's chances?
I hope that's enough.
I saw Tom before he saw me.
Can anyone pick up the phone?
Why isn't Tom happy?
I promise to bring her back.
What's in the folder?
We were happy to play baseball.
I drank coffee.
Are they for food?
That's a stupid question.
Health and happiness enjoy beauty.
Come with us.
What's the minimum wage in Ireland?
Although we don't have much money, I want to buy this picture.
Tom's not a conscious man.
Where's your father?
Would you read that to me?
I'm poor.

I didn't imagine Tom was so angry.
Ellen was running alone.
Can you read French?
I think that's true.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Am I wrong?
Our theme for the week is: . . .
Even wise people are sometimes surprised.
"This is my first flight, I'm nervous," said Hiroshi.
I guess you're hungry.
Let's have tea at 3:00.
I read this book.
You were always a little weird.
You're going to train outside.
I can't fix the refrigerator.
Where's your father?
This book isn't Tom's.
Be very careful about this.
I just want to be able to speak French a little better.
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
Yomi will be a teacher.
I heard Tom and Mary talk about it.
Why don't you put on your dress?
How do you feel about his relationship with us these days?
Any more free places?
I think you've done enough.
Tom's got his jacket cut off.
Mary threw Tom's eye on him.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.
Let's leave it for another time.
What's going to be the time tomorrow?
I'll clean up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.
You know, it's funny.
Thank you so much!
I don't care what you think.
These bitches don't relax when they're gone.
I was judged.
She keeps crying.
When she lost her mother-in-law, she returned to her old job.
I forgot to lock the drawer.
There are more important things for me.

There's something in Tom that I don't like.
I just got it.
I'm looking for Tom.
Tom didn't kiss anyone.
Tom has a map.
I bought it.
I've learned enough.
I've been working with Tom for three years.
She's committed to her attempt to buy the beer.
I don't like anything Tom does.
He doesn't leave much of his life.
Tom wanted Mary to learn French.
What did Tom bring with him?
Are we leaving soon?
A man must fulfill his obligations.
It's never been on the island.
I think that'll be the best.
I'm glad to hear it.
The idea we discussed in class yesterday really attracted my attention.
What would happen if an unexplained force hit an impenetrable object?
Let's play.
Why did you decide to deal with French?
She's been out of school for five days.
I'd like to continue with French.
I'll graduate tomorrow.
Let's hope so.
He looked back at me and hid himself.
Go get ready to lie.
It's not a weapon.
This palace is underpaid with the skin.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Speaking French is a great fun.
Did you actually try?
Hello.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you free.
You better not go.
This year's late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much less.
You didn't give me as much rest as you should.
I could be able to find time to help you.
Tom found it.
Tom wasn't very busy.
It's been five days.
His clothes always smell bad.
I have different things to do.
She's born a boy.
All the flowers are beautiful on the day of their wedding.
I heard you're sitting right, it's bad for your back.
He's financially independent of his parents.
What's their purpose?
Great idea came to my mind.
My goal is to become a teacher.
Happy Christmas!
Tom didn't want me to leave Mary.
Let's ask her something else.
Ken's good at swimming.
There you are.
The bureau's holding the bag from his hand.
Please leave immediately.
Did you smell me sweet?
She was worried she might be late for the train.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and arrived.
Come in.
How much is this sugar?
Tom shut the door.
I need to get back to work.
Looks like Tom like his new job.
Trier is the oldest town in Germany.
They're always missing school.
How high is this mountain?
Please close the door when you're out.
You go ahead, I'll get you later.
Have you ever been to Nara?
I'm really tired.
I only have ten books.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
Excuse me, how much is this?
It's time to discuss your past.
Will you come back?
I'm starting to understand it's gonna be impossible.
I've been waiting for three days.
He had no idea when he'd start.
The dark clothes are wrapped around the body.
I'm pretty busy.
Go on this show, and when you get to the lighthouse, turn left.
Tom knows I'm home.
Don't let this happen!
Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
Be careful not to fall.
You're my best friend.
How old is Eiffel's neck?
We'll solve the question.
The boy loves his parents.
If I had a choice, I wouldn't have done that.
Can you meet me with a lawyer who speaks French?
We printed 50 numbers from the invitation.

He's very mad at you.
Can anyone answer my question?
I don't know where yours is.
Does anyone here know French?
He called me a cab.
You're going to London next week, aren't you?
He also speaks French.
Tom loves horses.
Why did you decide to deal with French?
You'll need it again.
I'm happy for her company.
Did you pay your phone account?
We're done, so we can walk.
Give your home!
Nothing interesting is happening in this little town.
I know someone who speaks French very well.
Happy birthday!
Oh, now I understand.
Talk to someone else.
Tom went to the doctor.
I don't care why.
My shirt's getting worse.
Karen's my heart.
They're not so bad.
There was a little confusion in the room.
Tom sent Kate home.
The rice has to be frozen.
Tom won't come in time.
What does he do today?
He's gonna be killed for a while.
One glass of water, please.
You scared me.
I have to decide what to do.
I think Tom's doing well.
You don't understand.
I used my parents to ignore me.
I'm extremely busy.
I don't speak French well.
He had a picture in his letter.
What are you wearing in the kitchen?
Tom died yesterday.
We're going to the gay school, too.
He'd give me a hand.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
I think you were right.
Tom was disappointed that I couldn't get into Harvard.
What's your favorite hot drink?
I'm following music at a university in Boston.
Can I take your coat?
I made a plan on our route.
I drank coffee.
He can drive a car.
I thought we could go to the museum together.
Tom got on the wrong bus.
He's achieved his goal.
Is that good French?
You deserve the reward.
Will you teach me some French phrases that I might need?
Are these conditions acceptable to you?
Tom's thirty years old and more.
I paid $30 for that.
Can I take your knife back?
A beautiful woman was built a line in front of me.
Tom and Mary got married three years after they met.

Don't say anything to anyone.
I've seen you play tennis.
Looks like they got caught up in this again.
I mean it.
Just close your eyes.
She kept her secret for herself.
Is that your chemical?
He's gone innocent.
I'm sure you're busy.
I think this should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I gotta go now.
His wish was finally fulfilled.
Do you want to be a reliable user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
They serve great food here.
Tom, where are you?
I'll learn French this afternoon.
I had difficulty solving this problem.
How much time do we take?
They look so much like I don't know who it is.
We've got a lot of bad luck.
Please be patient.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend me some other hotels?
My rain prevented me from coming.
Ken called me every day.
Our departure was canceled.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I don't deserve compassion.
Can't you?
No, it's too small.
He gave me what I needed.
I missed you!
As an adult, I'll marry Tom.
It's gonna be a start.
How much sugar do you put on?
She seems to have a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom dropped something on Mary's ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees began to cover the list.
Look at my fingers.
She speaks English well, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You don't eat of the cake I made, but your sister eats.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't speak French today.
I think that's yours.
Stand up if you love it.
Who told you my name was Tom?
It's Tomovo.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on the diet.
Speak aloud so that everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Will you go back to the beach after dinner?
She's three years older than me.
I don't want to tell Tom I was in Boston.
I'm proud of the culture and privacy of the Germans.
My friends call me Ken.
Tom couldn't find a job.
I don't want Tom to make things worse.
He was the boss of the situation.
I've got to read this book.
He's married to Stuartes.
Everyone's waiting for you.
What he loves is a wish.
Tom left his family and fell into illegality.
Let's talk English.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
When's the last time he went to the beach?
Don't give up.
Because it's raining, we didn't go to a picnic.
I wish Tom could be here today with us.
I'm home.
Should I open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I have to get to the hospital.
Let me see that.
Our news inspired us.
Is it cold to you?
I've never been king of Tom.
I need you.
I like listening to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak French a little.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll find a job.
Do I have the right to join you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They understand each other well with their neighbors.
Didn't Tom say anything about that?
French is not so hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else offered to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What's the point?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd spend a lot of time together.
I forgot his name.
We're not fast.
She's rather shy than social.
I got to the garage after the train left.
I've never seen Kit alive.
You want to wear my jacket?
I don't think I should ask.
Be brief, please.
That's all Tom's got to do.
I think you should be crazy not to go.
I've spent a lot of time on these people.
I've waited so long.
You obviously don't want to do this for me.
Fresh fruits are good for you.
He has a good sense of humor.
He's finished Tokyo University.
I'm obviously agreeing that you have to move on in your life with your own efforts.
I've seen them around.
Tom's a pretty man.
It's awfully expensive.
Christofor Colum's endless achievements are a threat to Google who doesn't know how to index the innocence when someone seeks Christofor Columb.
Please answer French.
Because of his heart, he did it.
I've been waiting a long time.
Do your kids know French?
I bought some Roman books for the students.
Are you sure you want to leave?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to figure out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.
Did I miss something important?
The patient was healing a little bit.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom asked Mary about her family.
Just through my troops!
What's the minimum payment in Morocco?
We should've arrived already.
You're hurting me.
Let's go talk to the other room.
I have to go there.
I heard Tom's getting married.
Tom didn't even know the French word when he first arrived in France.
Your flight has been canceled.
I heard you talking to Tom.
Are you sisters?
I thought there was something weird.
Are you living here?
I can't find Tim.
I don't feel left foot.
What's in the kitchen?
I've got a confirmation.
I'll come with you.
Please sign here.
My father visited my uncle in the hospital.
That's it.
The soldiers refused to comply with the order.
I heard what happened to Tom.
I'm sure you know you're right in front of a crisis.
I don't have a ticket.
There are no English words in Tatoeba that contain the word "Lego".
Where's your school?
He's got no less than a hundred coins.
I need to find another one.
Take a test.
Am I invited?
I don't have any evidence for that.
I love costumes.
He doesn't have children.
The young girl broke into tears.
Are you John?
Your shoes are tied.
I'm lying late tonight.
You decided that.
I think you're perfect.
The primary school will be mandatory.
In case of fire, use the stairs.
Are you satisfied, Tom?
I have faith in you.
Mary likes watching TV.
She's a friend.
We'll be together soon.
She's laughing at you.
Why don't you follow me?
Tom and Mary had a middle-aged wedding.
We always wait patiently for Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love the kids, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to figure out who Tom's planning to give it to.
That's amazing!
That's all you can really do.
It's time for us to take a "dating."
France borders with Italy.
The simple numbers are like life, they're completely logical, but the rules for them can't be found, even spending your whole time thinking about them.
Her father made her tell him everything.
I worked this week all the time.
It's happening today.
I haven't seen Tom in a month.
Can you recommend me some other hotels?
All you have to do is move the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom for a while.
Show us.
He's got nothing to do with it.
Do good to those who hate you.
I think I'm gonna finish this project.
I'm just looking.
The teacher made him stay after school.
The students didn't remember what they were doing in this book.
As a last warning measure, I fell and fell into the ditch.
I've never had such problems before.
His car's in two years.
I don't think Tom knows French.
It won't be that hard to convince Tom.

If it were up to me, I wouldn't be interested in it.
I'm not jealous.
I'm having trouble with my back.
They're gonna make a party for Sam.
Jane's president's secretary.
The doctor took over the sick boy.
My French knowledge isn't who knows what.
Who owns this car?
You need to be careful.
Look back.
I'm not a traitor.
Tom was blaming Mary for her death.
The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
This meat is chicken.
I'm three years older than him.
I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was no other place to go.
The man shot her in the face.
One of you'll make me happy.
I can't believe you still have confidence in Tom.
I'm sorry.
We've been waiting for a bad time.
I hear Boston was friendly at this time of the year.
What's your coat?
No Tom, no Mary is in the kitchen.
The growing prices provide the consumer's concerns.
I think you'll like it in Boston.
I heard every word.
Tom dressed his pajamas and fell into bed.
He's not going to move.

Tom's house was damaged by the flood.
Don't look at me with those sad eyes.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
You don't deserve much to talk about.
Tom said you're coming.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He himself refused to talk to her.
This drawing is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that angered her.
That's too little.
I haven't seen you here before.
Their coming here was a mistake.
He was wounded in the disaster.
The question now is, "How."
I like to speak French.
There was a wide range of hearings about the attack.
It's too short.
Stop going back to your famous days or stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What does it mean to be on time if everyone else is late?
The windshield blew the rain directly into my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll be all right.
That's not a problem.
Are you leaving the bunker?
Looks like there's no one at home.
I'm gonna have to cancel this request.
So you're just not gonna do anything, are you?
What time is it?
Every time Mary smiles at him, Tom feels happy.
He has full confidence in the traders.
These are the worst shoes I've ever seen.
I want some cheese.
Learn French every day.

What's Tom's address?
These two roses are made of the same material.
I'm sure this won't happen.
Did you write the house?
I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom doesn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
It's getting closer.
I intend to win.
Many of the children were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a Hamal firm to move things to a new address.

This guide may be of benefit to you on your journey.
Is your clock faithful?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like to be interested in gardening.
They've been drinking coffee for more than two hours.
It's a privilege to be here for me.
Is anyone here speaking French?
I think Tom should start dating other people besides Mary.
Mary just missed the train.
Did you see Tom?
I made the first step.
Watch where you're going.
He's considered missing.

What about you?
It's not that simple.
I've never seen you here before.
Tom feels uncomfortable among strangers.
Number to ten.

Not all news can be bad.
We need help.
Don't they speak French?
You both look very young.
I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my wallet.
Tom didn't have much time.
She's just read all my books.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I see how confusing this is for you.
She hated him.
You're the boss!
Tom can also speak a little French.
I have to admit I was upset.
You don't look so happy to see me.
Can I open a condom?
Learning a foreign language is interesting.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared the list.
I don't care anymore.
That's my brother.
This dress costs money.
Tom's hiding his rice.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look mad?
Tom speaks French.
How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We're here a little late.
Even if I lose my job, I can survive my savings.
It's ours. It's ours.
I have the same number of books as he has.
It's a bad rain yesterday.
I want to love you forever!
I think you should choose Tom.
I'll give you five dollars.
I think Tom's doing really well.
I'm a teacher.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
They were scared of the news.
My nose's broken.
I'm as strong as you.
Get in.

Please explain the rules in the football game.
It's a really stupid idea.
It was fun last night.
Are you happy?
Is there water on Mars?
It's all right.
Tom won't be in the bank at this time.
I don't think you really want to do it.
You seem to have achieved a significant success since the last time I saw you.
The garage's in the center of town.
You're not even working to come.
They're both unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like how you behave.
What are we doing here?
The object is out of the direction of this investigation.
You sat me down.
You're absolutely right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you're coming.
You have to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It'll be all right.
I almost have no French books.
Even though I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
I'm planning on going there.
It's a beautiful red shirt on the front of my room.
I bet you'll be a wonderful father.
Good night!
Someone has to go for help.
They say you're playing good in the band.

Prices fell lately.
When we're talking about travel, have you ever been to Australia?

I thought it was fun.
I've seen other people do it.
There were thirty witnesses.
He cursed her judgment.
I found the key under the trigger.
As long as I understand, they'll agree with us.
You don't have to figure out why, if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard your conversation with Tom.
It's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to take the toothpaste and toilet paper from the super.
You have to work hard.
I don't care about this hat.
What's the minimum payment in UAR?
He's on the diet, because he's having a mild excess weight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You're taking something to drink, you're going through the way with lats to the Swedish table, and you're eating like a pig!
These technical terms are from Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Keep the rocket healthy.
On my way home, I saw it again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were dating Tom seriously.
They won't worry about you anymore.
I don't hate it.
I'm not giving lessons.
It's your turn now.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need some rest.
Tom's excited.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a linguist.
I'd like to find my account.
I heard you talk.
We became friends right away.
Tom spent the weekend in his beach house.
It's your black one.
You know everything about me.
Let me think a little and I'll get in touch with you.
They're interesting people.
Please, call me from time to time.
Tom checked his pockets on his pants.
Hold on to the facts.
I wanted to talk about your evaluations.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's really wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much do you think this field is born?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
You're the right way, you're the wrong path.
Will you give me a fire?
He drinks his coffee every time.
I don't have any information about Tom.
She found a job as a mechanic.
Leave me alone.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should have worked harder.
Her sweater's a lily.
Now that I'm registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, the Americans cannot even solve their own problems, so how do they actually imagine they are capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a hole.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I've finished American literature in college.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
We were worried.
I think you'll be comfortable.
The teenagers left.
I want to be rich.
I've just started.
If you need anything, just call me.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I learned a lot.
She bought a kid's toys.
I didn't get an answer from you.
She had her hair cut in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to take his keys with his fingers on his feet.
His teaching method is good and bad.
I heard Tom's version of what happened.
All I want is you.
I'm looking for a little cup of coffee.
He became a witness to the murder.
I'm flying for Boston tomorrow.
He made it clear that there was nothing in the matter.
I love the party.
That's the camera I bought yesterday.
Cassette fields are no longer fashionable.
I think we'll need more time.
They'll meet in the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please do it again.
That's what I think.
A lot of music doesn't work Monday.
They forced Tom into the hospital to change his stomach because he ate something toxic.
Don't make me do it.
You sat at my place.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Your green one's going.
I bet you know French.
In the evening Tom took Mary to a beach restaurant.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis tonight.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sashayama?
Everything Tom told me was gonna be a lie.
What's going to be the time tomorrow?
Do you have any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could be stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way we can hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like making photos.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a donor.
The girls were dancing in the living room.
She's convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
I ended up in front of the old house and I saw another town.
You won't see anything without a fan.
My father's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit I'm bleeding.
We've been using this insecticide for 2 years.
Come and help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus came empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother's got a nice party.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to leave the meeting.
Tom's hiding his rice and then put it back.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, because she's good with everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Tell me again at any time.
I don't want tea, but coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Would you wait outside?
Can you eat raw cheese?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was judged.
The train went 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact disc.
The director was thinking about the chance to fire Tom, but he decided not to do it.
I've got to cut him off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do it.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible to love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police don't have to pick up supplies.
I was on the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travellers in southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they turn their eyes.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard a phone call.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was mad that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I mistook your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
They all jumped down.
Many merchants were robbed during the holidays.
Why do you need to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We thank you for your help.
Since we wear clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He's visiting his uncle yesterday.
Tom's less than average growth.
I found the key.
I know that's important.
My sister, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful flower.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any prayers.
Natina Tom, I don't know him so well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That part is true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have shoes, but I don't have shoes.
Fuck.
She's my name, Kenji.
I have the information you wanted.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national characteristics.
Rain is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget to feed the dog.
I have to study things.
I'll see you.
I've ever wanted to become an astrophysicist.
Tom's got blood back.
This camera's on Tom.
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
Do you want me to cut him a little?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I really couldn't do it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
With my younger sister at the same time you left?
The sword was abandoned for an unknown time.
His brother taught him a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Did you see Tom?
I want to be taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
The thieves stole the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming from the inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary wear her coat.
That book of the Cabuches could be a love.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He lay down on his lattices.
What's the minimum payment in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's against.
What's the minimum payment in New Zealand?
I'm saving him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His foolish attempts to seduce her showed that he was wrong; she was the mother of two children.
I lost it.
She made the ball for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything he just told you.
We're related souls.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a date with him for dinner.
In the invitation, he wrote that he'd have to have chicken and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
That's why it's gonna help.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the souls?
Mike's running very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was a thief.
Kuala Lumpur wants to visit.
I couldn't make them understand me.
And you speak French?
I've just started to learn French lately, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
One boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the mail.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's sleeping.
Are these explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
There's no sisters.
Tom has little hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men build houses, women - houses.
Where's the toilet?
They usually come back before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I can't take Tom to the bridge.
If I were in your place, I'd ask for this job.
The patient was written by the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We need to keep working.
Hurry up, we'll be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was surprised by her opera song.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
A lot of other tourists have arrived.
The door's broken and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
They look like their cousins.
Don't mess with Tom.
I didn't understand the joke.
I'm sorry you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat this if you loved it?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long he's been studying French, I should be able to speak better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit I'm a little nervous.
Do you want to buy rice?
I think you have the right to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's holiday.
You're not gonna be the only ones there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends with happiness.
I'm sick of myself.
It's done by Tom himself.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
It doesn't carry much baggage when you're traveling.
I've got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
It works both.
Tom didn't come here well.
I'm sorry she lied to her.
It doesn't make sense to be wrong, you know she's playing games with you.
George's very excited about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given advantage before the others.
I betrayed you.
Take it with you.
Just wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
He's playing me public.
The hole's burning.
Tom was working very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Cut it out.
What are you gonna say we're having dinner together?
I think he lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I made at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken to Tom in French.
We all agreed that Tom could speak French.
Tom came back in.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This rice needs to be sent.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I think during the vacation I'm learning to swim.
Where's the beach?
Is Janets playing tonight?
I feel like he won't let me get off that easy.
It'll be 5:30 after a while.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's digging.
The beach's not far from here.
Ken crossed the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
One of you'll make me happy.
When are you going?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right up to the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He lost his last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely removed you from my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum payment in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital where I was born.
Whoever's in the wind, he's gonna have a wedding party.
According to the latest census, the total population of the country is a little over 7 million people.
Time-limits will have no impact on drug dependence.
I don't know where I left my keys.
Among other things, have you ever heard of him?
A death sentence.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I have nothing.
At least once he's thinking about his head.
I decided you could be hungry.
That's the beginning of a new age.
I need to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about this a lot.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you get up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We should have complied with their request.
Choose the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so lie down early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I don't have anything to suggest.
I'm talking to my French employees.
It's a picture of my sister.
Tom's hard to deal with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The apartment was so broken that I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to feel well.
Did the bed go too?
I promise to bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a sliffer.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
What would you say we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The proposal for work is still in force.
There's a button missing on your smile.
I have to get out for a while.
Your green one's going.
Push your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you sell, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My father gave me this watch.
The true friendship is forever.
Tom used to work on the open.
Tom's pressed down.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Is he playing tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm on my way to the bus.
Tom learns French every day.
They're doing kitchen services in this store.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that palace is sympathetic.
Please give me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How are you doing?
I've been through a lot.
I'll stay by myself.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not me.
Any of your team speak French?
Looks like he's gonna start breaking the snow.
I've never seen anything like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never sailed up Fudji.
You're not playing golf, are you?
Tom's not working anymore.
It probably doesn't matter.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What's the minimum payment in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has caused heated debates.
Eat a live frog every morning and the rest of the day will not be worse for you.
Tom won't be interested in seeing you.
The unemployment is growing.
I couldn't move last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's laughing.
If you're going to France, you have to stop French.
I understand what you're saying.
I've never had confidence in Tom.
I'm teaching French at school.
That's what he said.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please have patience.
Your boat's getting too far.
I've been through a lot today.
Christopher Columb piloted unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseballist.
Tom wanted to be unlinked.
I have three kids.
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
My father gave me an hour.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week, I ate pizza every day.
I promise to bring him back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any girlfriends?
You're obviously wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he wrote something.
You want some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I've opened my check.
He was here this time.
I put my shoes right away.
He feels uncomfortable with his father's presence.
Your shoes are tied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you care about French every day?
Don't raise so much noise, please.
You're quite good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to eat.
I'm so happy you're here.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes are all right.
I wasn't going to give up.
That's amazing.
I heard someone coming in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they go to the museum with the bus?
I need to discuss something personally with you.
He was transported to the helicopter hospital.
When Tom woke up, he discovered Mary was missing.
Chia's hair.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony last night.
Jill's agreed for Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In the Spanish, the actuals end with "o." A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
I'm not going to get a hug?
I'm older than any other student of my class.
I'm buying cassettes.
We'll need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and see us.
Will you tell me something about yourself?
Jane has serious problems.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't taken my soul for three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum payment in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get back?
I wash my clothes.
I heard French is a hard language.
I didn't feed myself.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up and lie down.
Come on, touch him.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you learned French?
Carol's back in her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please, be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The plan is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
Get out of the train.
Mary went out with two at once.
There's no mention of Tom yet.
Give it to me.
Can you finish everything you wanted?
You're gonna have to wait and see.
I was up in five hours.
I was afraid I might have been late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom has too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something that's not so expensive.
Tom's much easier to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll put more effort into it.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got chestnut hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never smoked before.
It's a little late.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your service.
Tom's been trying to see if there's any chemicals he can use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We went out after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I want to be young.
Be more precise.
Tom's French is really pretty good.
Isn't time great?
I don't mind.
I don't want to belong to Elita at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to learn hard.
I'll be back soon.
I'm asking Tom.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let him switch to Tom.
He was playing football with an empty conservatory.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your coat.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
So, of course, his ignorance.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are those criminals?
Can you take six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We're gonna set up a forgiving party for him.
What club do you belong to?
Atushi may have been sick.
Tom doesn't get to the bus.
Some books like to read again and again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He's finished Cambridge with a difference.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start preparing.
Did Tom learn French at school?
What kind of shoes are they?
We definitely tried to be healthy.
I'll take my trip to Scotland until it's hot.
He began to justify himself.
How old are you?
It's all right.
Where did it go?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't force me to do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I made at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My father's going to run every morning.
I saw Tom walk through the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't make yourself too fast.
She gave up all her balls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go on.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate any copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful candle.
The fingers of the hand are five: a pallet, a indicator, a middle finger, a nameless and short.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've decided my task with the cure.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
Up-down how much did one cab get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have a lot of English books.
We have time till tomorrow morning.
I like your smile.
Enthusiastically began his worthy respect for the way he was treated.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first his local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more accurate.
I'm a vacation this week.
You're a bitch.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave you blood.
He doesn't know either French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm a whore.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you tell me your name if you loved it?
That kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Do you see the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it's time to leave.
She screams every morning.
Don't forget the holiday tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Oh, that's too bad.
Don't make me nice eyes.
I don't have any money.
Honey's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom's not used to living in town.
Keep Tom under eye.
Jane's out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I can't go.
The long fields now are democracies.
He's doing very well with the kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, the snow stopped and the time was up.
She did not do anything special about Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
Learn French every day.
I heard every word.
Where'd you blow your socks?
Let's go to a movie.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What do we get?
Keep him secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't hope so much.
What's the price of this sugar?
Mom, will you give me the toilet paper?
How did it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you sell, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found out he's a genius in the chemistry.
You can't do it like you're walking alone, you're starting to abuse people's addresses.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I fell into custody, and I couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea Museum.
Tom made a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been a long time since it was empty.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you stupid.
I'm speaking French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not so bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word of support, when you fail, is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His hair was cut off with a sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You're not gonna be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Ankola.
What's up, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
History is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was clean.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One is sure, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told he's got cancer soon enough.
Tom got off the bus.
For me, a meeting last night is a better option.
What are you gonna do?
Tom learned French three hours ago.
Put your hand up.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I often travel.
Here's the hospital where I was born.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's split the prize at fifty-five.
Put my hand down.
I'd like to buy the car you sell, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think it's better to get down.
I haven't seen Tom since he was born there.
I need to know.
Do you like traveling?
Your plan is broken.
Tom made a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished my breakfast.
I have to go and help Tom.
It happens once.
How long are you gonna have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when he was meeting.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get to the bus.
Are you coming, or are you not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the proposal.
Don't talk about people behind their back.
She's grown up.
Come with me to take a walk.
I'll be happy to see the movie.
Whoever's well prepared, there's nothing to worry about.
I was having fun watching TV last night.
Do you have Hobbies, Tom?
These are the trees on which the buried bubbles live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I have news for Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
Put me in pain.
I tried everything I knew.
Why do people fear her?
He's been fighting the hepatitis for six months, but he seems to have just started to recover.
The whole thing is a mistake.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the account?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room's number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they get sick before they get sick.
I wouldn't have thought the tofu was so delicious.
Are you kidding me?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
So what does that mean?
I haven't had the world yet.
He asked you to help him.
I was in Boston only once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm sorry about the weddings.
I can't do it on my own.
You're right.
If you tell her about it, then she will tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell her best friends and finally everyone will understand.
It was cold on her.
Tom speaks with a French accent.
I've never seen a debt.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the moonpark.
I decided it's best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you see it carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone called.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door if you love it.
Tom finally left.
Tom suggested Mary wouldn't come to the party.
It's the sweetest box I've ever seen.
I'm not a bad guy.
It's a good food in this restaurant.
I don't care.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
The unemployed are creating it.
I have to take my son at 2:30.
The sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a big hit.
The prices have finally fallen.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to kiss me?
If you're late for the transfer of control, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
It was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I can't move Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where are we going?
You can't worry about it.
I got the cat for the door.
Looks like he'll win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There's been a lot of jabees in this lake.
I understand it very well.
Depends on the context.
Has something changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read French, right?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's hungry?
The girl eats bread.
I love the buyers.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you that dress.
I heard him coming down the stairs.
A friend will come to the guest tomorrow.
I hope this will happen.
Maybe Miss Satou sent the flowers.
Get us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to agree with Tom.
How long are you going to bother me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can learn here.
Let me help you.
You'll be there!
I'm afraid I touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's lost his life.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put those shoes on, if you love them.
I heard it was good.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's with Russian hair.
I don't know when he's coming.
Mary told John the secret.
The next semester will teach French.
Tom won't say a word today.
I'll see you tonight!
I'm done with my money.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing's ever going to happen like you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children should be subject to their parents.
Are there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come in on Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
No one raised the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning Spanish.
My new bike costs 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it up till later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so superficial.
I have wonderful news.
It looks like it's raining snow, isn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel fell because of the earthquake of the previous day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary used to speak Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never wrote letters.
Close the damn door!
We played for him.
John came a week ago.
He rejected the proposal, and so did I.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
I'm sorry, I have a request.
The brasner is a man who pushes his arms and lowers men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
Not all of us are so stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are patient and patient.
Tom started to learn French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives somewhere around.
Tom loved to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom's not lying on the ground.
I think we can handle it better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm the most common office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen your cancer?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often goes to school.
The wolves are dying.
When are you gonna get married?
That's a fascist.
He's out of the train.
You're tough.
How many times did you watch the "Wan Piss"?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that a big difference?
You can make photos outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're sweet and sweet.
My sister lives in Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
It wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the colors of her tennis.
Hey, man, I'm begging you a lot - go on with a little insecticide behind the refrigerator.
She told me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of hats in the bag.
Soon after that, I started to cry.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permission.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're satisfied.
When the conversation ends, he tells me a friendly meeting and wants me to have a good evening.
Let's check it out.
He's done a good job up here.
I prepared dinner last night.
Tom can't fix it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
I'm very grateful for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him.
I have a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them out?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for the hour.
Let me explain what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my place.
I've already tried that way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students don't have to use this toilet.
You've come into a vicious series.
I want to drink something.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for another, except to take care of the baby.
I'm glad to meet you too.
The film wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.
I don't think Tom's number is in the indicator.
Can you do it on your own?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
I'll meet her after dinner.
These containers are closed thermally.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's no one.
I want more information.
Are you wearing a gun?
He says he avoided the danger by shooting at the dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Watch out for her.
Don't shoot.
Isn't that amazing?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You have to learn harder.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He's trapped in a house.
I came later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was so scared.
I was your mother's first friend.
The quarantine broke our unity.
How much money do I take with me?
Tom lives with the French.
I'm falling for stories like that.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just selling.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these bitches?" - "To my sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a tall, strong blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
The doctor told him not to eat between the main meals.
Is there survivors?
The cop's on her feet.
We chose Jack as president.
This is my friend Tom.
They've been upset with each other.
Tom's a French teacher.
We're going down to the next garage.
Tom asked Mary to meet him in his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's with a light skin.
Thank you, that's all.
The engine doesn't want to burn.
I've got it.
Let's go to the closet.
Jesse just accepted the invitation.
Jack Niclson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there a free will?
I'll be there.
I think this is Tom's motorcycle.
I have to go see Tom.
It's been so long since I've had such a wonderful surprise for me.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we have enough time.
Yonko's a nice girl.
Let's eat.
I've waited so long.
Aren't they sweet?
I can't change these plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was on his way to work.
I had a little temperature this morning.
The medicine works.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is that the right direction for the museum?
The school starts at eight and a half.
It happens twice.
Deep breath is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We were wrong to worry about you.
He can't read.
You're doing pretty well.
The courts won't solve anything.
Maybe it's a mistake.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and memory of the new words.
I think they know us.
I don't intend to hurt you.
Can you meet me with a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was with red flags.
How about a beach trip?
These dogs are big.
You all say "sirene."
Tom won't pay for it.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the stairs to school, and in both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
That won't help you.
Just do what Tom says.
Prisoners were released.
Watch out for that.
I can't see anything.
The congregation was abandoned.
You don't have to run.
It was a wonderful day.
How old was he?
That's off!
Tom doesn't see you.
I wrote to my French teacher.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay for dinner.
I forgot her name.
I think you'll be comfortable.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Then where's the problem?
It wasn't that hard.
This is business.
Please close the safe.
She cut me off.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to learn French.
Tom gave Mary a visit.
I think it's better to stay with Tom.
Tom didn't do it.
That's the job I've chosen myself.
I think our gas is over.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We hit the car.
What's the minimum payment in Germany?
We have something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pig.
Your coming here was a mistake.
The reporter publishes a profile of his new editor.
It's been missing from the very beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka Airport to Germany.
The boy laughed at the girl.
Please don't pee.
I saw Tom around here.
I need to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't been in love for three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's get together.
I just created a new text-processing program with words that can be produced on the inside.
I'm sure we need Tom's help.
Please, give me the hat and clothes.
You don't have to go back to your house.
I'll be as young as you.
I was surprised at how well Tom French spoke.
Tom lives a little below the same street where Mary lives.
The new teacher is in the classroom.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.
I think I told you never to go there alone.
I think you'll be surprised.
He's in jail.
I think your answer is correct.
I don't speak French as freely as Tom.
It's Mother's Day tomorrow.
Choose the one you like.

Can't anything be done?
I have some information.
I love French.

I'll bring it.

Here's my sister.
You're gonna regret it.
No one in her school is better than her.
Is there a big house?
He's drinking too much beer.
She's very nervous and she's worried when she's somewhere at the party.
I think Tom's a good name.
While I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your smile.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know that?
Tom can hate it.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think it's better to give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to provide good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's hungry.
Are you going to London next week?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't mind that.
You don't look so surprised.
He's obviously working.
I need to teach Tom about it.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumps through the window.
To tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.
I gave them clothes and some food.
You've broken your pockets in the back.
I'll be up early tomorrow.
You like French, don't you?
At least get her over the car.
Tom's not like them.
I left my credit card at home.
It's too hot.
It's your blood.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She eats apples.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the shop.
Are you all right?
Why don't you take a sugar for every case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm not right yet.
Did you finish your breakfast yet?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about it on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The rays were almost empty.
They need more studies.
That's your responsibility.
Come to our guests.
I have to push my car because one of the tires is down.
This rice is the standard size.
Don't play with me.
I put my hand on her shoulder.
From the store to the house, I carried a heavy bag and I used to be ho-o-op-hop.
What languages are they speaking in America?
That's amazing.
Watching the news, she belonged.
Don't be disappointed.
He did it in the morning.
If you're not satisfied with your service, don't leave your box.
I'll remember tonight.
I don't pay enough.
I got up early yesterday.
In the last two months, Tom has been constantly taking places from place to place.
I think you should go out.
He comes here twice a week.
This primary school has a strong football team.
How can Tom not like you?
Hetomi seemed very happy.
Are you a subscriber for some magazines?
I'm afraid I won't make it for the food we agreed on.
That's right!
That's probably the key Tom's looking for.
I had to walk there because my car broke down.
It's still going on.

Let's vote.
The wounded were touched by a line.
Don't move!
He kisses his dog Poppy.
There are people I need to talk to.
Tom speaks a little French.
I think you miss something.
You always sing.
I forgot it in the garage.
I owe him 1,000 yen.
How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten dollars.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Don't tell Tom about it.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom noticed three points.
Do you like walking through the beach?
When are you leaving?
Is there anyone with you?
Tom can't believe what's going on.
Do you have fun last night?
It's said right, he's wrong.
They're already here.
You're sitting in the kitchen with a man.
I'm coming back.
When do I close the museum of art?
I was busy this week.
You're from Sweden.
I thought we'd have dinner together.
Get over it.
Tom's teaching sports psychology.
What do you want?
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
They were playing at Jack's party.
The problem is I don't have much money.
I miss you so much.

Whatever I do, she always says she can and can do better.
He's a football player.

I have no idea how it works.
Can you get me those clothes?
You're so attractive.
I think you're perfect.
The army was supposed to withdraw.
Your success depends on whether you're gonna take the STEP test, or not.
I've always wondered if you'll be back.
Tom never talks about his feelings.
He raised his hands.
A coffee, if you love it.
I haven't heard from Jane since she moved to Tokyo.
It smelled like a beer.
I think you'll be impressed.
He thanked me for coming.
He's lower than Tom.
Can you drive?
I can't speak English. I can't speak Spanish.
Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom's gonna stay a week.
I'm looking for a gift for my father.
The problem doesn't deserve to be discussed.
It was really cold.
"For here or for home?" "For here, thank you."
Bob got home very late.
The elevators don't work.
He wants you to do something like that.
Don't be afraid. You'll be fine.
I took her to town.
Anyway, you'll never understand.
Believe it or not, dust and bademes are from one family.
Do you want to hear something funny?
There are not enough tables in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a student at the university, I never slept on the night before the exam.
I really want this.
I've learned a lot of Spanish words today, and now I know how to say "boss," "bradish" and "colon."
I'm sleeping in winter with two rats.
Let's split it.
I'll be right back.
You can go.
I haven't seen those pictures before.
Tom finds it difficult to deal with such situations.
He doesn't like her.
He has a strong body.
Are you scared?
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
It's Sunday morning.
Tom doesn't see without his glasses.
Are these poor people?
Something's moving down there.
I wouldn't blame you.
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong.
It was over.
I'd like a copy of this report.
Tom's upset.
Sentenced to death.
She's been through a lot of days, floating powder for him.
Was he driving with an express train soon?
Look, you're not late.
Are you involved?
I heard Tom was hurt.
How many episodes of One Piece you've seen?
I heard they caught Tom's killer.
I've really had a great time.
It's time to go.
I'm just thinking about the incident.
I've seen them before.
Why is Tom mad?
He speaks Japanese well.
The director thinks he doesn't fire Tom.
I'll be with Tom.
"How many holy spirits of your birth day?" "Fifty and six."
The scars are wrapped in hand.
It's three days late.
Read it again.
The mind expresses my feelings.
Tom has bad news.
Where did Tom say we should go?
Go wake up, Tom.
I just finished doing my homework in French.
I'm looking for my chemical.
Let's have dinner.
I'll see him tomorrow.
This guy was a jerk.
Tom likes to wear white hats with his satellites.
It's in harmony with my principles.
I don't know why Tom's so hot.
What are the facts?
He asked me to get out of here.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
I've seen you somewhere.
She translated the letter from Japanese to French.
Am I fired?
Did anybody see you?
The village is far away.
What the hell are you doing?
How do you know him?
I forgot.
He's in a panic.
I don't know what to do anymore.
There's no rain from the morning.
There's a hole in my teeth.
Tom's doing great.
He's really saying good.
I think you're making a mistake.
I've never heard Tom complain before.
They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where to go.
I don't have personal space.
We have something for you.
I just finished my home in French.
Tom just made it.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
How old are your cousins?
Your French has improved significantly.
What's in your suitcase?
We'll get married at the end of March.
He raised his hand.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Good luck to you.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He's married to a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Aren't you interested?
That's something quite different.
His brother, his sisters, or he'll go to the garage to meet his father.
I gave up Tom.
He disappeared without trace.
You're very brave.
When it came to travel, were you ever in Kobe?
I have to go to the market. I'll be there in an hour.
Mary's high.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Can the account if you love it?
Let's ask her.
I'm changing the train to the other garage.
I heard you making me angry.
I'll give you this book back.
I don't remember that.
Where did you buy the flowers?
I'm not gonna work here for a long time.
We want our own house.
I have to say it.
The theory should be done.
And Tom, and Mary can speak French.
It's personal.
I didn't talk to Tom.
Tom played his bike.
Tom wakes up with a headache.
You better not go.
Mike kisses baby Richard.
I'm planning on teaching abroad a year.
Can you count to 100 in French?
I think you owe me an explanation.
I need to find another one.
You have to leave now.
The snow was up to the knees.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to see Tom asking for money on the street after he lost all his cash in the garage.
I've never seen anything like this before.
You're not gonna be the only ones there.
Do you understand me?
You speak Turkish?
I put it in your room.
No one's home.
He still wants to come.
We have to give up the honour.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom do there?
I think that's Tom.
That's exactly what I said that could happen, that's what happened.
I was trained in this school.
Good day.
I think that's gonna be interesting.
How long does the shark reach the airport?
Tom thought Mary was unconnected, but she wasn't quite sure.
Go to the park.
She hated him.
Tom's not busy.
Ask an expert.
His initiative was broken because of a lack of funds.
I'm sure Tom can't speak French.
Mike was elected president.
Tom's playing football.
She believes her son is still alive.
He'll play baseball tomorrow.
I forgot the PIN code.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
I wish I had learned French more seriously when I was young.
The aristocracy adheres to the glory of its past.
How many times a day you fly to Tokyo?
I'm not going to be able to take Tom from the other side of the bridge.
I don't do that.
I've seen this before.

She gave me a nice doll.
Don't worry about it.
I think you'll like this one.
The brain hurts me.
Go back to bed.
I have three grown sons.
My girl doesn't know.
Most people seem to move before they know their options.
I missed you.
There's gotta be something else to eat.
I know you're right.
I've never eaten Chinese food.
Aren't you married?
I told Tom everything about Mary.
The baby looked just like her mother.
I don't want to sell my soul to the devil.
Who likes you more, the coke or the pessie?
Tom had his education at home.
My father's here.
He took out his passport.
Tom took another glass of beer from his tea.
Tom doesn't realize how his behavior affects others.

Sodako laughed at them.
You have sympathetic eyes.
Don't move.
The book is small.
Lucy likes to play tennis.
That's something I just have to do.
We missed the event.
Tom put his wallet on the desk.
This book is too hard for me.
Don't bite me!
Tom's eyes are blue.
I'm watching TV.
I'm sure she's right.
Will you take care of yourself?
I have no idea where she lives.
Are these books on Kenji?
We're men.
How's it going with this camera?
Don't smoke in the bathroom.
Do you have an elevator in your house?
Do you have this new book?
Tom, are those yours?
Let's go?
He'll be back soon.
Two places for a common buffet, if you like.
I think Tom's gonna win.
It's kind of funny, Ken.
Are you going or not?
I think we should wait.
My parents would have finished eating before I got home.
I forgot the book.
We taste inside.
Tom couldn't believe what was going on.
My favorite team lost yesterday.
I'm tired.
I've got important news.
They all knew Tom.
Tom and Mary are speaking French.
I made coffee.
Tom didn't say what he was planning to do.
Tom's more than three years old.
I heard you talking to Tom.
I'm just a little excited.
Give it to me!
Tom's always taken.
I wouldn't blame you.
That's totally absurd.
How did you create this?
Shut up and listen.
Doctors have discovered some strange facts.
I'm glad to meet you.
We had no choice but to wait for her.
Are you sure you don't want a little?
It's almost ten hours.
Tom told me he might have heard something, but he wasn't sure what it was.
Are you the new assistant?
I think you're really amazing.
If I miss the train, I'll catch the bus.
Do you really want to swim?
Dropping the trigger can be dangerous.
I'm not a teacher.
He slept well last night.
Don't you have to go?
Wouldn't it happen to Tom to let Mary drive the car?
I'll get him back where he is.
Tom has no one yet.
She asked me if I'd be free next week.
They're calling me Bob.
Last week we saw a funny movie.
This flower is the most beautiful of all flowers.
No one knew how hard Tom loved Mary.
He'll be here soon.
She allowed me to use her dictionary.
He asked me a question.
I've seen him before.
Our car broke down last night.
I didn't even get a letter from her.
I think you need help.
I think Tom was born in Boston.
Why'd he take it?
Tom told me he knew where Mary lived.
I think you need a dream.
Are you gonna sing?
I don't care what's going to happen.
I need to help my mother.
Tom thinks I'm right.
He teaches French three hours a day.
Do you know him at all?
"I won't let you hurt my friends!" "I didn't dare to hurt your friends."
I'm sleeping with two giants in winter.
Many English words come from Latin.
We met them in the youth society.
I like to write in French.
Tom thought Mary was free, but she wasn't quite sure.
Is she still here?
That's how I knew her personally.
What could have happened to Tom?
Everything's fine, just like Tom predicted.
Can I sit next to you?
You can go.
I think what Tom did was very brave.
I'm not going to be able to take Tom through the bridge.
Why don't they come?
That's probably the worst.
You're a serious mistake.
How long are you going to the market?
Tom first noticed Mary's musical gift.
Would you help me translate that?
I expect your help.
Einstein wanted to play a bicycle.
Tom can't handle this.
You have beautiful hands.
Ummy's learning English hard.
I waited a month.
There's something I need to show you.
They need some direction.
I told you what to do.
It depends on you.
Do you understand me?
Let the power be with you!
After dinner, I wrote the house.
No one's gonna know.
What's the minimum payment in Lebanon?
Tom was found guilty and sentenced to death.
It's not serious.
Let's speak English.
What day is it today?
Tom can't stay long, so let the meeting begin.
Let's go to hell.
I saw Tom play guitar with his group.
All their efforts were empty.
Oh, my God, I'm late for lessons.
I made a healthy breakfast.
He often writes to his parents.
As a result of heavy alcoholism, he lost his health.
Both plans were rejected.
If the vote changed something, they'd cancel it.
I have problems with German grammar.
Wow, isn't that great?
You don't have to surrender.
The camp's fighting at eight.
Stop being so angry.
I kept singing.
That's cool.
I've got a dog in my eye.
It wasn't that hard.
You have to die.
Did you actually try?
We heard before with Tom.
I hit Tom last night.
Mary came to the hospital.
That might be interesting.
Wait a minute.
He loves coffee without sugar.
I see the light.
It looks like you're right, actually, Tom stole Mary's bike.
Yeah, that's right.
I have an old bike.
Tom won't be able to drive for a while.
It was starting to break the snow.
I like to take an interest in the garden.
The plants were curious because they weren't drunk.
My parents were fed before I got home.
Tom's mom Mary all the time.
My expenses are rising every year.
She's been spending more than half an hour, squabbling her clothes!
I wore my favorite dress for the party.
They fixed it.
All delegates knew they had to discuss it.
Thank you again.
I left the door open.
Tom told me good things about you.
This land is Tom's property.
Isn't that your smile?
I think you should listen to Tom.
I don't think anybody's reading my blog.
Do you still think you'll like it?
Let's catch it.
I love the instrumental music.
I barely heard it.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
I've already written my homework.

Where can we eat?
This rose is beautiful.
I had to pay more attention to what Tom was talking about.
Stop kidding me.
The world is facing the problem of freezing the environment.
It's good to say that Rome wasn't built for one day.

Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm smarter than her.
Anna accepted Henry's offer.

Tom's finally acting weird.
How many years have you learned French?
Take it easy.
Tom's parked in front of me.
Is there a public beach near here?
I've never heard Tom speak French.
Are you ready for the game?
In most cases modernization is slowed down with vesterization.
I don't remember his name.
She stole her tetragrams with girls' cards, so the whole cortex was shining.
How was the beach?
I've got these flowers myself.
They went to the park the next morning.
Don't look at me like that!
It's great to meet you.
I was surprised that Tom was speaking French so well.
Don't go out with Tom.
Where's your father?
Are you sure?
If I were younger, I'd go abroad to learn.
I'd like you to translate this report into French.
Micho was very nice, and you made my car free.
Please drive carefully.
Don't open the window.
We got some interesting information.
I told you everything I can remember.
They don't pay me for it.
Take it easy.
He's been waiting for her call for hours.
Where's the JP garage?

You'll find her.
And the two motorcycles were wearing helmets.
If we have to be fair, he's not jealous.
Tom's finally in the hole.
Tom noticed thirty points.
I haven't seen you in three years.
I'm busy on Sunday.
You should have rejected such an unfair proposal.
Tom let Mary kiss him.

Let me take you to your room.

I think you'll approve.
Did you accept his invitation?
I'll get off the train on the next stop.
Get out of here.
I think you should have a retina.
And I can't do it.
I forgot his phone number.
Tom's the last person to leave his job.
They stole my phone.
No, I want to pay in number.
Did you finish with the house?
I hear Tom was very good at swimming.
Are you drinking?
I wish I knew him.
Can I use your request?
I think Tom did.
I decided you could be my heart.
I heard an interesting hearing.
He's too tired to learn.
I forgot to ask.
My wife gave birth to a girl who weighed 1,500 grams.
Obviously, the hunger is the best adjustment.
Are you taking us for fools?
Tom can't cook.

Did you leave a kiss?
Did you finish it?

Thank you for the pizza.
I really don't think Tom did it.
All I ever wanted was to be left alone.
How many times did Tom call?
I was surprised that Tom was speaking French so well.
It was you, wasn't it?
I don't understand what you mean.
Are you bleeding your veins?

Unfortunately, I almost don't speak French.
It's dark.

Do you love your mother?
I don't think she's happy.
Whatever I say, it won't make Tom change his decision.
I don't understand German at all.
Are these real?
I really didn't think it would be here.
I'll invite Mary out.
Can I ask who you are?
You're kidding!
I told you everything you need to know.
I haven't given up yet.
It doesn't matter.
We don't have that much time.
Tom was laughing at Mary's jokes.
What's going to be the time tomorrow?
Are you ready for the game?

That's really wrong.
I still can't believe it.

I'm guessing you know that.
My mother made a very sympathetic part of me.

I think you should join us.
I made it that I don't know who Tom is.
As far as I know, Tom can't swim.
You're cruel.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
Try whatever you want, you'll see it's impossible to get rid of this habit.
Tom didn't even bother.
Can I trust you?
I'll be here when you get back.
You deserve to be very happy and I will make you happy!
Ten people were in the little room.
He's reviewing my report.
I don't think that's gonna work.

Since it is usually possible to find a lot of websites on a given topic, I usually click the "Back" button when I fall on some website with exciting ads. I just go to the next page that Google offers, and I hope it's less attractive.
The dog dies.
I think you have the right to not let Tom go.
You're talking unlinked.
I want to drink something.
As soon as he finished his job, Tom got home.
You're from Sweden.
Tom did a great job when he went to Boston.
Let me help you.
Tom's mother thought he needed new friends.
Do you speak French freely?
What's your problem?
I hate a movie.
It was just an accident.
Tom and Mary got married three years after they first met.
I want a room from the back.
That's bad.
Tom and Mary like to get rid of the landmarks.
It's not from me.
I missed the last train.
Don't you have fun?
I think you're in danger.
No one likes me, I've never been liked because I'm not beautiful.
Where are you born?
Every time I look for you, you don't.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
I'll call you later.
I'm afraid I'm wearing bad news.
Aren't you nervous?
Let's have some French songs together.
One of his assholes was in trouble.
I hope it's all over.
The birds drank.
At least it made you happy to see me.
What's the minimum payment in Iceland?
I'm better than you.
You won't believe what I found.
Don't!
Prior to initiation of this type of therapy, patients should be taken into account.
I think you should call Tom.
Are you sure you want to burn those documents?
I found a note on my desk, but I don't know who it is.
You've got time till midnight.
Your file is with me.
No one's ever telling me anything here.
I gave every gift.
The museum doesn't work on Sunday.
Your answer is wrong.
She remembers Mr. Black's car.
They put Tom in jail.
My mother feels better.
Tom just got home.
Don't expose him to rain.
They're talking very fast.
What time is it now?
Can I eat this protocol?
Mary loves romantic comedy.
What are they drinking?
Let's be friends.
As far as I know, he must be born in Italy.
"But really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I need to meet Tom.
Even though Tom's English sometimes seems pretty good, he doesn't have a clue where he's going to spend his chances and it's impossible to convince him that he's not right when he's wrong.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you fight with Tom.
Will you call me?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is the best friend of man, inside the dog is too dark to read.
It's okay.
My mother made a very sympathetic sex.
You have to start right now.
It's an old letter.
Are you taking part in some kind of public service?
Do you care?
Apparently, Tom was known before he published this album.
The Romans would have no chance of ruling the world if they had first been required to learn Latin.
I paid $50.
Don't drink that.
I think it's best to get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table now!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
The bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit that he doesn't know how to do it.
I only know them.
They've been in this town for 350 years.
I'm playing a television game.
He was in Japan.
Let's split up with one expense.
Are you still getting mail marks?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, imports were overdue.
You don't have a temperature.
Did anybody tell you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What would a man do like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane's waiting. She's got her back in the tree.
Thank you, we'll give our best.
Let's get up and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes are good for you.
I've learned French for three years.
I think you should go out now.
Please, go.
I thought Tom didn't like you.
Tom looks really happy.
I've never heard Tom speak French before.
She's a Frenchman.
The soldiers were accustomed to the dangers.
I know a little French.
Please enter your contact address here.
Nice appetite!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
Will you make it?
The police found a body thrown out on the beach right away from here.
We all speak French.
The Lord knows the value of his own life.
I appreciate you coming to take me.
Check if you've turned off the TV before you're asleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumps in the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about your life.
It's for you to make things right, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
Corridor's a liar. Watch out.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slovenian roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that to your parents.
Let's say things honestly!
She's the woman I gave her.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This is a funny situation.
This land is Tom's.
I think you should meet Tom.
Don't add annotations.
There's no one else.
Muhahahahahahah, your soul will be mine!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He played a good guitar.
Have you played Maincraft?
Nancy's scared of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medications right now?
The tree's burning.
I heard every word he said to you.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We were willing to drive.
Can I take your coat?
My dad's gonna make my breakfast tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just shut down the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I'm guessing you're busy.
Come see us.
You seem to have had a hard day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to know what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept shooting.
They're working less and less teenagers today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please, don't.
Tom's trail isn't very beautiful, but it's clear.
Shoichi's face is early.
An electric current can generate a magnetic field.
Will it stop you if I include the radio?
I have to do different things tomorrow.
The wheel was broken by dust and dust.
America is very big.
I heard him stop the car.
Follow her my greetings.
Is your wife a blonde, or is she a blonde?
I'm outside, I'm driving my car.
The men took the boy to the hospital.
They talked too fast to figure out what they're saying.
Tom's wounded!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
This is the camera Tom made with the photos.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I gotta go.
What's the whole story?
Don't wake me up.
What are your Christmas plans?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given a chance.
Would you put your fingers in your mouth?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great student.
She wants a divorce.
My new magazine is very interesting.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a trip full of hope.
I'll be here.
Don't move.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the hat.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird for me.
Can you do it on your own?
In the last few days, it's getting longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father singing in the bathroom.
In Singapore, English is spoken.
I'm eating bread.
That request was rejected.
He was right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom won't go to school next week.
Do what I say.
The kids are already dead.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The hole's burned.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I'll always remember your good.
This smell and I've felt it another time.
Everyone's dying.
I didn't understand.
Give me a kiss.
He hates to sell.
I think you're gonna be good enough.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a booked red.
I think you're capable of everything.
He's against her plan.
I don't think we should.
You're not gonna be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it should be.
It's a known mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still in school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
Either you or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell evil.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I was there only once.
Put your jacket on the locker to the door.
Tom lives on three cross-sections.
He's something of little significance.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave him for another man.
Tom admits he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The film wasn't as funny as the book.
I didn't get the job.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole of us called the universe - part, limited in time and space. It takes itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion for his consciousness. This illusion is a personal prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison, widening the circle of our struggle, so that it covers all living beings and nature throughout the universe and beauty.
He'll certainly come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Should I fill in this form in French?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became the director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like each other.
What's this thing?
Never give a dog's food to your dog.
I have problems with French grammar.
I put him in the face.
I'll love you.
You won't believe it.
Should I open it?
Now it's totally different.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were painted in a lighthouse.
Betty killed him.
Did you start learning French now?
You can't read French, can you?
Your blouse is very good with this half.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask again later.
He's my older brother.
She became famous.
She rejected his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll be very interested.
I didn't accuse you of being stupid.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that upsets me.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Tom lives far from here?
Bad time didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
I've got my legs on my feet.
Why is this so funny?
Follow my example and take a cup of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to understand Tom when he thinks he's leaving.
She's reading the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks about changing the world itself.
She wants to get divorced.
You have to learn hard.
Have you accepted his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard the shot.
I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position.
Who translated this for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you give up and get up, you'll feel a lot better.
Did you finish your breakfast?
I have a few old computers.
Tom wondered if she had passed out on her baby Mary.
Are you coming, or are you not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom, and Mary took off their weapons.
Do the cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually sits.
Tom was tired.
You better not go.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a flower that belongs to this juice.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You always complain.
It's dark.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devilish habit must be forgotten.
My brother told me he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have to make a few calls.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you like to close that window so much?
The old two went on a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was left all day.
My math is my favorite object.
What day do you usually feel?
Tom came back to take his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom's back home all the way home.
Did you actually try?
Burya stopped flying on the plane.
Tell me you have good news.
What browser are you using?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum payment on your side?
I think you should think about it again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you gonna take?
Is this your book, Mike?
I'm basically running every corner.
The phone calls in eight hours.
Mr. Smith was accused of breaking the contract.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked about it.
Are you sleeping, honey?
She's kind of a closet.
Five gallons are normal, if you love them.
I haven't been here a lot.
Take care.
That's so big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Are you speaking German?
Put your pants on.
I bought some books from the library.
Be nice.
Yesterday it became a terrible crime.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put down your tourist shoes and don't waste time.
Why did you come so early?
If he's judged on your amazing tank, he seems to have spent most of his vacation on the beach.
It'll probably be snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom may be opposed.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
His luck will end sooner or later.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
And there's no sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time he was traveling with a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can't spend money on the bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
Honey, if the food's not ready by seven hours, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll be right back.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I understand about your party.
They need to change their voice.
Do you want me to ask you a question again?
The book's interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the garage.
What's the minimum payment in Russia?
He loves me.
Try to figure out when the train goes.
You have to deal with French more serious.
I want to go there again.
It's so stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you like music?
He was born and grew up in Tokyo.
I'm doing my job.
She waited until the water closed before making tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
It's not likely they're coming in this late hour.
The teacher claimed that in three months, it would make us all speak French without interference.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
She's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one's talking about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived last night with the train.
Tom's gone, but Mary's still here.
Choose your favorite rocket.
I'll bite you with a snake.
Let's do this for today.
My brother claims he's not afraid of the dark.
Save the man, eat the cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom's speaking French awfully.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
Do you want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me a plate.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I completely forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was on his way to leave when the phone came out.
He asked about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His brain went too far.
Ann's a majoret.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Look carefully at the wall map.
Maybe not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll be very interested.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
I haven't taken my soul for three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a table, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your smile.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Go straight on the road and as you pass the candlelight, you're there.
Do as you want.
Some people would probably ask why we just don't pick up our things and get out of Afghanistan?
You're gonna kill your bitches if you love them.
I don't like ammo.
I'd like to get your picture.
Please, get him.
"What's your car brand?" "Ford is."
I tried to be your friend.
His second cousin was a member of the Jewish governing body.
Would you help me translate that?
America has enemies.
Did you see Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't talked to Tom for three weeks.
Stop fishing.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you're wrong.
He didn't stop standing awake all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have a tendency to travel by sea.
My plane left in six hours.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
That's the way it is.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their house.
I heard footsteps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a list.
Uncle gave me your car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like this before.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
Nothing else is done.
I need to get dressed.
I don't think you understand what's important.
I still don't understand that.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night the game was exciting.
The shirts are the last piece of fashion.
Don't lose.
With a little good will from both sides, our problems should be allowed.
I don't have much money.
She got out on the stairs soon.
The house we used to live in is broken.
I'll get married next week.
Prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In college, my French was my favorite object.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the candle if you love me.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why don't you laugh?
Have you ever greeted PfrsichbÃ¤umchen in German?
It's happening.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this investigation.
Isn't that good?
I don't know French, I don't know Greek.
He made it clear that he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why'd you sleep so much?
She answered through tears.
When are you going?
Hanako grew up higher than her mother.
That's quite different.
The elephant's dry.
He's learning French homes.
Don't raise so much noise, please.
Did any of you ever see Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is married and we want to fix our heads.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Will you eat this box?
I worked hard in the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talk.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This may seem a little overwhelming.
Looks like our water's over.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green belongs to Alice.
We've got our bottle three times a week.
They got their licenses in a trap.
You've made it.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, if you like.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity, but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's already a set.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you learning French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I don't understand.
I need to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You have to use a deodorant.
When I get up, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There's something I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to do this.
You don't look too surprised.
That's a warning we need to take seriously.
What's the label saying?
We'd like to eat.
Let's get some juice.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is used to speaking French whenever possible.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have good hands.
People as a whole are against war.
Your hair needs a boost.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's book?
It's never gonna end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who the fuck hurt you?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You sat at my place.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
In school we learn French every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you're gonna be so surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was thirty years old.
Her hobby is to collect postal marks.
I have nothing.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than we could listen, we would be given two and a half ears.
Don't play baseball here.
I'm holding your coat.
Last night, we had a great time.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often leads me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Don't you fear anything?
He didn't know anything about him since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I put my hands in my pockets.
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a big musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Did you hear about your sister?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, I learned.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think it's better to sit down.
Our sales are falling.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you haven't paid for the accident, please send the debt and let us remove the problem immediately.
He smelled on a toilet here.
I'm here for a break.
Looks like you're on your own.
The question is being considered.
Tom was saved by an accident passerby.
The city is in the center of town.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm so hungry.
It's very nice of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story was interesting.
What are you gonna say to stop the car and get started?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
And both of the results are correct.
I haven't seen a cover yet.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep that night.
Runda's been down for about five minutes.
He used to be around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, and what I'm leaving to talk about.
I'll give it all to myself.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
The diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
Even when he was young, his parents died, and his uncle looked at him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I need to warn him.
Where's the garage?
Don't throw anything out.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't lie.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've got a big knife.
You scared the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches me to arrange flowers.
What a beautiful time!
Don't waste your youth, otherwise you'll regret it.
I think you'll be interested.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
It's hard to get English.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a condom?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is the place Tom was born.
Where are you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea what's going on.
You're all stupid.
They're changing their gifts.
I don't have anything against myself.
Mr. Cooke's Japanese food began to like him.
I put the money in the safe.
Let's go.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to focus on this fact.
That's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Would you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix it.
I went to swim in the river.
Mary is Tom's older sister.
I don't know either one or the other boy.
Guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna be raining.
It was extremely nice!
This isn't your house.
I haven't seen anything.
Hey, I just came here.
I'm a hero.
Damn it!
Tom beat Mary from the corner of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Prepare for the worst.
Let's have the heat under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes in the control.
It's time for me.
Aren't you happy?
We can take some time.
I thought you could quit.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, the car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this powder?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy laughed happy.
He's only in four minutes from here with a train.
What's he trying to achieve, Tom?
Can anyone believe you?
It's a little fat.
It's better to leave.
Tom said we probably won't take too much time.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I learned French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you under pressure?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
Children need to listen to their parents.
It's soft today.
Do you live in this apartment?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of everything.
He returned home after ten months.
Next week, we'll be in Boston.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him last night.
Let's get started here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll get the next bus.
Tom's two times older than Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not so tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the results.
Hurry up and you'll be able to catch your car.
You won't need that anymore.
Get him back where you got him.
Let's get started.
I've broken you.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the bag.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little tired.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So it's still working.
Can you do it alone?
She's exhausted.
Are you so stupid about me?
If you give someone $20 and you never see him again, it's probably worth it.
This is Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum payment in India?
Don't make a decision on this matter today.
She didn't have much money.
You've been sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two roses are made of the same material.
Are you learning French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year, we're going to study in college.
What are you eating, fish or meat?
I made my check.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of DNA expressions, but there's no one for the DNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't lie to your nose.
The wind was breathing on the dust.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her great daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
Of the 20 students, only one read the book.
I've got a job in the middle.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the right to trust confirmed authorities.
I came home from the train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
In what situation would he do it?
What was the name of the one you went out with before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired, and I want you to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He must be the school director.
I'm sure I'll be there before you.
He was supposed to be a clown.
She's in my presence.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio in those days.
She went to the taxi museum.
Look at your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These bitches have holes on the fifth floor.
Tom likes to fly.
You're a good doctor.
You haven't repeated that word any more.
I saw him stop.
She feels like she's wearing her shirt.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
He wasn't so strong.
What a mighty wind!
This is my CD, right?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's out with a group of kids he shouldn't have.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the mail?
My veins are bleeding every time I use the tooth ending.
We got here fast, 'cause the move wasn't in progress.
You must be careful.
What do you miss?
He's back soon from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom doesn't help me.
I haven't been in touch with him for a long time.
Those eyes are going.
What's missing?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
You don't eat until the understanding goes.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at the dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend was a former senator.
Is French harder than English?
I don't care about that pair of shoes.
Are you scared of something?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall through the essenes.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't leave the meeting.
Since when did Tom learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, it's a little bad for me.
I'm so ashamed.
It looks like there's already over two thousand yogurt words in Tatoeba!
Tom's in a hurry.
We can't stop the collection.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cut it here.
I know it's hard.
Are you a exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
Do you think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
It's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind is not concerned about the environment, the environment will destroy humanity.
No, thank you.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you'll be fine tonight.
Don't bring it back yet.
I'm sorry I'm interrupting you.
The fact that he's too generous is his biggest failure.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always seemed like a lot of money.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know it.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It's nothing.
I don't have anything against the hot time.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new visits.
I'm hungry.
Flowers bloom without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you that Tom can't swim.
I forgot.
The account, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Know what he told me.
Salt's done.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go meet him and leave this letter for a while.
This cocoon has finally made no eggs.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
Dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom can't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Young had nothing to say about visiting her unexpectedly.
You have a good mouth.
Many people will lose their jobs because of the collapse of the car industry.
He's coming to me for help.
We'll start cutting down on Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's over.
The moment of celebration for Hansin didn't last long, they were quickly replaced by the first place.
Is there a big house?
Isn't that going to lead to trouble?
He assumed he was called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he miss the test?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they reached?
Here we are, finally!
I'm higher than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I'm gonna have to freeze.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a page on the kitchen window first to get out.
Happy is the man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live that way anymore.
Oh, how sad!
Hi, Jimmy.
Is it good for breakfast?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't force me to shoot you.
The Ecuadorian divides the Earth into two inches.
It was personal.
Don't you mind?
It's a great pleasure to see baseball games.
I think it's good to get some sleep.
When did you start learning French?
She had her hair cut in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna hurt today?
You're so brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them out?
Tom, how does he feel about the problem?
The thief got out of the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera's on Tom, isn't it?
I sent her a bullet.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me a watch.
Please excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm busy.
They're very important.
Are you a Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Move this powder.
I'd better stay home.
It's not very fun.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth opened?
My father drove very well.
We need to protect our children.
I'll see you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you squeezing them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In summer, I think I'm going to France.
Please pull the cards carefully.
Get on the bus for Badstrasse and get off Zeestrasse.
The smile is good for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the one Tom told me about.
Please add this website to the Prepaid.
When the sun of culture is low, Dori and the jungle throw a big shadow.
When was the museum opened?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his dog.
We just cleaned up the toilets.
We have a meeting with Tom in prayer.
I'm not going to be on the threat.
You're a better form than me.
Do you have a Christmas?
I hope it's useful.
He's just trying.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom's working for me.
He's been awake for a while.
Tom's fine.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch where you're going.
Can I get you a knife?
You've got to file the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
Are you armed?
I wish he had told me earlier.
Don't look in the camera.
Well, yet we're going.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water down, whatever it takes to cook a chicken.
What's the name of this river?
Are you free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
There's ice cream in the winter.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm already a full year old.
I want to go.
Get her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want a Portuguese juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like French.
I think we need to make a deal.
I'm just buying soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket case?
I'm really busy.
I think you should come back.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Will I die?
I got a little involved while I was dancing, and I got on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have, how many sisters do you have?
I think that's what you'll remember.
Please turn this into a pound.
I think Tom's lying to us.
Tom's gonna laugh more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and die a week.
I'm hungry.
The bus went off the wrong way.
Tom has the right to know.
Your wind.
She took a test.
I'll study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you?
I've met him before.
Tom didn't give up.
Tom didn't panic.
I made a few mistakes on the test.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to get him out of here.
Can I do something to help Tom?
You took off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already grown a man.
Let's not lie.
I fixed it.
It's not an art, it's a toothwash.
I didn't see you either.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so excited.
Did you hear about him?
She blew up the blouse right away.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My dad loves to read.
Did you know you were wearing different shoes?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had a single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night and Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna go away.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
The letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better be sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time.
Men enter the shape of a car.
It's not the end of history yet.
Don't be quick.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get a little under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry bag.
Jim's name is James.
Do you have any other hotels you can recommend?
That bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
There's a need for more research.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in France?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anna's a little girl.
Just press your fingers.
I went to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived in ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't like ammo.
You're my best friend.
I organized a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
It was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five inputs.
I just want to move with you.
She became twenty and one.
I heard that coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They're coming from Sweden.
Watch out when you're crossing a busy street!
A man has to work.
That's exciting.
What's your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's in touch.
They're wasting their city life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It's been between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom buried Mary.
I think Tom's moved too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat dry.
Throw those bitches out if you love them.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was taken from the panic.
Can I open a condom?
He was a baseballist.
Don't say such things.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The article's completely occupied.
I'm cheering you for a ride.
I'll check on the upstairs floor.
Tom's on his way to the first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this if you love it?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you handle this?
I think you get so much.
You told me that again.
It's been six years since I started studying English.
I can't buy you that dress.
I'm working like a chicken.
Brian made Kate wait.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate that?
Tom doesn't understand anything from French.
It's the same hospital that Tom works for.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate is eating a lot of rain.
Don't connect to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be abolished.
The good God made a man first, then made a woman, and then He felt sorry for the man, and gave him a token.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't raise any noise.
Don't look them in your eyes.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Oh, he's dancing.
Today, cars can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please, start now.
I've seen your driver's book.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from placebo.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human folly is endless," I say, and because of this self-criticalness, I think it's an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
The unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole show goes upstairs.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I want things to be the same again as they were.
Show me.
Tom got his teeth removed last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't hide how you feel about that.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom is often sick.
The key's not in the key.
What's the minimum payment in Italy?
Tom re-enters the lamp.
That's my car.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very mad.
Our teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have dinner together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out Tom's fault.
She's wearing a pulver.
Sometimes my money's over.
Don't worry, Mr. President, with so many bad weddings, she's hardly even IMA teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a quiet little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself, leaping from a rock.
Where are you born?
These clothes are all right.
They went straight to their destination.
The boy went through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The account, please.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Have you finished dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his uncle's bicycle.
Do what you think is right.
Don't you love Tom?
The state pays off.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by foreign intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it's been a mistake.
My father's going to the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a prayer.
Don't push me, I think.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another alcoholic?
A lot of people share my view on the matter.
The blue one's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big start at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be executed, but a fire to be burned.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Prefer the words on an abbreviated order.
Tom can speak French much colder than I do.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was on his way.
I brought the girl in between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, and I can't speak German.
I have no insurance.
He ended up with Jael in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
From milk we make cheese and milk.
How many episodes have you seen on One Piece?
I didn't mean it seriously.
I'm a vacation this week.
If a sick woman wears thousands of paper jars, her desire is to be healed.
I'm surprised that the building is still standing.
I'm not oweable to you at all!
The bus driver didn't see a walker.
Why did you leave?
I want my rice back.
I've been through my vacation in Hacone.
Look at those documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They're drinking tea in the hall.
Tom burned the engine.
What the hell is going on with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Get 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that what's happening to you?
Among other things, did you finally hear from him?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Watch out.
How did I get to the airport?
Who pulled it out?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're the guys.
Bad time prevents us from leaving.
Now he's learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm scared.
How did you learn to speak French?
Stay there tonight.
You've come into a vicious series.
I can't worry about that.
The spread of television has been a significant waste of our time reading.
I'll need all the time to explain everything.
Don't put me in a cell.
The new corona virus is very infected.
Every time I look for you, you don't.
You're coming down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm not officially here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here until 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a broken filip.
I need to fix this.
I'm ready for breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She's looking at me in a very significant way.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want you to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people are able to walk well, while others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and look at me.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Shut up your teachers.
I heard someone came in.
Tom went on his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan has a lot of excellent drawings.
Do you believe there is a god?
I'm hanging out with the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses were burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it on your own.
He was sentenced to death.
I've been waiting for five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house is burning.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How heavy is your daughter?
Tom shouldn't have done this.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borch" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knees have been lowered.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over forty years old.
Are you wearing the driver's book?
I don't need your help.
He's in front of the door.
My business is getting worse again.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid I can't speak for a promotion right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you scared?
I haven't talked to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you light the light?
He's drinking a lot of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You've broken your shoes in the back.
We just got information from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm learning French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's the matter, actually?
Take care of Tom.

Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it just as you told me to.
Who are you living on?
Tom was in my bus.
I've been waiting for a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much as the disease took him, as the hater.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
Allah is the Great, the Great.
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the film, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog's watching TV too.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not wrong.
He's watching television sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
They're only leaving 30 minutes before the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I died.
I hope we'll hear it soon.
Our journey here was a mistake.
Don't touch us so much.
Hobbies are to collect postal marks.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.
That's why Tom won't understand anything.
Don't forget to bring kitchen benefits like knifes and cooking courts.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised never to do it again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you'll like it.

I think you're panicked.

You're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My vacation plans were broken.
I haven't seen you in a few days.

Where's the toilet?
I need to report this.
That's enough of you with French, isn't it?
He left the holiday.
Mary said Tom was her cousin.
They got five perverts.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Get the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
I saw his father driving.
Keep your room clean and clean.
I had a hard night.
She didn't like her husband.
I've been studying his face for pleasure.
Music is mankind's common language.
Give me some sugar.
I'll get you.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It'll be a pleasure to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom is very interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
This is Copacaban!
Maybe it's true, but I don't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Look how I do it.
We're going to the movies, come with us.
He's often going to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was over.
I'll be with you if you go and do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston that you lived in last year?
That's a complex problem.
It's 10:00 now.
It's like a rope.

I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't make Tom understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I haven't seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle if you love it.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest medical advice is remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I'm not interested in doing this.
Tom thinks it's gonna work.
Can you speak French?
They described it as lost.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count the bags?
You have to find a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
There's a lot of students living in that little village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't.
You're a good singer.
The cat's eating.
I'm used to my parents not to pay me attention.
When we're talking about travel, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.

I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks like a young man shy.
It's made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I've had a lot of sleep.
Be more accurate.
I was a vacation.
No one's gonna understand.
Tom went out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a rice.
Tom wasn't wearing a knee.
You think you're fun?
That's how you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy hits all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied it to the table.
I'm young.
The city is big.
He promises me he won't tell anyone.
Are you already in charge?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom's being tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
Drink water.
Don't worry.
Tom's not good at last.
First, I have to tell you something.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we lie before the family first and after the name.
Give it to him.
The boy's pale reminds his father of an outsider.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked right in my eyes.
Don't stop for me.
How do you distinguish them?
It's time for us.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't touch them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can I say that a man has problems with alcohol?
Is there anyone on the garage to meet me?
I haven't heard him in a few months.
I don't play both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
That's something I understand.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the man who gave me this car.
We're not going to fire under the pressure of the tyrant.
Tom's full of memories.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so mad.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you overstep that?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone except me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have any subordinates who speak French?

He's been fishing all day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers in the bus were fifty.
Tom's working in the vineyard.
Tom had nothing to do.
Who's Tom listening to?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want attention.
I love it.
Please wake me up at 6:00 in the morning.
I feel uncomfortable with her.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The staphides are torn out of a rough skin.
I was in India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We did it when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of a terrible song made him break up.
Do you have this rice in the black?
It wasn't a holiday.
Emma ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg speaks too much.
I've dropped a lot of things.

This powder costs more than $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their name.
That's for Tom.
This is the place Tom was born.
My car's in service.
I have an old car.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Open your fingers before they're stuck.
I'll be there.
Don't get too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment would bring him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them out, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's friend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
This book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I went to Magistral 58.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Cut off your blouse, please.
I'll just forget about it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary got serious.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I have nothing.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get a little foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We were on a trip to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You're drinking from my watch.
It was more cheap than I thought.
How's the job going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone's a favor.
Are you selling French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll leave tomorrow .
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to learn French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I've barely dealt with the candles.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But there's no baby, Turkish panties, we're going to Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom intends to write.
The condition of the injured improves.
We have a lot of big Lotus lists.
We are firmly convinced that when he makes statements, the author must avoid subscribing to the valuable habits, which are used in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are, in fact, absolutely excessive in the light of the purpose.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Murder yourself," make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
It hits me every time I saw blood.
Don't!
I thought we were gonna make it till 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't go through the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep while I read a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't so strong.
I'm not a king.
They've made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilograms of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to your house?
Jane's filled out an application.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The idiots run where the angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been busy with sports all my life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you mind if I come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've waited so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm so happy.
You don't have to say such things when there's kids around.
He makes it easy.
I want to improve my French production.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today's the train's late for ten minutes.
It's been quiet.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do it?
She didn't like him.
You're learning French, aren't you?
I have to go to a meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing on the weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The check is not open.
Try to calm down.
We need to do an inquiry on the date of the test.
Maybe he'd run away from us.
Everyone's dying.
Tom's a monster.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, virtually every family has a parlour.
I'll be in Boston next week.
Garvan's flying away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly are you doing, what's the scope of the study, your main interest?
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I was going to say hello to Tom.
I think Tom May is drunk.
I've had a lot of headaches.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's a little chance I can't come to the meeting.
She always greeted me with a gift.
How do I know?
Aren't you going?
I think you should see this.
He can read very well.
Tom's okay, isn't he?
She's looking short in the paper.
J.F. Kennedy's buried in the graveyard in Arlington.
I don't give up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos broke the mountain.
He added some sugar in the coffee.
Give me your rice.
I don't take any medications.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to plant his audience.
He'll get to the Hackodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to try.
Hello!
They're eating apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I'm finally very disappointed. My favorite football team is the West.
I made it easy for him to relate to the sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I've learned French for three years with a language carrier.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until the light is clear.
Tom's hurt.
It's his stomach.
They give them part of their free time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
I'll stay for three more days.
We left the trip tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I've had a lot of things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John were here, I wouldn't have been forced to come.
You better wear a sweater under your hat.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laugh.
I completely removed it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum.
He insisted on it, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom swims very fast.
Please add this site to the Prepaid.
I've got a lot to say on this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what matters to you.
The worst thing is it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were futile and the man died soon.
I noticed you weren't there last night.
Grieze threatened us.
You want to buy this half.
He's a great brain surgeon.
Last month, I was out.
He can speak French too.
Are you leaving?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They hired the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I go now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been living in France for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You're learning French, aren't you?
The girl used to play only.
Play in a group.
The birds drank.
Tom's done the job at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he's late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
That's how you feel.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to discover it.
Did they get to the museum with the bus?
Is he your teacher?
Watch out for him.
Be precise.
What else do you want to read?
There's a golden rule: whoever has the gold, he determines the rules.
The house is surrounded by ghosts.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that's not forever is always old.
You stopped again.
Tom got married when he was 30 years old.
I helped Tom do my homework.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
It's my shot.
Did you hear Tom speaking French?
I've been pretty, haven't I?
You really speak French quite well.
Hi, Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get the basic knowledge of the number.
I finished my philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go?
You can always share in the work of the younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't stop a man from believing in something, even less than yourself.
I don't feel very good.
The climate doesn't work.
You're sitting in my seat.
Don't you want anything to scare you?
They all agree with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want a MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm upset when I think about it.
I paid two dollars for the tax.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I don't have any intention of interrupting that clock for a while, and I'm not telling you to split up with him at all.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna be fine.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be in the next bus.
Mary made eggs sandwiches.
What did you see?
I bought it every morning in the summer.
Shut up your rice.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure at your place.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time for his word.
I prefer grapefruits in front of the portals.
This place deserves to be visited at least once.
He keeps reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister washed her blusa.
I told you another time, didn't I?
Why do you keep repeating that there's too much time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want any gold or silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like a Portuguese juice.
Ever since I took your book, until I left it, I've been through a lot of laughs, and one day I think I'd start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's on the run.
And that's what I saw.
Delphine's kind of a bat.
What color are these?
He searched his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nine flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace can't be maintained with honor, he'll stop being peace.
She's got a room with beautiful furniture.
The cheap calculators can buy at the price of eight cups, and they are needed for thousands of British children in school, not less than flour and rubber.
This is the hospital in which Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
This is my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop fishing.
You can't just go and blame people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not scared.
I'm taking the money back.
She's ready for college.
I think you're really great.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the study time, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's looking around like a chicken without his head.
Greece is an old country.
Several people visited the meeting.
He dressed his coat and left the house.
Tatoeba's new site will use the home "hiper" database of the database "founded by the foundations" search, and will go to the tattoo-OS server with tattoo CPU, made entirely of tattoo.
The old man stopped her.
She hated to call her a coward.
I like it very much.
I've never voted.
Where's the toilet?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I've completely forgotten.
She gave me a good present.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the king.
I don't intend to apologize to Tom.
What are you doing?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What do you recommend me?
I'm sure Tom hasn't even noticed you're late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be quick to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, and Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Could Tom come tomorrow?
Look where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom didn't get used to city life.
Save your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're getting too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
Without a hat?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What's the minimum payment in Luxembourg?
His judgment is predetermined.
Are these candles?
If you have to choose between a drink and a cigarette, what would you choose?
The answer is yes.
I think that's great.
Did he go through the test?
Don't leave the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
That kind of thing is scary.
I think it's better to lie down.
I love you so much.
I called the phone.
The wolves are moving on the gloves.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum's closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't give up.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
That guy's stable.
I didn't make it for a while.
That wasn't my fault.
Did you draw the paper?
I don't care what's going to happen.
I saw you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're coming to this wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for all the others.
Are you sure you want to throw it out?
Tom speaks French.
The situation improved emotionally by what it was.
I played you.
His jacket was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories that you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people have faced.
I've been waiting a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more detail?
Is it wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we should study things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That connection is really good for you.
I think you're gonna be a great father.
There's no way you can connect to him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
This is my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come in nine?
Let's sync the clocks.
I'm selling every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do it.
Is that an empty store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I told you, it's good.
This is the camera Tom made with the photos.
Make sure you don't lose.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man.
We worked well to connect the two ends.
Good morning.
John's dad died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she's not going to freeze, no matter who she's saying.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The respondent was given the right to appeal.
Let's not hurry.
My father went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make quick exits.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
