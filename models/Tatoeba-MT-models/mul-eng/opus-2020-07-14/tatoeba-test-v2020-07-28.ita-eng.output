One of the reasons why Twitter is so popular in Japan is a characteristic of Japanese: Japanese uses the ideology that allows more information in 140 characters than in other languages, without considering Chinese.

They talked all night.
Tom's gone to prison.
He's reading a novel.
There were a lot of people on the street.
You decided to write them.

I'll do what I have to do.
I've never stopped loving Tom.
My father has been dead for three years.
I was to surprise you.
It's too simple.
Why don't you work harder?
How's it going tonight?

You're from Hokkaido, aren't you?
Tom did this for me.
Tom's got three niptos.
Both of the brothers were there.
It wasn't Tom's fault.
Tom is expressing himself in a good English.

I learned so much from you.
Tom sent me some magazines in French.
Tom apologized for everything he did.
We need to help them.
You've got a lot of enemies.
You seem a little nervous.
She also ignores the most basic notions of science.
I suppose it made sense to go ahead and pay the account now.
Have you ever been out with them?
Tom decided to slow down.
It would be terrible.
We have to do our best to change things.
The boy was putting a card bank in the shed.
I didn't need his help.
It touched a hole.
If you want more details about it, you have to ask my boss.
Why does Tom like so much Boston?
Is it okay if we eat out tonight?
I worked with an annual contract.
They just wanted to be left alone.
Who's going to Boston with you?
I see my crown.

Nobody wants to play with her.
Look at that woman!
I don't answer the stupid questions.
We often sing together.
There's a package for Tom on my desk.
What was the result?
I sent him home.
Did you throw all the trucks?
Sami will like Layla's soup.

He's giving you a lot.
Does he love his wife?
Tom's not contributing, is he?
Tom will eat a cheeseburger.
Tom didn't try to resist.
He made a mistake.
State with Tom.
Tom's as high as you are.
He came with me.
I spent a lot of time in Australia.
It's crazy, isn't it?
It wasn't your sister.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
This object is currently exhausted.
Tom's very ignorant.
He won't believe what happened today.
Can I take a picture of him?
I remember your name.
We called our dog White.
He was himself taking Layla.
It's not the length of life, but its depth.
It's so stupid, I swear I don't support it.
We'll take it.
Do you really believe in law?
I know a girl who always smiles.
I would never betray his trust.
Tom understands what I mean, I think.
I'd like Tom to be here with us today.
I don't remember my father's face exactly.
He's washing his car.
Tom's not going to come back now.
You looked at the mirror.
How could he have sex with my wife?
He threw the ball first.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are satisfied.
He is not interested in his English lessons.
I've been having a good night.
Tom doesn't want you to do that.
Tom's rich, but he's not happy.
Take the table out, please.
This is a great dress.
I did what I was asked.
I keep writing to Tom sometimes.
We just have to find him.
Can I see you again?
Let's solve this problem together.
Is this the first time you did this?
Should I give Tom this?
Do you have friends?
I helped him.
She's really pretty.
The rest is history.
Tom is used to stay up all night.
We're not going soon.
We could get caught.
So you have skin on your chest after all.
It's just a minute.
What color were they?
She's a weird guy.
We don't have to talk in the library.
I want my daughters to learn to speak French.
I'm shocked.
I doubt Tom's a celebrity.
I've eaten enough.
Ten rows of rows have been lost since their series of victories has been over.
I'll take care of you.
Sami's talking a little bit about Arabic, but he doesn't know how to read it.
Tom never gets anything for Christmas.
Tom was always critical.
I'm holding your finger.
Where'd you get that?
You didn't have to break up.
All the days of my money.
You're still all prime weapons!
I won't bother you anymore.
This box contains meles.
Can Tom do it for us?
If there's time, let's go shopping.
He's back home now?
I thought I'd go with her.
Hey, guys, I think I found something.
I had no idea you were so stupid.
I can't trust you.
Tom seems angry.
What course is recommended?
The long journey increased its popularity.
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
He did what he was told.
Tom gave Mary a banana.
Is it legal?
You don't know I'm Japanese.
We're really having fun.
We should let her rest.
It's not a long way to go.
I know you don't know him.
For pleasure, bring us two cup of coffee.
I still have friends in Boston.
Were you jealous of them?
I'm sure Tom's not Canadian.
I want to be safe.
Oh, my God.
Can you speak in waiting?
I'll see you next Friday.
In modern computer systems, the umlaut and the rest are represented in the same way.
I don't believe in some kind of story.
What exactly is Tom referring to?
The bird flys.
May I call her tomorrow?
Abata to Kyoto.
He was close to Tom.
He hates the Curry.
Write in Arabic.
We're divorced.
I was helped by my father to paint the kitchen.
Tom's reasonable.
See the video.

You won't listen to a word of what I'm saying.
This is one of Tom's forces.
There's too many people here.
Is it over and over?
Chiami Tom.
Tom doesn't even like driving.
I spent my vacation in Tunisia.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
He'd be in Australia.
That word describes it perfectly.
Do you like my cake?
I'm not invincible.
You don't like anyone.
Just tell them not to worry.
I'd love to see Tom.
That house needs repairs.
I didn't get this fight.
He's deaf and he's moving, and he's becoming a blind man.
I still have to finish my tasks.
Tom didn't want coffee.
He won't believe us.
Don't try to scare me.
I'm proud of you.
Tom can't get Mary out of his head yet.
I can cook.
I play basketball with them.
I was from the barbie.
Speak slowly, please!
Tom has long hair.
Don't relax too much about it.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Did you know that Tom and Mary are good at golf?
Who is she to decide?
Why don't the police stop Tom?
He's pulling her off.
It's still in the kitchen, right?
You can't talk to my girl.
At least she's not fixing her breast.
Let me tell you why I don't like Tom.
How did you get in?
I've been fooled at the exam because I didn't study.
He was ready.
We need to find Tom before he gets old.
Don't wait for pie.
John told you the truth.
I don't think it's gonna happen.
We'll miss your smile.
If the time allows, we leave in an hour.
I'm not as lucky as you.
Tom and Mary asked for the best working conditions.
It's important for you to keep this secret.
We should start looking for Christmas gifts for children.
She refused to pay.
Tom called his dog Cookie.
Let me explain.
Tom decided to buy a house.
I'm too young to drive a car.
He's stronger than me.
I'm the last one you've seen.
He's watching her.
That man is a soldier.
I thought Tom was guilty.
I called that song so much that I could do it while I was asleep.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
I can't stop laughing.
South Africa became independent in 1961.
I think Tom's eating right now.
I could've done better.
I have some books in English.
Can you make him smile?
Tom can go if he wants to.
I want to work with you.
I like to wear sports clothes.
Why were you so short?
Tom and Mary were on their way out.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate Queen Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.
I'm so proud of them.
Who's he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Tom, who's living with you?
What's the problem, dear?
I don't want them to get angry.
Is Tom really sick?
He didn't wash his hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
He goes to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's nipote?
I believe you.
She was having fun with her son's bastard.
I said it was good.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
And the kids are already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the way out of the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Give me a kiss, boys.
I like your painting.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at Hyogo University.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life was going on without problems.
Nobody wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
There's a lot of squalls from these parts?
Tomorrow, if God will, we will be with your parents.
It's from Sweden.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
Do you really believe us?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like the fish with the liquids.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born on October 28th.
It's a beautiful photograph.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humbled them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom's working what?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to them?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't hurt my heart.
You didn't pay for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic!
She was pianist.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We're having fun.
He's down.
I read books often.
Tom and I want to talk about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm old.
I've got the Pork's widow.
Good night, my friend.
I bought a book in English in a library.
Tomorrow I go to the library to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us some interesting stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite history movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
All of us.
The giant pandas live only in China.
I'm coming after you.
Don't say something like that.
It's so bad!
Jim's Canadian.
You've done well here.
Where have all the others gone?
I'm relaxed.
The animal was riding in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for a appointment.
Tom's still absent.
I ate all the honey.

Is the park open today?
We're only preparing ugarine food.
We'll go to Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
She's gonna stop crying.
I know her.
And the real ones were us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately my complement is only once a year.
Put it through your bike.
I meant it like a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt pirate.
I can go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think she told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to me!
It's good in this game, isn't it?
Take care of them.
Help in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't look so surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's unbelievable, isn't he?
Does this have a purpose to protect you from the squash?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I'd like you to call me.
Don't you want to use it?

I'm faithful.
To write in Braille?
I don't know what he's got.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate a mela.
I caught him.
He's adopted the orphanage.
I think they're talking French.
Make a step forward.
You have to become more active.
Tom and Mary are kidding?
He's a smoker.
I don't have an alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will this summer do?
He's getting angry.
Can you speak Shanghaine?
He's restricted because I washed him.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom asks what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?

I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed its theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass the ketchup, please.
It's happened that I sat with you at a convention.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom presented himself soon for the lesson.
He's a little surprised, isn't he?
Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I've decided not to repeat it.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
Sleep in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his drinks.
Search harder on Google!
It's not your only problem.
You're talking like you were the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to grow.
Do you have any instruments?
Their dying?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Take the gun.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.

You're good.
How would he want to change her?
It's a nice day.

I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love to be right.

I didn't grow up like that.
He can park here.
Please tell him to get out of here.
Tom's just getting dressed.
I love it almost every day.
I'm not going to apologize.
We really like it very much and small.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a warm summer night.
I'm always going to bed.
It's decisive.
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He searched the keys of the car in his bag.
I really don't want to talk.
So it's got to be silver.
I really like my work.
I'll suggest you be more cautious.
It's gone.
He should've done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help.
He'll be out in the afternoon.
It's getting dark.
We'll meet in a day.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you picture when you look at that picture?
How many are the world's continents?

How can you never say anything?
Scandalos!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep the language simple.
