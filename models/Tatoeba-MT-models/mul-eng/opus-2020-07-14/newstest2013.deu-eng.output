A Republican strategy to combat the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight elections.
However, the Brennan Center lasts for a myth by confirming that the polling rate in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
In 10 years, the Republicans' attorneys have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One is sure that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of the elections.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US federal states are responsible for implementing the elections in individual countries.
In this regard, the majority of American governments have announced new laws requiring registration or entry into force since 2009.
These phenomena have gained significance after the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives could be listed in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative provisions were introduced only in 2011, which restrict the exercise of the right of choice in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the elector to present a light display and a sign of the U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time limits for the preliminary vote, declare the right to be registered as voters on the election day, and reject the right of citizens to vote for a legislative act.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state has requested the voters to provide a flash display.
Indiana was the first state of the state to meet such a demand.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities decided to issue this practice to other countries.
During the last two years, they have encouraged them to present a light display in 34 federal states, where voters are forced to do so.
It is important to note that the US citizens do not have a universal visa card, such as the health insurance card, in contrast to Quebec.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, which means 21 million eligible persons, do not have any evidence of their state's state-of-the-art lighting by a government authority.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an indication.
However, there is often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to receive the required statement.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low income are being severely affected.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years are not above the required lighting display.
That's still enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who raise their voices for democratic candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their flashlights issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same Member States allow members of Angel or Jäddwein, who choose to use the Republican side more strongly, to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state of the state has asked for evidence from the civil society for elections.
Arizona was the first state to submit such a request.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is on hand that two of three Spanish voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators were promoted in eight federal laws, with which the registration of voters was completed on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide personal assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the electoral registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections have contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
As the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the 2010 New Elections Registration by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other federal states aimed at shortening the time for the preliminary vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters selected in advance were African Americans, although only 13% were elected by the federal state.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
Last only 11% of the voters made up, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites represented 76% of the voters were only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their allies have opposed the energy of the adoption of laws which restrict the registration of voters.
Several legislative proposals were blocked by the Vetos of the democratic Governor.
The U.S. Attorney General has taken action to enforce the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal laws have been adopted, which require the prevention of a lighting display.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt undermine the exercise of the right of choice.
The democratic critics ridicule the political nature of the laws adopted and see in them, as a clear objective, the impact of the results in the countries that are excluded for 2012.
A 2011 report by Brennan Centers shows that the countries that have adopted these laws draw 171 out of 270 votes that are required in the electoral framework to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the rules of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of the elections.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatic pre-recognition: should the test be made or not?
In fact, the PSA test has sometimes miscellaneous results, with false negative or even negative positive results leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to stronger delays in the conduct of early detection tests by the already unclosed men.
Whether or not to show the status bar
We have heard the opinion of two experts.
In the studies carried out in the United States, there were many barriers between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without prior recognition.
This study has also shown that after 12 years the probability of metastases education is 30 to 40% higher if no early diagnosis has been performed.
That is why I recommend testing from a 50-year-old or 40-year-old when you have a direct relationship that has already been affected by prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men in African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer disease has been identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in a long term, and in these cases it is decided to continue to monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not have treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their life.
They are given an active monitoring and are offered treatment when disease progresses.
The criteria for a decision which should be addressed and who should not be addressed are more precisely defined.
That is why I still recommend that the test be carried out.
But most importantly, it is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In cooperation with the international association for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian cancer company.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by pollution.
Several remain completely unclear.
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for the Canadian cancer company, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million in Quebec today," laments the speaker André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after viewing the cigarette, the risk of death from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer company, obesity and adipositas also promote the spread of disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, breast-feeding, breast-feeding, breast-feeding, breast-feeding, breast-feeding and breast-feeding.
"The research shows that regular physical activity is protecting the entire life of anti-grab cancer," he adds.
The Food
The organisation also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
To a large extent, it increases the risk of getting sick at a gravel or stomach cancer.
Wrestlings should also be mixed.
The preservation of meat by washing, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Later can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancers.
However, your studies are not currently closed.
After the Canadian cancer company, the studies on vitamin E are controversial.
While a study revealed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another increased.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his thoughts and family responsibilities.
"The implementation of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has raised a certain view in the last summer, and that is good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is predicted that the last part, its existence from the standard model - our best or "the least false" statement of nature and the behaviour of matter - is expected but not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicist it's still not absolutely sure that it's really about the higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is very similar to the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be fully secure about it.
Nevertheless, let us see that it is really about the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of hiding, and we look at what's going on.
In this world, there is a strict law that makes it impossible for two objects to be at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to ignore this rule - and do not try it too hard because you are getting tired.
Because even if participation physics is really a rare world, it appears that it also applies to such a law: the Paulic principle of exclusion, which states that two parts cannot possess the same room at the same time if they are in the same "quantity", in which this "state" exists in some of its characteristics.
From this, the physicists divide the parts into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and listen to Pauli's principle.
And in the other, the bosses, a common band of anarchists, who are not holy, are not, in any case, of this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosones, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laborers (the rest are absolutely amazing) are in two groups: the moons that we will not treat here and the "force parts" by which the great forces of nature spread and which the Higgs-boson would be connected anywhere.
But it has to be emphasized here that these bosones are not all exotic creatures like you could think of.
If you are able to read this chronic, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "bote" of the electromagnetic force.
If a part with an electric charge is speeded up or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field is "damaged" right in this place, in about like a steel stone that has been carved into a roof.
This "distortion" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrarot or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosses "power carrier".
Stabilizes Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "damaged" in order to show this Boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the ruler must achieve very high energy, a little comparable to a frozen roof, whose surface could only be demanded by a very large stone.
That is why a large part accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a line with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in clarifying the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all parts and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't -- for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator itself.
And similarly, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as well as the photon) do not have a mass.
What can all these research be "good" now, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to examine the standard model (SM), and they also enable the physicists to examine all differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are many other physicists who hope to find such differences, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the last major weaknesses exist, since there is no explanation for the force (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the material of the universe (again ups!).
However, no such differences have been found in the CERN so far.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it does not exist.
Others: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of Laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would solve such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the lost Physiker Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was found in the 1960s, and in 1962 he himself developed the first permanent striper (who were the first punched) - has already said that the laser was considered more than a "labor game" at the beginning.
Do you think...
In addition, applications can also be made from all the instruments that carry out research.
For example, Willard Boyle has again developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will gradually change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With her Committee on "Death in Würde", Quebec recently discussed the serious question of life.
The debate must be resumed in a short time, although a legislative proposal is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devor tried to consider this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that struck him had left him for a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've spent seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in his home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he came in the morning.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an inexhaustible weakness prevents her from going to the toilet alone and even eating herself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he wishes to re-design himself to help with food.
It helps him even to relax and talk to the neighbors who are working for him, bring his medications to him, and offer him a bath.
The Must of Normal Death.
"My greatest wish is that you will complete my case, because this is misleading," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this practice.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man panics in the rock," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unhindered demolition for some people.
"This depends on the ability of the person," he says, adding a step back.
Because in the eyes of several people working in the Palliative care, great events take place in the midst of this retreat.
The patients who are assigned to the home for palliative care of Victor Gadbois suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will be replaced by doctors and nurses who care for them, no longer with the so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by retiring".
But because of the disease, I really knew my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want any more in life," she says, before she accepts that you set up a mask that helps you to breathe.
Nevertheless, she looks forward to another last visit of her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois, you are offering a group of voluntary body care and assistance during the meal.
The palliative approach will then be used if there are no other possibilities.
To make the death pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants have a bed for palliative care.
It's very small if you take into account that one day we're all going to die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It is granted to the dying person if he wishes to have a mouth bottle with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of every day.
Last night we served a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will cut off the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"We help members and patients alike," reports care director Nathalie Savard.
There's no day like the other day in Victor's house.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his bosses, while being attacked by his honours, a 36-year-old man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children dies tragically after he tried everything to survive.
"For six months three to five beds are always with cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients assigned to home Victor-Gadbois come from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that will reduce the suffering of patients if they have reached the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the community for domestic palliative care in the Montreal Grand Chamber, specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
That is exactly what this great delay in the health care of Quebecs ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are opposed to the adoption of a law on the provision of death assistance and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifest has been signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to investigate their opposition to such an initiative.
As a result, Dr. Christiane Martel is not effective enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting death assistance.
Before long, she says, I saw a patient who had 14 days of great pain in the emergency without taking steps to relieve her suffering.
I was afraid that the patients would only die because they did not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she broke down a serious chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to discontinue treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I had stopped fighting, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
Not a launchable item
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have prayed to die thanks to the care staff that this desire has not been replaced after their pain has been reduced by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be said clearly that palliative care in the treatment of pain is not ovarian.
According to Elsie Monereau, the leader of the palliative care of the community of domestic palliative care in Montreal, 8% of patients do not talk to pain treatment.
Therefore, at the end of life, doctors often return to the terminal seduction, which is beyond the patient’s ability to communicate with either sporadic or lasting until the time of his death.
We can't do it as long as we don't take this side of suffering.
Patients without pain reduction will often have the opportunity to return to this terminal setting.
Patients whose pain is not reduced say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean "I want you to touch me," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate canals large size in Quebec
Officials of the road construction agency, companies of the construction company, money managers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia are telling each day what they know about a great "system", which is restricted to the construction industry, employees, politicians, trade unions and Mafioso.
A "industrial" which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebecs, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's remarkable how the system feels since a drastic action has been taken," said Jacques Duchesneau, deputy director in Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
The scandal was discovered by him because of an in-depth investigation of the vettings in relation to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only voluntarily approved.
The Duchessnew report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and recruitment of officials.
"From the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have distributed a billion dollars to the contracts," because some added their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to justice", he adds, in the hope that it will "show the tactics behind the individual".
A 2011 life-threatening, permanent anti-corruption unit
In 2011 the permanent anti-corruption unit, which is alive, is also making great efforts with its troops to examine the economy, the media and the government's analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Group", which has caused since 2009 that Montreal's "canalization card" is preceded by the artificial termination of the contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has carried out specific house searches and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal commanders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a city.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just returned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of taking bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The other engineers of Montreal's road construction agency, as well as Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
Finally, the Commission has taken a view by explaining the functioning of the "system" for the acquisition of public contracts.
For several years, he himself had paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator with Mafia, who entrusted the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially those who were then in power.
He was also able to organize an illegal media initiative for former liberal vice-president Nathalia Normandeau.
Channelage contracts whose costs have been artificially borne by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was free of charge.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and Eishockey games, as well as fixing fees of $736.000 as compensation for channelling contracts, which he artificially incurred.
Other officials of the road construction agency have indicated that they were dropping themselves by putting up the calculations with false additional benefits artificially 30-40%.
In addition, a member of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay, accused him of deliberately taking over a shadow money that filled his pockets with black money.
As a result of these allegations, Mr Tremblay returned in early November, which destroyed Montreal in a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to kill the alarm.
As mayor of the city area of Rivière-des-Praiies, on the east of the island, they argued against the sale of a Community-based item for 5 million dollars and for 1.6 million for construction workers in the tree-based real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaign
The study, which will be carried out at the end, says that it is "a fad which enables us to understand the functioning of the Ames' underground system to stop the strike and to initiate the charges."
She says that the procedure "is painful, but positive."
We, however, need only a specific detection unit for Montreal, as well as a surveillance to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "the officers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but above all, think about the role of the "mandators who are in the art" if they were not developed in the picture!
Out of a share of 70% black money in the financing of the electoral campaign in Quebec, he said: "We have been told that this is just a weak waste of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the costs to parties at $100, which would have nothing to do with the situation: "As long as electoral expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in the process of policy."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by walking the things with courage on the ground, we can build the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international view of Quebec and those of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau asks those who laugh about it to take a look at their own hotel...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal view, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
Everything's going very fast in football.
But I don't get into trouble.
Since my beginning in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairfontaine until my time of play at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
So they use the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The latest events of this summer are common to exhibit very high levels of games.
They also know that each training unit is unique.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the stars and wants to give his best.
On the other hand, I have a lot about Carlo Ancelotti in my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played at the same position as I did.
Ancelotti is the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all techniques.
In Ligue 1 there is no comparable person at present, and he belongs to the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a lot of experience and has won many titles with what he has seen.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January I conducted an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just received a series of injuries.
The confidence he put in me is also a statement for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the captain.
But we win in the meantime.
One of our most important goals is the League Championships: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the end-of-life.
What is the objective of the Union in this competition?
We'll try as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak against very good European men and women.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto so that we can extract the back of the end of the game as a home game.
Can the PSG be a major European Union in short term?
He's already got the budget for this...
In order to become a great European union, Paris has to win title and make a name for a long time.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financially responsible for adopting specific forms of this project.
Would it be a great mistake not to win the title in League 1 as this was in the last season of the case?
Of course, this would be a great surprise.
This year is truly ours to take this title away.
We were close in the last season.
In May we were disappointed that we were strong enough to win.
We've finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
You should normally be with 79 points masters...
But another man, who is from Montpellier, has achieved a better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the great men like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux call for the title, I think we have the witness to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us is expected.
We accept it perfectly.
If, however, we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and we still find something that we can challenge, that's certainly frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A man builds himself up with time.
In the League champions, we have shown strength.
Consider Manchester City, a combination of two seasons has not been able to qualify for the end-of-the-art, and has also carried out considerable expenditure!
In view of the invested sums, you believed in the game break with 15 points forward!
It was thought that our opponents and the French Mastership would be left out of control.
Lyon and Marceille, who were not good in the last season, were "boiled" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the shining winner and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To make it better to speak of a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many towers.
That's why he came and proved he's the star of League 1.
Around there, where he played, he pointed out that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the man we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he read is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French National Mission?
Like a surprise.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
I'm sorry to have stopped my injury for a while.
I've seen things that I've learned from.
Today, I am encouraged to make good games in the National Mission.
This has been my baptism with the "bloos" my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lessons, and today we must be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to the players and right to win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the blue to Brazil.
Is this a game of action in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used it for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never had a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the participants.
Moreover, as often as in these technologies, there is a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, created by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but in dollars, Euro, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange of BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been detected.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a contribution or as a means of payment.
After reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's course fell five months later on $2, before he received today about $10 (the courses are posted on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown its interest in this in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to appear in a video game that can be won or bought by games (and sometimes even switch back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network notes are simultaneously stored in the account book, examiners, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
By contrast, the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymousity.
A number of data relating to this transaction shall be signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can test the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the processed Bitcoins are available in the account book of public accounts distributed across the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task started on computers where the winner, who is a kind of leading central banker, has the privilege of adding these additional lines.
It is about separating the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number before the whole "reopened".
The goal is to find those numbers that produce a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can be found without delay to check if it is correct.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) to pay it twice, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unlinked, since both different fingerprints exist.
The computer that has solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be regularly half-wayd, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins that are currently available are therefore limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred million, which allows a certain playing area...
In addition, the burden of the task will be increased with any improvement in accounting.
The life of the network has already been high and deep.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin installations were stolen.
"The used weakness does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced the paymium, which is a company for real money payments and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, Bar money also reflects this weakness.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse this kind of money.
Others like the blog platform WordPress will accept it.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the account book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been replaced," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, who converted Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this money, believes the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment with a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented in the hands of dealers, and later no new terminals or computer programs need to be installed.
They just have to specify a address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to be covered by the hierarchy's systems which are preferable to the higher horizontally-adjusted systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin passes, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends to reassess the various risks that are considered today as high in the event of the success of this currency.
We're taken from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapas and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain its territory and the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we're killed by our 88 soldiers, as well as those who are injured and injured.
The Taliban are from foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to protect their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have been linked to Dschyhadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek and Tadsiks.
Tolerant, sometimes supported by local authorities, will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with mandel trees, financed by French credits, was done properly.
Kabul has reached the overflewed truck and panzer train without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flows of Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their inconsistencies between 1994 and 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was taken over by war because of the wars of the various rebel groups.
Your take-up was then considered a sort of release and return to safety.
The Afghan women paid the price for the oscurrantism of farmers overrun by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mudschaeddin, Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a position of subordination.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have come back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmakers by arguing that the government's basics are to sell them as a construction country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive US surrender of subcontracts.
They called themselves, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that doesn't come together from the devil.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could benefit from the American applications: capital flow is considerable.
The young people have set up the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have contacted the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the oscurity of the single parties or to corruption of certain driving forces will have to make jobs available.
All, including the armed parties, are equipped with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is everywhere affected.
There's an army now.
Are the authorities under which they are required to be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet war are already trying to rebuild the militias in the province, which will be removed from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a certain decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by withdrawing the office of the Prime Minister, which had been the Constitution since 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong presidency.
President Karzaï wants no foreign controls, in particular the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid for the past 50 years and has long been dependent on foreign aid.
Industry has not been rebuilt, functional vacuum cleaners are not available and important water systems have not been repaired.
Everything will be imported; except for fruit and vegetables will not be produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that has been set up for 30 years in the war, it would be necessary to control infrastructures.
The threat was spread that Afghanistan was defeated immeasurably on the ground.
This also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only present in order to empower them.
Without energy to process the iron or copper in front of the site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountain, no mountain construction is possible.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's copper farm, allow the international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) to make their exorcism and remain the main workers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was concluded on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and young people, the French Institute of Universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cicic) has been established in 2012 to carry out numerous joint work and measures to clean agriculture in thousands of mountain areas and allow it to be carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "wine and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of the cohesion of aid and offensive actions.
These works, which were necessary for the many local labour forces, have been able to contribute to stressing the resistance: vegetation, springs, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural use.
What Souvenir will be left behind for military spending of two billion euros?
A much more detailed budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are often very hard to deal with in this area of more than 2,000 metres.
The message included dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from the municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to free the farmers from the opposition of foreign groups, according to their own statements, their will would be to continue less, better controlled and they would need direct civil aid to their benefits.
A Constitution With the Breakdown in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt was referring to the declaration of constitutionality which gave it temporaryly the unlimited power, more and more of which remained broken, he decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the state capital had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has been based on a provisional, multi-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal transition.
This new initiative has only provided for a stronger column of the country.
For his opponent, the President admires in his "autocratic delirium", by continuing "his word" and "the right of foot".
On the part of his sponsor, it is ensured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that the brothers are forced to ignore their purpose to explain the text section to the Egyptians for a section.
It is also a way for the Presidents to find their public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is going on throughout the country.
Following confirmations in an interview with the American weekly watch Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will probably vote.
Once the people of Egypt are brought back to a unanimous vote, an ultimatum will be placed on the people of Egypt: "You either agree on my draft or I hold the unlimited power", the latter should take a certain end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 Islamic members of this constitutional assembly have adopted the text in a rare atmosphere yesterday.
The majority of liberals have not met the requirement.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they withdrew because they felt that they were not able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach the decision-making capacity, 11 people, represented by staff members, were added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslims.
It is not surprising that the article was adopted unanimously.
On the other hand, the commentators found that the only difference of opinion of the day... was in time for the prayer to be expressed, since some members of the panel felt that the pendulum of the constitutional assembly did not go well.
The text that was adopted last night is composed of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Treaty of 1971 on the Functioning of the European Union states that "the principles of the Scharia are the main sources of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for their other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals who view this as merely a propaganda campaign.
Because they succeed in the Islamicization of the Constitution on other articles.
In this regard, they have in particular Article 220 in the eyes of the University of Al-Azhar, which recognises an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Scharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are called to an opinion have not been selected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of theocracy."
The fears of liberals are also confirmed by the fact that the next Rector of this university should be much less appropriate than the present one.
"This is no time to recognize a concrete religious commitment.
We remain in this Constitution within the framework of the civil state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not Ulama, but academics who have been trained in the French system," laments Alexis Bluet, who writes a doctor's work on the Egyptian constitutional strand.
However, he argues that "that in relation to Article 220 there may be a majority, since the terms used are derived from the religious word.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic Court of Justice, Am. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised, as long as civil rights are competent to decide on it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the broad powers he gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of view: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's will, the inspection of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
There will also be no ban on civilian procedures in military corrections, as the Unions have called for the protection of human rights.
Finally, they share their concerns with the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The actual stock of blasphemia will be maintained, and complaints are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression of opinion, in particular for the press.
In addition, there is no article on the protection of women, underpinned by Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to get out of the television last night, demonstrations were planned for this afternoon.
The sponsors of the state capital will be marked on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists await sacred places, the world's Nebel and a sea from the sun
The Promised Land is united in the beauty of Bible truth, modern comfort and an unsurpassed nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Conscious of the holy places
Visit the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who pray in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galillaa is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding feast, the passage to the water, the setting of the sea storm and the fishing.
Even here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most shrines are located in Jerusalem.
Believers here follow either the path of legend or the cross of Jesus Christ (or Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the graveyards on the mountain Golgotha, where the cruising site, the salvation stone and the tomb of Jesus is located.
Here is a Christian view of the Nabel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is at the place where a Christian legend grew up following the tree from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complainants, the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, there are people from different religious backgrounds who wish to be fulfilled.
Make a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret secret secret before enemies, which the great Herod in 25 C.E. built for his family.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 metres above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins with their own strength.
Everyone else brings an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040 meters high is the famous ski area of Hermon, where it has numerous tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you reach there with a shuttle bus.
The shippers have a total length of 45 kilometers.
An old legend led to allegedly pagan gods on the mountaintop.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of this can be visited on just one trip.
However, at least the five most interested of them should be allowed a visit.
The Israeli Museum is once located near the Knessset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or inscriptions from the dead sea found in falsholes in the Jewish deserts, as well as some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works of the printers and expressives coins, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be produced.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which hosts several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the former visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souven areas there.
The income is free, and the funds are basically paid off.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, is one of the most exciting chapters of history.
The most exciting section is the memory of the children who were built to remember the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
All darkness prevails in the presence of the room.
The stars are working.
And the names of the children of Judah and the lands where they die shall be told.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three most important recovery areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and Oceania.
The water temperature is not below 21°C and the air is warm up to 23°C.
The dead sea is even hotter and will be offered over the entire year.
On the other hand, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the most deep sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore does not even make it easy to breathe on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is incredibly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using saltwaters (natural salts) and sanitation as well as for treatment of skin disorders, allergic, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and radiation-sparing nerves.
The Secrets of Age
These secrets are the old city of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaweed, the Egyptians, Syria, Anatolias, and Mesopotamia enjoyed a relationship with each other.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and altachic legends.
Transfers followed Noah built his archives here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life here.
Tourists would like to shine through the simple gases that are named after star signs.
Fortuna should be the legend for all who touch the walls in the gas with their star signs.
In Jaffa, you can contact newly registered couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can cross through the Roman theater and cross over the fortress of the cross.
In Roman times Caesar was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman states, including Pontius Pilate.
Today evening concerts and operas are presented in the carefully restored theater.
List of destinations for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English: approximately 30% of the Israelites speak Russian.
The money in the trip is taken in no euro, but in dollars that can easily be converted into coins (current exchange rate: $1 to 3.8 coins).
In the city you are often on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast road and in Haifa the only U-bah line in the country with six stations that connect the town with the Upper City.
It is precisely a underground railway.
A drive within the city costs 6 bicycles, which is quite inclusive for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, Sabbaths will be held in Israel.
Markets and businesses are closed from Friday to sunset, and public transport is off.
And in the morning, the work week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only more expensive food is served, excluding meat, sea products, fish without shoes and food that includes milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different courts with hammock and rye meat, soup and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pasta, different sauces, frozen balsams from pears and fruit (falfels) and fruits and vegetables.
There are no exciting dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-being cats, which are pleasant and unsatisfied by the streets.
At night you can even see her sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like live places and don't say no to healing.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs 15 dollars a day.
And driving rental costs 15 cycles per day.
The entrance maps for museums are available in the range of 30 tables.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over Israel visited.
Most adventurers and rescuers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousands of Ukrainian tourists arrived in the country of war, corresponding to a 51% increase in 2010 compared to the period of comparison, prior to the withdrawal of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While discussing the benefits of the law on binding languages for migrants, members of parliament and civil law are already dealing with sensitive certificates.
Each year, 13 million guests come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families that remain in the home.
On 1 December, a law shall enter into force, and every migrant must undergo a test that confirms the knowledge of Russian language.
To date, this arrangement applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing economy and in the individual trade.
However, the tests should be carried out by the Federal Migration Authority in the future for all guest workers.
This requires not only the language, but also tests in Russian history and the principles of law.
Language knowledge must be demonstrated for both the acquisition and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
It also excludes persons who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the fall of the UdSSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the testing stations will be under the auspices of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can activate the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was supported by the Heads of State and Federal Migration Authority.
Citizens' law advocates have repeatedly asked the following question: What does it really bring?
What changes do we need to make in terms of language, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
First of all, contrary speakers of the Migration Authority are going to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Authority's representative in Tadskistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
There are problems with migrants without employment, education, language skills and medical attention.
Sebelow is convinced that a future migrant will encounter people with bad intentions without language, who, under the help of help, will stick him into a dark, narrow barack, where he will spend thousands of his months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised one, and when you arrive, you will be involved, take their steps and do not receive the promised reward," says the head of the Danish Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't move, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who want to earn their money in Russia are not only able to control the language of their country but also unable to express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, it is not as much their debt as the usual: only a few Turkmen, Usbekens and Tadchi can also provide a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not yet money to feed the children, because they are tired of buying them appropriate clothing, shoes and shoes.
As teenagers, these children also gain the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's hard without language," they say.
"You feel relieved and inferior."
Citizens' rights emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
The test must only enable migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, the majority of the guest workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"We are welcome" or "Restricted for unauthorized people"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic debts and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A popular registration can be made quickly and only for a thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are most popular and we are not registered, and then there are cases of repression.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just don't throw any costs for fake paper"
Already on the day on which the law was in force, it appeared that the registration documents of migrants could not be restricted only.
Some of the forged certificates proving the completion of the language were already decided by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The missing paper was printed with a common color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not feel this otherwise: any migrants who hoped to save their own tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a worker migrant three thousand rubles.
In addition, the most urgent task is to protect the system from corruption so that the evidence can not be easily purchased, both officials and citizens' lawmakers agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise that they will get time for a language course for the first time.
In addition, new households without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of Interior Ignores the illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons on offences is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs plans a violation of the gun law for private owners.
To this end, the authorities react to the latest events: wounded by shootings at weddings as well as seven deaths during the execution of the Moscow jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to prohibit the trafficking of non- deadly weapons in the public and eliminate the age for the possession of weapons of mass destruction from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the President of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the arms law will be submitted in the short term.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities are willing to fight the problems by "inhibiting the violence".
An open letter was published on the Internet, its author - representatives of various arms associations - were asked by the authorities to refrain from "insolent abuses".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, except for the offender, Vasilij Lesnikow, the Russian BBC service.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons in the course of six months were committed in 2012, while 1,168 thousand Delikte were registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a violation of the law on the private possession of weapons will not cease to serve on the black market.
At the moment, you can find the manufacturers in Moscow every possible weapon for a small amount of money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the offices
The weapons reached several channels in the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells of former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who has been active in the Ministry of Education for ten years and at the General level.
Screenshot of a web page that takes up the arms
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the war in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Kaucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel, illegal weapons will come to steal orders from criminals.
Baranez explains that there are weapons that were stolen from both the police and directly from the prosecution authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that, in some cases, it was used to set fires to prevent the lack of weapons," said the former military officer.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also contributed to the black market.
"Today there are countless private relief factories that do not maintain international competition and therefore break the weapons under hand on the black market, like in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggel.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a private, sometimes hand-made production and a mafia that organizes the smuggel," explains the former military officer.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminal Literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
The excessive share of illegal weapons is caused by the media by the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are there through the "School of the Responsible Officers who have arrived in their work with weapons", says the report.
The researchers' data followed 17% of the weapons from conflict areas, 14% go back to the gun production dumps, and 5% come from illegal explosions.
A salesman of a gun carrier who does not want to be named, ensures that weapons found in illegal burials no longer buy any more because they are old.
As a result, it is more common for the dealer to take care of the backyard in a gunstore.
A weapon, for example a gun of the TT type, is bought over a knife.
The weapon is fired and passed through the teeth.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and therefore, if they can't contain the crime detection plan, periodically purchases of checks by dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales counsel adds.
"Wei and Luxusladen"
Buyers and sellers often find each other the most known.
I had looked at Web pages and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I get to the "Begowja" station, where a person would wait for me who would bring me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I'm getting there first

"To provide a gun, I need a person who has contacts," says the sales counsel. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there is a need to get in there and break up with a code like "by Ivan Ivanowitsch, who makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I'm even going to some damage about a person I trust.
He's also giving me the damage because he knows I don't hurt him.
Neinings are looking for guns on different roads.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of 1990 as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this subject.
As a result, the schematics have not changed.
He made a photo album in which he was depicted as "all possible."
"I felt like I was in luxury," the military officer recalls.
The buyer does not get the cat in the bag according to Baranez, but can try everything.
I, as a potential customer, not just buy it, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target ship.
"Then I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we're dealing with each other," the expert explains.
Buying out of sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There will be no need for any papers or personal meetings.
"They need only the appropriate sum of money," it says in the advertising article on the website "Buy guns or guns".
There give users your orders and ask questions.
Will it also be sold to minors?
"Of course without license," asks the user "Iwan".
"Buy a TT. Moskau", asks the Laconian question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently closed countless web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service now.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in Siberia and can light coal
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible shall take the orders.
The buyer passes the money over a bank account.
"As an answer he gets a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the joint organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can also go out empty and go behind the gates if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently closed countless web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service now.
"People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labor camp and can cook coal," he says.
A make-up for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal weapons, experts are expected to calculate prices of 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun from the type Makarow for $100 to 300.
You have to wait until one half months.
The weapons will be distributed in military camps by observers in the middle of the range.
The official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs followed up the number of dealers with illegal weapons throughout Russia from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and repression in relation to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, hard-food and supermarket employees
Every fourth American youth is sitting right behind the box of McDonald's
In the past days, there have been massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still no one can predict whether the protests will be further shaken or if the air will soon go away.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-hand joint organisations.
In addition to increasing the number of wages paid by simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, the organizers of the protests follow the objective of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised commercially.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after thanks, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales in the United States attacked millions of customers, leading both to trade.
On that day, some Walmart workers, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put their work down and extended their work together with trade unions and left-wing active branches of the chains whose target group is low and middle-income.
Walmart sells all the products, from winds over yachts and car batteries to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart films is between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the less paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics follow that Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheap because the employees are paid badly.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing gables or hand scanners.
The participants of the protest at Black Friday demanded increases in wages and expressed their concern that the contribution to the operating health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker, who worth $9.5 per hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers at the California University in Berkeley reported that if the company increased the average wage by 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're paying for.
If Walmart would fully reimburse the loans to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cent more in the future.
Each year, this would be compared to today's monthly expenditure of just $12.39.
For the sake of Walmart, it is satisfied that only in nine German states there have come to protest and these have not protected the company from any loss.
The Black Friday spent the next day in his shop from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight, and Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second during this period.
Overall, the Walmart cassettes performed almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's speaker, Dan Fogelman, argued in an interview on the website of Huffington Post, that the entire "less than five" Walmart employees were downgrading the work and that the protest was just "a further PR trick" of the company that organized the protests.
"Free Case!"
The Protestants continued this week in New York, however, where their goal was not Walmart films (which are not wanted and therefore are not available in this progressive city), but McDonald's and other prestigious restaurants were.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of pieces, yet you will not be given a sick day, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Juanne Williams, member of the New York City Treaty
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York law is 7.25 dollars per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage will be raised after and after, but not too strong, and in the middle it will get its easy employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
As far as it's possible to spend so little money in New York, I don't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. young people were in school after McDonald's school, but the young were still living with their parents.
Almost one saw the main comets or plants, to stay there longer.
Now I meet with people working with McDonald's constant people who complain that they will get out of this loan and sometimes have to feed their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal, there is a comment that its author notes, whether it is irresponsible to get children if you don't know how to eat them.
The participants of the protesters who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday morning before McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue called for the cashier and the cook of fast food restaurants to receive a minimum of $15 per hour, which represents more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to require the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. Act prohibits the conduct of companies to pursue this objective and remove or eliminate trade union members.
On the other hand, the company does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
On this day, there were also many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protest was a meeting the afternoon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including the city's member, Juanie Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sold billions of pieces, and yet you don't give you a sick day, and you won't pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, by the mayor's candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the hard-food workers together so that they can earn a fair wage and achieve the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the biggest act of her kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people in the area where Weitem was not all employed in the fixed food industry that works in New York tens of thousands.
It is still not to be seen whether the functions of this protest will be mobilized all the mass.
"The brain's only going to be a little oversized"
The theme of advanced reality, which was popular in modern technologies, will be adopted in recent times by the lens of a special brightness.
First, Google presented a functional model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also registered a suitable patent.
However, in the discussion with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group in Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it will be clear that the bridge for the company's scientists was just a transition.
It travels the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with just hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is dealing with.
- We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machines, however, want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has remained largely trapped in the phase, where it is worked with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also affected.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the kinect sensors are making progress, and today no Xbox is sold without kinect, as everyone is interested in moving control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue was still not decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to leave the computer world in our physical world and make it more stable.
However, it is necessary not only for the user but also for its environment to be recognised.
Then we could find the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should be rid of these certified virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of language control?
She's in love, but she won't be overestimated?
- It is certainly not the overall solution because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all about its actions and intentions.
Actually, every type of interaction with computers is good, but everyone in their particular nodes is good.
For example, we worked in the control of objects on public places on a project where we experimented with shorts and shorts, rather than with loaded gases.
The gases were not recorded by the object camera, but by a band that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, however theoretically could be reduced to the size of a barrier.
But the future, however, includes mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- Would you like me to give you this sprudel dose?
They say it and they say it at the same time.
- Normally, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does this mean you want the user to adjust to what a machine can do at any time and what?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time, we need to work especially on developing new sensor types, which will allow us to understand exactly how people react.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, as they offer a good solution in depth, which is very important.
- What challenges do you face from your work with the Xbox kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Does it involve resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main issues are not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
This is how all the current technologies are not good enough for us because the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and the Y axis, but also the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too small for ghosts.
Stephen Betties developed a contact sensor in our lab in Redmond with a regular processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, where today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much that affects the interaction of humans and machines.
For my work, I needed such an arrangement, only without reference control and with more images per second.
- Didn't the number of cameras have to be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "Cameras", one of which is actually an infrarotant and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It shall not be used to calculate the object weight.
Maybe more cameras could solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with different camera connections to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public against Google.
Don't you think that in view of the application of the technology of increased reality every day, the Brilley has the best views?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the given hand, but I think the best variant would be an "excellent" extended reality, where we could switch a cloud from the mirror to the smartphone,
The Brilliant is a personal Gadget and it has its strength (privats you can only see), but at the same time also its weakness, because an extended reality prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- We suggest for a long time that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only of Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also of normal mortality.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: There is no emotional reaction!
The hands don't smell anything!
What answers do your group want to give to this attack?
- In my presentations I often talk about the increased reality of the seven-way interaction between humans and machines.
I think the back-up could be through the integration of tactical perceptions.
An interesting method is now the use of the second hand as some unusual projection device.
It's a great print!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" a little firm, for example, create the interference of certain ultrasounds in a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that the moment is still as weak as a man's handball.
There are also bands for the hand chain that affect the nerves in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overcome the brain?
Do you think it smells what it's supposed to smell when it's just something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we have to fight for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, to believe that he is instead in an open, practically inconceivable space; here we work on concepts with running bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain is only able to pass on moderately, and there are still many years of work ahead of us.
Well, this makes the work on the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: in many subjects, we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt will continue the project "Petersburg Avantgarde" which is dedicated to the city's inhabitants who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the list read, there are already high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success goes beyond the borders of the city and often finds recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, who is dressed in red, sometimes at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene events or on Vernissagen.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are also displayed, they attract large numbers of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socio-philosophic artists who created new myth.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city, who, by his presence on the street, sells his citizens a ladder in front of him and gives them a good reward.
Before long, he cut himself down and became a Petersburg Dreorgel player, as he felt ready for this difficult role in the eyes of his artist, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in Rot and not, for example, in Gelb or Turkey in the city?
I have chosen the red color as a fashion designer that is different from the optical and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisers and society.
In society, everything is called something different from the Graunorm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to speak.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my work was performed.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old went out, but not officially recognized painters at the time, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; then came the "Pushkinskaja 10", and then it was the first time.
I love the theatre, the fashion, the music, actually everything, except literature.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to be at the centre of Petersburg culture where the best-creating artists should be gathered.
In 1995, I owned a room in Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a music and artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came in with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sing simple songs to play back, wear long triangles and to them were also part of today's said composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it was from its Leningrad.
Trachtenberg updated many programs before the time of Halli-Galli.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started its great career, but he taught us the basics.
The gallery "D 137" or "Griboedov" also has its origin in the Art Clinic.
Dorthin went to our employees and family guests.
I'm a hero of the past century, as culture still means something.
In the year 2000, there was a question in the press about the designation "Privacy of Our City".
I won the "Artists of the Year" category, and that's why I was at the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unknown style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make it clear that the reality and strength of the thoughts to express.
I'll have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be so.
In a clown, it destroys everything and destroys its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have great ideas.
For example, we save the world by predicting that everyone has to dress perfectly.
Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the outside and not the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should put him in his face.
The confusion disappears by clothing.
We'll see you in the role of the city's driver.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and easy to use.
We see the fall of cultures.
Previously, the people had formed big groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-Communitys, and it's hard to get everyone to fall.
I'm not a hundred dollar notes that everyone likes.
Now you're gonna have to tell me who you're going to fall.
Now each cultstar has about 100 subscribers.
- But thousands of people are coming to St. Michalow's show!
- He's got left women, there's the sex-social spy playing a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything is going to go down.
I have attachments, and the most important thing is not to betray them and not destroy the record.
In my youth, I have painted such pictures that even in a collection of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only came at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers have no culture at all, that's something else.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and stopped money to paint.
That's the culture I enjoyed.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good Culture Experts.
They say: ministers of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
At the real fairs, it was different because the fairs may not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts are needed.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have what experts might be, but the way will be closed, as there is a need for higher experts who evaluate the first ones correctly and free them from the path.
Now it's just your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable neighborhood.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural neighbourhood, for example, because we have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe there are many curious people visiting exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less for us.
Art must be again modern, as at the beginning of the preceding century.
The project is financed from the acquisitions of the city of St. Petersburg
Born in a World Alley
Earth in danger.
Heating or co-administration with Killer asteroid.
Karawans of spaceships with land inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question is, how can we continue to plant ourselves in the gravity or on the planet?
I don't think there are many options.
The fact is that there are only two real planets that we could at least reside hypothetically.
"Naturally Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomic Starnberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the March are relatively friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees prevails on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be in large height or in the walkway of Venus, so in all, possible.
The question of continuing growth in all was first addressed by the researchers in relation to the Flora.
A half century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the seed born into the Orbit does not differ in the smallest of the Irish species.
It followed the breeding of insects, exactly of winch fruit birds (Drosophila), in the Orbit.
In 1979, Wachtelier was sent to the world to explore how the severity of the development of Embryos was affected.
It develops a completely normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen has to be kept; it has to stand on its feet and begin to move," explains RAN, director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems, Vladimir Searchew.
Without a fixed base, the kitchens are wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely disappeared.
The kitchens didn't react to light and sound.
Four days later they just die.
"Two times we let cookies slip and then put the whole thing in, because it's easy to work there with them," says Vladimir Searchew for a broken experiment with the cookies in all places.
The last outbreak with animals flew 16 years ago into the orbit.
In the spring of 2013, experiments were continued.
However, only gender species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already born into all.
The principle has not been established separately.
"It was just with the biostalents, but once again it was only a single experiment, and research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Searchew.
After the landing, the world’s atmosphere grew.
The problem of continuing growth could not be solved directly in the world.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken out of their natural habitat can simply not follow their breeding path.
Unlike animals, humans could have the principle.
The homo sapiens are capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
However, women have been flying for 50 years in all.
The biggest risk was Tereschkova.
The most valuable thing that mankind has is the female organization.
Our mother fled from it, and no one on earth would have answered the following question: Does she understand the global flight?
Will they be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"No one finally answered this question," says space travel veteran Wachtang Watschnadase.
In June 1964, only one year after her worldwide flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkova, became a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in All, Swetlana Sawitzkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, became a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after a long flight everything went well and they got healthy.
"The more dangerous it is to fly into the orbit," concluded Cosmonaut Waller Polajakow, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
But mankind must look for new ways to biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator in the Kosmonauten preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a Swiss state, the cosmonaut routines of working in open space are won.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a strange environment; but salty waters are treated as natural elements.
It is as if the little Ichnyander witness would be saying that life in the country of the Ocean is rising.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb for about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the spring water and that it is then easier to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, since from birth to the first winter it is only once 2 weeks away.
"It's too little time to forget something," says babysitter Marina Aksenowa.
While pregnancy is therefore a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not come out without force.
In the case of difficulty, the bout and beak muscle culture is very rapidly back and therefore also takes away the ability to push the child out.
All right, let's go around that with breast-feeding aids.
The birth, for example, could also take place in a special room to force the child out.
"But what happens then?" asks the insignificant question of Valerie Polajakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial force.
Without feeling the excitement, the organism cannot train the skeletal and muscle.
A newborn child can not be stored in the orbit as an adult for training in a burden-sustainment exercise.
He will simply miss what is essential for his life.
"This experiment, which we share together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring into the world an obstacle to bringing a completely inadequate human being," said the director of the Institute's Bioethics Committee for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the world is only theory.
In any case, it will become reality when the inhabitants of the earth in their spaceships break into a remote planet that will be home to their all-born offspring.
NKU Head: Black System Control Misguided by Political Debts
Chechnya has good control stations and adequate laws in relation to public procurement, but is again applicable to them.
In the talk für Aktualná.cz says der Vizepresant des Höchsten Controllamtes (The Supreme Control Authority, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and this is not the case with us," Kala comments the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a common control by Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative example of practice, he leads the setting of Prime Minister Petr Nečás to the so-called "Black System".
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not be responsible for controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must, however, have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it cannot simply come from the President of the Government, and the control team whose duty is now the control of the law is to stop its activities," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Board of Auditors, you will talk about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries were compared to public contracts.
Why did it go that way?
It is a parallel test with which we started about two years ago.
Simply stated, it is because the European legislation sets out how public contracts are to be maintained, thereby building on national legislation, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
All of this has been compared with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have been able to identify very interesting differences. Generally, the laws with us may even be "more stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
In what way can the project be a help? What comes to you from this project?
Such a common control could help us to stop trying to ensure that we continue to improve the law and the reduction and exaggeration of thresholds if this is not likely to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicism means acquiring a matter at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unfair coverage or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even so that we only burden the system in this way with excessive "paper frame" and those who are looking for the gaps in the system, it is much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remain higher.
They discuss the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech tax legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here like our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant is the NKU of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college that is only formed differently.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, in which Germany is a Federal State, i.e. that there is also this accounting authority in the individual German countries - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal resources, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the regions and communities are under the control of the Heads of State.
With regard to German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this without specific details only minor. However, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it possible that the inspectors are better there?
This is not determined, but as it is said: I do not like such comparisons in particular.
It is still worth noting that those countries that are a model for us also have problems to deal with.
Otherwise, they had nothing to do with our authority, didn't they?
With regard to the Czech legislation, what significance did your authority have for the renewal of the tax law, do you already have any effects?
In view of the fact that these clouds are in force only for a short time, they are not yet effective in our tests.
Since our controls take place overnight, we have to count here with a certain delay.
We are still in the process of preparing for future controls - so we have introduced the new control tool "Recognition of the Risks of Inequality" and examined and analysed by this almost 14,000 public procurement - here the changes will be made on their own, since the thresholds, which have changed the conditions for certain types of expressions, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or will the system be taxed with further bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "strong" and cannot be anymore maintained.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination against the offender (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are obliged to consider that any non-compliance with the legislation of a loss of budgetary discipline is equal.
Is it worthwhile, then, to make the law more strict?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not those who have committed a form error that does not affect the real decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let's say which path is not a destination.
The Prime Minister once said that ODS did not control the company. "Black system" would be appropriate - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system currently banned or allowed?
A law must, however, have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it cannot simply come from the President of the Government, and the control team whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law will be prevented from doing so.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we do so if there is nothing.
The tax legislation contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain procedures - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the offer with the best offers is excluded only because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets, the ice-cream dominates, but they are too dry.
On the streets of Chechnya there is partly snow and ice cream.
However, the roads are very well accessible, while increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In Karlsbad district, the streets were well accessible this morning, single-handed snow and ice cream.
The temperatures fall at -5 to -10 °C, and it should be warmer.
In the region it is no longer fast, and in the deep hills there is only a thin snow deck.
However, on the entrance of the mountain is about 30 cm snow.
According to the regional road watch, Nebel's limited view was mastered.
The R6 and the transport routes of the first road class in the region are now unlimited.
However, attention has been paid, for example, to bridges on which roads are needed and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third road classes, including mountain roads, are accessible.
However, on these roads, the rails are either partially required or exhausted.
In particular in the higher levels, therefore, there is a need for increased attention.
Areas Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
On some streets east of the river is a danger because of ice-creaming, higher levels and mountain areas, while still on the streets, the road and road-direction are shared on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers against ice-creams that can occur in particular in higher locations in the area of Pardubice.
It can be especially on the roads of the second and third road classes in the districts Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitvy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitvy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the streets in the Rieging Mountains and in the Orlickö mountains.
An exhilarated snowfall lies on the streets of the circuits of Rychnov nad Knžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern mountains today it is too sunny or hot, and it remains largely free of pollution.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
Region Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen area are well accessible today, but local attention has been offered, and the road is adapted to the weather.
This is fresh in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has previously been cut and the temperatures fall continuously, it can reach ice cream on the streets.
In addition, it is important to consider Nebel, where the view is improved in the course of the day.
These data are derived from the regional road masterries.
The D5 road is practically unlimited, but increased attention is recommended, however, by road masters between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The journeys of the first class of roads are too dry, but they are frozen.
In the south of the circle of Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can reach ice cream.
The roads of the second and third road classes are cold, and therefore the reference here also applies to possible sections.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Bezirk Olomouc
With Schneematsch today, drivers who are on their way to the altitudes in the Olomouc area need to be calculated.
After the use of street vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the pass of Červenohorské seselo and on the road towards Videlský Kríž.
During the night, the street masters are forced to use, according to information from the road administration about 3 cm Neuschnee.
In the other areas of the region, the roads are usually unlimited.
"In the circle of the shumperk remain in the upper layers or the narrowest.
On the pass of Červenohorské seselo the drivers have to calculate Jeseník with Schneematsch," said one of the staff of the Šumperk Road Administration today against the ČTK Agency.
Also, their colleagues in Jeseník's circle had to come out at night, according to their data, the streets were free and naked to the high stations after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle the roads are unlimited, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers must be cautious in rural areas, since the roads are still warm here.
Bezirk Üstí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In northern mountains, road masters report the same bad road sections.
In addition to several locations with snow or ice cream, the mountain street of Telnice to Knínce in the district of Ústí n.K. is closed according to information of the transport police.
The temperatures also remain in deeper layers below zero, so snow and ice are kept on the streets. From the depths, especially south-east of the Böhmic Mediterranean mountain, there are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported until then.
Eisglatte is reported in particular from the area of Štítí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - every day over rain and freezing snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and the I/13 road along the border of Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported to be bad transport conditions.
The crossing of the road between Telnice and Knnice was necessary because of the estees that were pressed from the snowcast to the railway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think should take place in less than a month of the world's transition?
That's one of those disaster reports that we'd like to call people so much.
With our band The Tap tap, we are more interested in saying that we are the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to keep or prevent the world's transition.
In December you will also perform a unique project with three concerts against the world entrance.
Can you introduce the project closer to our readers?
It's a country-wide benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecasted for 21 December at 11:10 a.m. tomorrow.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concert should be about the time, to the one on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a period of 12 hours ahead of us, the Maya calendar ends.
Who's that idea from?
At first, I think we have developed the idea together with our graphicer Honza Augusta.
In this regard, we want not only to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's transition, but also to think together with the public about the condition in which we once passed this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keys against the world entrance, with their shopping via www.e-tap.cz, and people can also support us.
The tape tape has also included other interpreters as well. Hymne against the world entrance with the title "World entrance is falling out".
Today the Hymne is very popular on YouTube. Will they also be awarded to the benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, it is expected that everything will collapse and that the end of the world will not occur...
The Hymne should be won at the same time by all interpreters at all three concerts.
In addition, the Hymns will be transmitted live together in a direct operation of the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both of you?
We also cooperate with other characteristics of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the realization of many beneficial events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most of us are interested in cooperation and have enjoyed it.
What is the purpose of the opening of the concerts against the entrance of the world?
For the establishment of the Barrier Free Education Centre, where we have been working together for six years with the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly visited by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to search the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
Within the framework of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a private building should be built in which we join this project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters appear.
What criteria have you examined?
We wanted to bring together a program that all generations, including children, are responding to.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratorium with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Learn more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May we will meet for the first time at Prague Spring, and for this concert we will also prepare an interesting program with interested guests.
The next year, we would also like to be in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would like to be connected with the events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not only small, as long as you have been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the backroom. Besides, we have to mix with many tools and other packages...
Unfortunately, it has always suffered without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes been partially surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were far away, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with freedom of choice, how you deal with people who are disabled, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnesses to the fact that in the east there is still everything in its beginnings.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is certainly not an obstacle. It is still unusual if someone is in the wheelchair alone in the city center.
It is not even understandable, for example, that a wheelchair driver is presented in the lift.
Fortunately, there are also groups that are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what sense do we have to stop against the further developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're dealing with...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe obstacles can also move themselves in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just common that there is a larger group of people who are actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead with the band The Tap Tap to the west!
Respect in public and barriotism is a matter, but only when important sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawmakers come out of our ranks, things will really start to change.
As long as these are only individual cases of particularly desirable personality.
The Tap Tap is now very popular. But if we go back a few years, what have you motivated you to build a band in 1998?
At the time, I was appointed as a minister at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and, like Saxofon, I have founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, it's like our moderator, Ládáa Angelovic, to say, made something out of control (laughs).
But the band was known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that we have helped to cooperate with famous singers; we have also begun to compete actively for us.
We have become aware that if something is done and this is not to be seen outside, it does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can deliver good lecturers, high-quality equipment, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I've been thinking of the potential that you can handle things differently.
In the show business today, one of the others is often copied.
This is logical in its way, since all new things are considered with caution and will only be accepted for a long time.
There are only a few things really unique, and I'm careful to assume that Tap tap is part of it.
The first impression that the audience has most is of course compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely excessive because people with obstacles are not united and left to be repentant.
It is people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the means needed to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities do something wrong, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a tough leader, how do you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also ask for a certain discipline.
But this is completely normal in my opinion.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have tests twice a week, they have to complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the excitement is spread quickly by many.
But it works everywhere, in every band that works hard and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Ládáa Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop.
Whoever has the will and the pleasure on the sidewalk is always welcome to us.
Located on the day before the forecasted world time, Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 21 am
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three types of events will be linked together at the end of the live movement, and it explains a common interpretation of the Hymne "Welting Fall Out" of the band The Tap Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide the means for the provision of a multifunctional educational centre that is to be established under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age free of charge, maps are available for sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the world room.
Last week Poland was elected to a ministerial meeting of the members of the ESA's European World Trade Organization as the twentieth member of this World Trade Organization. Poland is therefore the second member of the former Eastern block (after Czech Republic, which was a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
In 1994, Poland began to work closely with the ESA and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into the world room began at a very early stage.
Before the Second World War, Polish cosmologists had been working on space, so they did not always understand.
I recall here, for example, the speech by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author was thinking of his pioneer work "Enter into Cosmonautik".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Sternfeld won in 1934 for "Engaging to Cosmonautics" the prize created by Robert Esnaul-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important founder of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s widely recognized contribution to the development of space was, inter alia, confirmed that one of the craters was named after him on the rising side of the moon.
Already in 1925, a railway trailer was built in Poland for which a rocket operation was planned.
The author of the project and the details of this project are unfortunately unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rockets should be used to launch or brake the pipes.
This information comes only from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to have sex with rockets.
The research led the Institute of Kořka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It is evident from the documents delivered that research has been proposed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then freely interrupted by the introduction of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, Ing. Rohozinski's professional printing of the original design of a photo-electrical jagdraket, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powiertzna i rakietbombba lotteryniza" appeared.
Both projects included the military use of the rocket industry.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the previous Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczaswow Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Tovarzystwo Astronautique) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in the November issue of the magazine Problem, in the four extensive articles of space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there had already been the first projects for satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the research of the world space would have a future.
Already in its early years in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA sought to join the 1951 International Space Federation, and the PTA was already an official member in the autumn of 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), acting President of the International Federation of Space Traffic.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA has been involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum plane height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and was not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and began in 1959 in the Blądõw West Flights with the two-wheeled RM-2.
The rocket was 1,4 m long and weighed about 11,5 kg.
Another development stage should already be able to provide real scientific work - the RM-34 rockets should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring high winds.
However, further development was introduced in 1962.
Following the first rockets of the RM type, the Meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-wheeled rocket, its total length was 510 cm, and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
These rockets have developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, a meter-1B over 0.34 litres and a meter-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude is 37 km at all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aviation institute, which began their first flights in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg benefit load to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in the interkosmos programme with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second interkosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on joint work is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court upheld the law on joint works.
This Decision called for a lively discussion in the public.
It is of particular interest to consider the problem once again from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are united in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital that goes hand in hand with endless financial speculation.
Because of the great difference in the value of work (loan) it comes to price savings.
In this sense, it is a condition in which the manufacturer tries to establish a more favourable priced product in economic competition by ‘subsisting competition’ in order to increase its market share and increase its profit.
At a high level, this means for most companies to put their production abroad or buy it at a price, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not have social responsibility and therefore does not bear responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase State expenditure.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the employers are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics at this point are overflowable.
In the individual economies of the private sector, a situation where governments are forced to compete together in order to reduce the social level of their own people artificially and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own people with no reference to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to the applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own people to accept the dictatorship of private capital, in particular in the field of wages.
This is due to an economic burden on long-term unemployment, on the other hand by breaking the rights of workers.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between arms and wealth.
In Germany, there has been a few years of public food supply for the poor who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of victims has already reached millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is regularly due to cases where workers receive less wages that the state has to increase its income to the minimum of existence.
A similar scandal was also detected in the case of aid forces employed in Germany.
The precautionary measures of all EU countries will no doubt go beyond the same situation in which people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a catastrophic turnout of their social levels (as in the 19th century), or to work for a famine at the borders of society, hoping that private investment will eventually be transferred to the country.
The question is, of course, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, it is only the poverty of another country; or the capital remains quite the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, and in Africa, the workers are working for a share of European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media have claimed that the State must not participate in its own economy with capital, and that the plan economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital needs to be strictly based on its position that the State cannot enter the economy slowly.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not affect politics and thus affect the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a practically all-powerful and modern Lobby in all the states.
The result is a double situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, a law enforcement, in which virtually everything is violent, but is not criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry lacks private funding, close to legal firms in the industry, with the development of legal entities.
These provisions shall be adopted accordingly on the day of the Federal Republic of Germany.
All violence, then, is no longer from the peoples, as the Western Constitutions declare, but from strong financial groups that express their own interests.
Clearly, the liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation as they described in their work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesars and Pompeys: "The state has long been understood, and the mothers have been raped with violence.
Anti-smoker money, by unlawful comparison of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unhindered, and the people went with the votes already bought for the election" ... "People with character don't keep to themselves, so the state due to this decline had no consular for eight months" ... "I've already started to talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation, and that a strong man must be chosen" ... Apipian thought, however, of Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who has been replaced by the only government.
As it turns out, today's society, as well as in the Antique, is based on the unreliability of its own advantage, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
The private capital is already not in a position to recognize and apply the benefit of the whole society.
The result, as in the past, today is an unprecedented decade of elites who do not strive to reform deeply.
The reason for the rise of Fascism and communism must therefore be seen in the unprecedented liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state of mind, the transition of this regime can be seen as a temporary break for the benefit of liberal democracies, where the next round is already behind.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites are in total ignorance about the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of people in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are now witnesses, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the old and new history.
The suspension of the law on joint work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czechs will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore required by the system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the State's share of capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopolization of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing comes out of violence, or could ever come out" sing Sting in song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain says: "...so that we don't forget how broken we are."
"If my son didn't want any war, don't do it," says the dying Goodel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
The one behind Israel argues with its right to self-defence, while they refer to the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the State of Israel, the killing of the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is in this constantly repeated wave of the death of the debtor and who is the victim; finally, the modern inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am therefore going to open the eyes of the readers behind the cults, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are serviced in the small Flecken Land near the East.
My thoughts are partly based on the historical facts available, others are guided by these and are guided by my own understanding of who or what group of people has a significant impact on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle against power.
In every era, we can make an Alexander the great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne someone who tied their actions to a particular goal.
We must realize that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is being concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and its superior power has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a particular one that can be described as the head of the cancer (I don't know whether anyone else is over them, but I don't close this up) - the Rothschilds.
Many will not be written about her.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) has been purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century to connect their name with high-crime acts, in which they always restrict their power, their wealth or both.
Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they engage in wars or fight against them (before the fall in Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the fall in Iraq, there were only 5 countries, after the Ghaddafis strike, only four others, in which Russia undertook its Central Bank of the Russian Government in the meantime).
Anyone who has always tried to resist this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln urged him to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, beginning during the civil war, to issue his own (speak: state) notes and was killed in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own notes and wanted the FED to be released - he was murdered in 1963; Lieutenant Louis McFadden was sentenced in 1936, after he wanted to accuse the FED of the global economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan for the resolution of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freimer of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the major monarchy states of Europe, in particular the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of such people would provide for their conveniences and luxury and not use as much resources), create a universal religion (the eco-ism is no longer the case) and ultimately lead to the taking of the absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschild on the tip is the solution of a crisis and the next offer of a solution (or from chao - order from Chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that crises like they were solved in 1907).
After they had been defeated by the murder at the Habsburg Trondinand, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, to eliminate the first world war, they broke the Russian Zarenia through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the gradual, military and economically unfounded capitalization of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Empire), followed by the resolution of the Central European Grand Duchy of Austria.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the Bankers were able to create a latent conflict by putting Germany to war with giant war repairs; thus, they created the condition that the Germans only had to defeat a strong leader who called the accused and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take on the function of a five-colon and also take the role of the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Roths children began the creation of the Zionist movement, with which a two-way attempting to establish a Jewish state, possibly in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour declaration created the prerequisite for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine; it came first in contact with the Arab population concerned.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and whether Hitler was now out of the chains of losris, where the international banks had initially held him, or if he loved everything according to the plan, it is only difficult to appreciate that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by war repairs against Germany on the ground for the Second World War, the establishment of the State of Israel's fuel point for the Third World War is a fact.
When it comes to the international banks to end this war, the Jewish people will be like the second world war to sacrifice in the first battle, this time with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge lab, a source of the country and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (one can only think about how people in the Angger and the enemy of Israel were involved).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice is only resolved in an endless spiral of violence, where at the beginning were the gods of individualism and their efforts to gain global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international banks in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are only able to select their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician who has been loyal to the international bankers who is doing all they can to start a war with Iran, which, in view of the membership of Iran in the Schanghaier Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could soon spread to a global conflict, and with the control of Iran over only 2 miles wide streets of Hormus, over 20% of the world's oil supply, could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefellers of 1994: "The only thing we need is an exciting crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of Lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financiers.
A world in which every newborn is introduced a chip at birth to defeat this being of total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give a sign in their right hand or in their breasts that no one can buy or sell, because he has the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: Call Hollywood when it's the worst
In November 1979, a mob of Islamic students occupied the US mission in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the release of the wounded Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the Patronat under his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the boat overboard because this would seriously damage the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not in the position of Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime was supposed to replace the liberation of the churches.
It was a serious blow to the United States' reputation, and the subsequent Fiasko in the violent attempt to free the spirits only made things worse.
The prisoners' diplomats were finally released 444 days after negotiation by the Algerian government.
The shell of the geese called at home a wave of solidarity and anti-iranic voices.
The debate in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that protected the United States a small part.
At the moment before the message was delivered, six MEPs arrived at the airport.
This ended after many complications in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA started working with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagance story to cover their true identity - they travel with Canadian passports trained as a member of a film staff who visited Drehorte in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The plan developed by experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to convince the tournament, articles on this film project appeared in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fixed production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a real politician, but at the same time also a "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a winning housepiece, such as the film Ocean's life.
As a result, the voices are changed - on the one hand, the documentaries from Tehran (in the title box, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the composition of the same situations, there are no great differences).
On the other hand, the locker passports from Hollywood, which come in ironically and easily overcrowded.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men at the conference desk, on the officelights, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has won a remarkable new start in his career with this film.
From a local actor, he has become a respected director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third play film after the Crimea No Children's Games (Goon Baby Gone, 2007) and Triller City without Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleks's first film that doesn't play in the local boss of the director.
The smell of the local atmosphere was among the features that attracted the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this dream in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are played on the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the initial sequence of the first impression of the message is very impressive in its transparency, and still reveals the sense of confusion and inevitability, which occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck with his team also achieves a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false film tab on a baser in Tehran).
Too many operations in too many locations
The director also had to make it clear that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But with the little one, he works really well, where he sometimes helps with the reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the coming crisis on Teheran airport is stopped by a telephone in America, or the persecution on the train, seem to be a bit more exciting).
The weakness of Argo is its very broad strain, which is required by necessity, to show too much on action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures have earned more space, and thus they are not alone in the film.
Afflecks Film is losing something on learning. It is a film that you can follow with some interest and go to the design and to a triller from the 70s that reminds you of retro style.
However, it is only a matter of concern.
However, as a reminder of a certain way of living piece of history and as evidence of how the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are carried out, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the launching of air balloons, bananas and circuses
The server, www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who annually raises a question about the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to launch the competition "Abstainest Regulation or idea from the EU's workshop".
"This idea led us to the EU's short-term plan to introduce 40% of women in the management of large European companies," said Patrick Nacher, who was concerned about the organisation of this survey, against the newspaper Právo.
For example, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has ruled that the insurance rates for men and women are compatible with the so-called absurdities.
To this end, women benefit from life insurance because they are objectively at lower risk for insurance companies.
"To the end of this year, further unbelievable incidents from the EU's workshop can be nominated.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher shared with him.
The contested EU regulations include, inter alia, the binding linkage of bioethanol to fuels resulting from them, which further prohibits the reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of these hazardous substances, or also the Directive on the size of carbon captures due to their material value in this year.
Critics in the past also found the actual ban on the use of the term "boutteraoutstritch" or also the ban on sales for traditional glitches.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose requirements are normally met in Brussels by one or more Member States (such as Czechs are currently trying to implement the requirements of Czech banks with Veto printing).
Lobby interests also claimed that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not be "crowding anomaly".
The European Commission argued with the argument that it would only harmonise the unilateral national standards that would prevent trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been strengthened with the indication that the previous guidelines would lead to food poisoning.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to air balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age cannot blow the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU is therefore engaged in an American study, which, according to the Air Balloons, is the leading cause of abortion of children.
A similar restriction is already applicable to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market flows.
Kuriose accidents are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which applies to European officials themselves - any who assume official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of the liberal economies of Laissez Faire, the Bankovnípopplatky.com server also designated the EU regulation on the volume of food products in the territory of a Member State.
The EU therefore established the maximum volume of food supplies that remained on the day of our EU accession to the Czech Republic.
Chechnya then passes over the fixed volume for Pilz Reserves, for which a high amount of fines cost us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money in order to have no sea, or by the idea of providing aid for applications for aid money.
These ideas came from, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are so blessed that we have no more.
We will be asked to return to the EU," said Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the third party had been very high and that the State camp was filled with the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czechs have another way to sea, the EU should pay us a hundred million euros, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission concluded that it organized a statement on the purchase of third countries that have no access to the sea.
In particular, the Ministry of Regional Development, under the direction of Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), is responsible for providing funds for the establishment of promotional loans in Brussels.
EU: Foreign regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States, however, are easily addressed to the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and therefore also to develop efficiency and development throughout the European Union, in the opinion of some experts.
A serious problem is that these experts believe that EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the expansion of European integration, but which have been forced into budgetary negotiations by individual Member States.
It also highlights the fact that Czechs, like other Member States in Brussels, have to fight the right to use specific designations of traditional products and do not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, Chechnya was able to defend the name "Olomoukké vorážky", the Inlanderum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition returned to us until the 19th century, however, our producers had to be called "Tuzemák".
The name Rum can only be used for products of sugar root distillate, not for products of sugar stoppers.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipan or Parmaschinken are now included in the company of the world’s famous cheese varieties, also the Karlsbader Zwieback, Carpfen of Pohorèlice and Třebonj, or the Saazer Hopfen.
The Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Horícer roles can be broken by a EU mark.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how are you going to apply for the president's office?
I'm not going to be a senator or a president.
If everything would work in our country without problems, I would apply anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plagued for 20 years, how Dibe is free to go back, while people are increasing taxes and interest rates.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to propose a solution to change it.
And since I am already over 40, independent and divided, I have no other chance to influence things than to apply for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you have created it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
Don't you take your voters back?
I've been telling me all the time that I'm going to take the battle around the city after the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I made this clear and said that I would apply for the President's office if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
But the difficulty is not only that we act as people in the bathroom and before the TV, but that we make everyone who wants to change something.
To this end, the media who want to rob one of honor and exchange the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was thought to be a journalist or to be a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight against the castle has taken over 20 million crowns with the emphasis on the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive statements of power.
You have to change your rules to that.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have used myself to ensure that the tour guide remains free of charge, and this could be carried out.
The problem is the small-scale policy - if one comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is obviously rejected, and this only holds the population up.
As an independent participant, I have a greater potential to receive support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take it without any thought of training or participation by any party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more right or left?
From a Czech look, I think people see me on the left.
For me, this right-left mind is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we go on.
I don't care if anyone's on the left or on the right; I want to connect people.
I always support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You miss someone who calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to do.
You can refer this to me as populism, but all the suggestions I have spoken are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will only be left with words.
And that's why you don't go far in politics for a long time.
Or do you think it is for you, if you just talk to the people for a long time, will it be possible, for example, to take over material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other chance.
Politicians, journalists and the public are convinced and tried to bring them to our side to pursue these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the Presidents of Parliament to live in the televisions to legalize the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and state officials.
And then the speakers had to tell you why they refused to do this.
A strong personality that points to misunderstandings can exert pressure on the political scene.
You only take the President's direct choice, which was a public press service.
I'm very clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find links to my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and tried to find support for my programme for the majority.
I always try to evaluate things myself; and if it doesn't work, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little less like Okamura Czechia should be saved.
I'm not a judge.
I know that I have not achieved anything by myself; that is why I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they do not wish to apply for the Senate either.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jancura, who refused to work because of his work load.
In addition, I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the amount of light oil in trade.
I started my application with the condition that people are deeply unhappy, but now I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the eligible have not attended the elections, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent people.
People have chosen such a composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Do you think about setting up a own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I have no time to check the past of every potential member of the Party, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZKs.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about statements of power, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a basic piece with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Scotland Superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have a few million more on the account.
The Aston Martin was still a child room - James Bond always liked me as he walked in the car, was kind of a woman, and fought evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a wealth of 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want your own money to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I blame you for this?
I've already buried 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program doesn't seem to have much interest.
And I am not obliged to combat the campaign from my own resources.
The costs for the campaign will be taken on the basis of my content as a senator.
But I couldn't live by the senator's content alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I wouldn't apply for anything.
So do you continue to act as an entrepreneur to have your exit?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But this does not depend on the amount of money.
As promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, my representative will be the head of the travel office in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live with something.
In what month's income were you used to be an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the same.
However, as President, I would fully set up my businesses.
The complete conversation will be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - for example of the archipelago and the most recent bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verheig, a passenger on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Well, it's nice already, the house."
But I wonder why we need a book today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man today goes voluntarily into this old style library, right?
Treasures, a hardly necessary sleep city in front of the Rotterdam Towers, is a unique record holder.
The 80,000 residents' community shows the lowest education rate in the entire Netherlands.
In order to counteract this foolish condition, it was decided to contribute to general education a few years ago and to build up the seven fixed bridges that are shown on the euro coins as well as carefully designed steel concrete minimizations.
The success of education offensive was limited.
And so the mayor recognized that there was only one chance to become the Statistics Lord: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdamer architecture office MVRDV, master of the Tolling Barken Diagrams and producer of white, yes often sininic buildings, took the matter with the usual flexibility and appeared to competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under arm and a border in face.
And while the jury continued to look around and touched with the sharks, the fresh Maas stood up to his readings of the size to a pyramid and ended up with the words: "Love City Community!"
So he is my proposal for the Bicherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euros of your mountain have been destroyed.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which includes also deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent housing houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is why the invisible small town trout, which had not to offer up to date, was no longer a post-modern footing zone and an unfathomable house hall, after which white fascists would have been able to prevent a mollusc tree from reaching a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, there is now doubts about the first public culture in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under Käsegloke.
There is a lift that leads through mountain massives, but the true space and reading pleasure come to an end when the topography emerges.
The surrounding inner space is clear and visible, the fireplaces burned and the elegant streets speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at Parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And all books, books, books.
"Normarily, the book's rules stand along the fassade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space, which is most uncomfortable and personal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on the head and pushed the reading range from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used: Offices, Internet Library, Schachclub, Environment Centre and House Engineering Centre are located in the center.
A special joy is the black booking rules, which are sometimes wall clothing, sometimes weddings, sometimes mountain landscapes.
Optics, harps and greuchs are strange.
Even single-favoured architects and construction engineers protect the head of the unknown building.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at the city community store, at the request of the standard.
And that's how we spent a day on a suitable waste product from agriculture in a free-land agricultural sector.
For many years it has been used in the Netherlands in growing houses and in fields as a millimeter-dung plastic bottle.
That's cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it's rich for the sperm powder.
For the library, the liquid - first in these quantities - was printed into four inch thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogenous, taxable material, which reaches up to new and even to sports.
After 105 steps, you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journey, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and finely decorated fig trees.
They provide for the atmosphere, but especially for the correct air humidity in the literary mountains.
Spending for the new souls
"I wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass areas, a preview project in puncto Ecology," says Truborst.
Hidden and cooled with heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass tube, the sun itself seems to be only short into the inside in days.
The wide range of wood alloys that are attached to glass façade serve as pollution and capture a large part of the solar radiation.
The space air is very pleasant.
The rest is caused by complete automatic rollovers.
Stefan Spermon, the beginner of the IT branch, is already on the way to the new books.
Lisette was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the bookieberg as a spy "longer overcrowded soul".
The reason: For opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to purchase a book from his personal stock.
This is the first time that the optical loops should be filled in the yet uncompleted library - now 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept is over.
The regals have been filled up.
"Nothing is worse than a half-book," says Architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for a zirade.
This is why MVRDV has won the king's discipline, which is referred to as the Fachjargon Identity Foundation.
Records have written literature history.
She's so young and she doesn't like it either.
This is finally a point of reference for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has voted in favour of the adoption of the vote by Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-European relations, Berlin is thus balanced on a small degree of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had first notified that it would vote against the request for a observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin became part of it.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held the vote when it went to set up a flight ban zone.
This was finally carried out by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to have a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy into a German foreign policy, and that is to say, from a policy so managed by the United States.
Unfortunately, the Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
The Germans are therefore found opposite between the fronts.
You expect them to play an independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're still trying to figure out their role, but they're on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to refer to positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners in national interests.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, so it is from exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests have an impact on the stand in the Nahost conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one thing, Germany has large retail markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
That is why it must be careful not to stand before the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in every case.
But I would not want to attach too much weight to him, which is not a whole single relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German transfers.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by having been involved in important decisions of the vote, perhaps in the vote on Palestine?
I believe, in Europe and even in the United States, there is great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic mess as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for this.
Because it indicates that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States has clearly spoken for a Veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama is secretly very much aware of the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not even so excited by Netanjahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if there were a coherent and united European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line, and instead they have to move things out of their own position.
That's exactly what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - will Germany take over a major troll?
Or does Germany still find leadership to be difficult?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, different anti-German feelings will be free.
That's not easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This is how Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be accessible to different neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
Now, the US's influence on European policy is constantly taking place, but the EU is not filling this vacuum, but who else remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable for them and it makes them even more unhappy - c'est la vii!

"Marken protection" in China: When Puma and Armani gradually become Chinese
Armani is also a well-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
However, a name officially registered in China which does not have anything to do with the company of origin.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real names don't complain.
And even then it's not clear whether they get the right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the branch office of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection rights violations in Fernot.
Every week, a new case is on my desk.
The neighbours already have a few additional letters so that they can register their brands.
This is how you get from Gucci just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, i.e. of the sports article manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was allowed to protect the brand of Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Hermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world masters are spiritual property in copying and losing.
In large cities, there are multiple buying houses that sell almost exclusively bottles.
Pattloch's cases are different: In his mandate, he assumes that Chinese companies from the brand office are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected otherwise.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpia", a trademark.
The word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
In this way, women are meant to be appointed to a great number of men.
The Chinese authorities are innocent of any guilt
"It's harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand will be watered, the setting will disappear, the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive preview products.
According to CLSA, China has a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, the solutions of the double entries in the market register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be withdrawn with an unknown exit.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court filed complaints because after the long time of the alleged name has become "martreality".
If the plaintiff has Pich, he must even pay the plaintiff money because he lost his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Known cases also include graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump penmeister.
That's why the Chinese can still use a emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the fight was sealed, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against neighbours from Hong Kong and Singapore who looked at the famous Crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
However, the brand name CTMO in Beijing indicates that there was a lack of staff and space equipment in 2010 due to lack of capacity.
In the past year, however, the "notification back to normality at work".
In this way, the unprocessed demand procedure is reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 requests for completion are still pending in the Office.
Daydreaming costs too much
As often as in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, CTMO submitted more than 1.4 million applications for market protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China introduces the list of new announcements across the world for the tenth time, sharing with the authorities.
This also applies to the stock of all valid brands, total 5.5 million pieces.
An estimated 1.8 billion Yuan were taxed in 2011.
Simply this means that each registration is costing 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the contrary, it is a multiphase, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has fought against a Chinese plaintiff.
However, the Germans were able to realize that their illicit manufacture of imitation motor vehicles was lifted.
However, the neighbour continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg mark.
It has been forgotten, since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand name CTMO showed the claim of the Munichners as well.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opposition continues to fight.
You've got to take care of yourself.
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and commends the professionality of the court.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely exciting and costs us much time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were almost too close to the fact that the firm archive had to look into the old documents for evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg presented a "high six-six-six-six-six-pound euro" to the opposite side.
"You see how much we value it," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernot are even moving back to Europe.
Then, if there are unprotected brands.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long been up against the company, although it could withdraw the registration.
"I have to take it easy," Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to leave on international market rights, more than the foreigners should "all that is something of protection, even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is under the last act of his brand-name, then you must pay the opposite license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be forced out of the market in the question segment.
World Day: Stamps, Songs, Help
In Heidelberg the Chor Imbongui - and in Swaziland, aidsweisen rejoices about it.
The history of a connection that exceeds more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there are the stamps: Cowboys, basketball shoes, ladies and gentlemen looking for the ticket on the park floor, find him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then, the voices of the singers slow down - old, bass, tenor and soprano - weigh, beat, and follow.
And Fiete Hope, the 29-year-old director, has almost been out of his pockets when he brings them together with his lovely wishes.
It is Montagabend, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the chor Imbongi is trying a new song.
Five singers and singers, between 23 and 69 years of age, came from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each chorstome has another text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help help
Around the world there are about 34 million HIV infections, which are estimated to be unaided, the United Nations AIDS control programme.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 people live in Aidswesen.
More than 40 percent of the population are between HIV positive.
For 180 aidsweisen in Esitjeni village, the United Voices for Africa Paten has been found in Germany.
70 of them visit a continuing school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child’s education, training and a warm meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Impopi means to Zulu historians or also to the lobbyists.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, Chor Lieder has been in this foreign soft language and has brought her back and back to where she originally came from: in South Africa.
Since 8,733 km from Heidelberg, in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German Chores.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some even in simple wood and wood huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they are infected with HI virus.
In Esitjeni it is shown in the small, all over Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
cuts in the male population, which are likely to reduce the exposure risk by half, are not accepted by the population.
More than 14 percent of the people in Swaziland take the immunosuppression virus into their hands, with the average dying of thirty is not rare.
At a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, the Chor discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only missing from parental care, but poor at all: food, clothing, education.
Without the end of school, there is no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal every day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa", who was almost professionally concerned about the AIDS virus in Esitjeni.
Facts for sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
To the bacterial STI, the syphilis, chlamydens and trippers (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STI are HIV, Human Pappilomavir, Herpes Genital or Hepatitis.
Filzleaus and creams belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main target groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are mainly seen in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute concludes that at least four of the five cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults, Chlamyden infections, Trichomonade, Candidosis (Pilz), Tripper and Human Papillomavir are frequent sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively small among heterosexual adults in these countries, however: around 20 per cent of HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, Chlamydie infections occur significantly more frequently than in other populations.
According to European estimates, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In these countries, Pappilomavir is also common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
The number of syphilis infections has been doubled by the Robert Cook Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV infections has returned since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
This is about a decade less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disorder?
Infection disorders may cause joint cramps, urinary disorders, rashes, undergrowth pain, as well as rashes or swellings.
However, they may not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of arrest, but do not offer a 100% protection.
Because, in part, governments of sexually transmitted diseases may also be allowed to continue through urinary infections and acute body contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular investigations, particularly in case of frequent exchange of sex partners.
Early diagnosis of most STIs can be healed and avoided later.
Through patents, donations, and not the last steps that the choir is going through in Germany, some come together.
"All of us have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the Union.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamin, a self-conscious and powerful woman, manages money from Germany.
She is also concerned that the cows are well dressed, with one of the big ladies.
The Gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 toilets, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day at the time of school.
The one who has no more comes to Khanyyle's house for protection, a single woman who is paid from the union just like the two cooks who cook more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has called a nearby school in life, built two houses and organized together with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because the disease in the whole country is as obvious as it is, you move it to the most popular.
A King With 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it is rare in a country where the King officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excellent lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also responsible for this stately life-threatening form that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many wanderers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms go on every corner," says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flash to flash."
To promote the cultural exchange, Imbungui-Chor travels all two, three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of passion, struggle spirit, trust and black self-consciousness, many of which are still known in the southern tip of the black continent from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites, singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings praise and joy, but also some gray border soldiers have already drowned a few trains.
The trip also leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their pets.
Even if you never find the small village on land maps, it is more known than in the valley of the Ezololo river.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," the people say there.
And if you go back to Heidelberg the 8733 kilometers airline, to the impressive singers in the Probeum on the Bergheimer Street, then you can see that too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Merkur
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is a Merkur Eis on the planet.
The icedecks may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although he is next to the sun, there are also frozen water, as from three studies published on Thursday in the Science magazine.
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the planet’s permanently damaged region.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water may have come from comets or perhaps also asteroids that are attached to the mark.
No one brings the fund of ice, but with the existence of life on the planet in relation to it, said the major scientist of the Messenger-Sunde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the marker can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the funds could help to clarify how water and other structures of life have been reached in other areas of the solar system.
Unmarked by earth’s citizens are suns, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to explore the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send images to the earth: Small gucklöchers in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who moves around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is no "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomy Union of 2006.
This image section shows a "family port" of countless stars: The oldest stars are to be identified as blue points, and it is difficult to identify the pink "newborns" in the star's crystal.
This star-shaped region - by scientists called unRomantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in Cassiopeia's star image, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This striking glut of a dying star has taken up the spy telescope of Nasa.
The donut-proforming ring consists of material that drew the stars out of the star process.
In the huge trifide Nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars come from gas and dust.
Nasa's spy telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth site.
The Plejaden Star House, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the only eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better aligned.
As a red age, the Helix Nebel looks at this infrared photo against the viewer.
It is 700 light years away from the Aquarium star image.
His comparability with an Irish continent brought this Nebel the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photos ensures spectacular coloring.
These babies could only be included in his full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As they originated, is one of the great ruins of astronomy.
They may be the rest of a Saturn-Montenegro, who disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most difficult recordings of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
After coloring, the recording of spiral galaxies will be made of real works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Guard shows the thousands of light years away from the Trifid Nebel in the Star Chart for protection.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (dry, triangular) as dark dust flows through the shining heart of the star's birthplace.
In the star chart, astronomers photographed the predictions of a cosmic carbolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two convulsive galaxies come together and are bound to collating constantly.
This star generation drew the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not have technical cuts, who may call them the southern crater at their top name.
The photo of the World Space Telescope Hubble shows an extract from the Irisnebel in the Star Image of Kepheus.
The 1400-year-old nebel consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal household staff.
This picture was combined with optical and röntgen recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a call from black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of Galaxies, named Arp 273, adopted the World Space Telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The largest spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this starboard is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The stars always produce a new Youngster.
Also these star clouds, connected with the Rosette Nebel, bring forth new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was created shortly after the Urknall, when it was found in the universe to be a prelude to water.
Our views in All: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was to be discovered in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galileo used it a year later for star observation.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescope has been increasingly larger - and the insights they provide are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Halle Telescope in the Palomar observatory was near San Diego's world's largest remote route.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope.
It lets look into all the same over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The life of the Grand Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - only the mirror reaches 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Part of the valuable construction: Telescope is to be fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed in the high angle.
Its speciality: the high force of light.
This is enough - although relatively small - to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear all of this from outsiders.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help each computer owner by providing computer services.
Look at the Observatory of the European Stargate (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - it makes his name all honour.
With all four mirrors, the remote may also clear the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO observatory.
Its main mirror is to cover 42 meters - and with almost 1000 mirror elements together.
However, with images it is early 2018 to calculate.
By 2007, the two keck telescopes were the largest in the world on the Hawaiin volcano Mauna Kea.
They offer just two mirrors with each average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is still looking at them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on Mauna Kea is to create a new, large telescope - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here is an illustration to show.
The most important impression from all, however, is the World Space Telescope Hubble.
Since April 24th, 1990 it has already delivered images from remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the World Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for extra-solated planets - mainly for those who are viable.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the latest startup preparations are documented at the World Space Telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot at a Ariane5 rocket in All by 2018.
The primary mirror of the world-wide fraternal telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Orcnacle.
Scientists believe that there is also in the South Pole of the Merkur Eis.
However, there is no reliable data for this, since the messenger is far closer to North Pole than the planets.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that it exists on the Merkur Eis.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to cross the Merkur – now has the knowledge of scientists.
Drink butter daily - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A survey in the country, which is still young at 97 years of age.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A survey in the country, which is still young at 97 years of age.
The road through the Thai mountain is to be called wild-romantic.
The small bus runs across the curved road, across densely controlled hills, flowing rivers and simple farm houses.
It's all green and soft, you could be mine, you'd be in the black hole.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is the Cuban group of Thais who are not very well known, except that they speak perfectly Persian as well as Austrian and are very long.
End station is Lerik.
The small towns have a very well-known architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the Malerian mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come almost here, too unfortunate is the approach of Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours because the road is only clear.
The true wealth that the country appreciates its oil in the Caspian Sea is not yet here in the province.
But Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the witness to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was celebrated in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival for the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, which is probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Thais from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years a child is still shown
However, the disputed star of the museum is the Schafihirte Şirali Müslimov, who was supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Muslim age seems to be twice as likely.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he was still showing a daughter.
So Şirali Muslim has been counting on his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an elderly researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been heard by the top officials in Central Asia.
"There are also many high-quality people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hanza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are very many very old men."
However, because of the lack of evidence, there is no scientific evidence to guide the age, especially the lack of personal status registers.
Squashed butter every day
The fact is, however, that people in the region often reach a Biblical age around Leik.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high days live here in the south?
The Assyrian travel leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Thais.
The museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is on the food.
However, that the calorie diet should be so healthy that the meat, bread and, above all, milk products, and many of which drink a glass mixed with butter daily, also appear to be not purely plastic in the scientific view.
Or is it the original way of life that people hold young? In Cangemiran, a twenty-five-six settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years of age, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 trips, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a Butter phase that unsatisfieds her.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both are long-term grandparents.
Two kids also run around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea that is served in the typical, bulging Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and Glyed, under her head cover she hides long, dark-brown teeth, which fills her son's pride before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never walked out on me and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly interest is sufficient to live
She always ate only what was produced by her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, vegetables.
For the rest of my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
The worst was the second world war in time.
But everything was better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the wheel.
The propaganda sounds rarely from the mouth of an old woman.
But the culture that is passed around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, is hardly known for its borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003, he was in power, and later his son, Ilham, took over the wheel.
There is no note under Azerbaijan's age.
230 manat (i.e. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a loan, for these relationships a amount from which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has a long-term son who has been growing up: "The old enjoy our culture."
They live among the great family, are loved, cared for, and are happy.
If that's not the reason, stay as long as possible in life
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising customers in Cairo reveal the deep column of the country.
The future constitution with the Scharia as a basis is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian President did not share with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he is lying in charge of me, before the people and before God," he said in the state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian leaders, the liberals, the declared Muslims and the sacraments.
Because they all, so far, are hopelessly divided into a confused opposition, have fear.
Fear before a state of God at the Nile of grace of the mighty Muslim fraternity.
He has said, as Mohammed Mursi said almost innocently, to cut down on the competences of the Constitutional Court and extend its competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a doctorate of the U.S. University of South California really wants to save himself is the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
Whether the action is enabled.
In fact, the 234 articles, which were partially concerned by the 100-captained constitutional assembly of Islamic-dominist-dominated Parforceritt, were spent in a night, 15-hour parforceritist.
As in previous articles, it is also called in the draft, which is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what's "principles"?
This was and is a matter of explanation, and it is to be feared that the Islamic will use the weak form and the existing legal space for a stricter explanation of the Scharia.
At least one new article is added: In all matters concerning the Scharia, the Al-Ashar University should be brought to the attention of the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiation in the entire Sunni Islam.
This must not be done, but it can mean that spirituality is the rule of law, which the fact would have led to the denial of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is a matter of explanation
Problem also: Civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
After the dictator's strike, up to 11,000 civilians were killed in military war.
The State should also, as it is in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their moral and values".
This is so legally formulated that state institutions can control the content of film and literature by means of this article.
In short, that doesn't mean anything else than a censor.
There is no other article that expressly describes the equality of men and women.
Another who forbids the prophets Mohammed and his envoys to policy or corrupt.
But what an insult and how it should be handled remains unclear.
Also, the wording must include the prohibition of "man's welfare".
Is there already a charity of the President or a white one at the expense of a lawyer?
The issue of explanation, as much as many in the draft, is presented to the Mursi for signature and, according to his words, will be presented to the Egyptians to vote for the people.
"The revolution has returned."
The opposition has been against the sovereignty of the Islamic people for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual entry on the freeway at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and agreed to bring the chart to pass, even before they could enter into force.
"The revolution is returned and we will see," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-party presidential electorate.
Mohammed El-Baradei, former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, declared that the Constitution was "on the Müllberg of History".
Via short-term justice service Twitter visited the subscribers Mursis, who wanted to lead a "Putsch against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and shoot him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, our brother's blood is still not well-satisfied," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organised Muslim frederity became a demonstration of the opposite, but apparently not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass-budget at the other Nilufer before Cairo University.
Many godly women and supporters took part and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Supplies the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A battle of the height over the symbolic Tahrir square, at which all its beginnings had taken place, would have challenged civil war powers.
The Mursis attachment did not appear to be at risk.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the Constitution and the sponsors had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamic people's projects are considered safe.
"The Word of Human Rights never comes before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would have had to go to February and join all the social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights officer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in or before the court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
In order to do so, he was sentenced, sentenced, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in the conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi Maghätänätängung on all three authorities in the state allowed the lawyer to re-sign the case.
These measures are ecstatic violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President puts it to the fact that it is beyond power," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological leadership struggle at the Nile with a mix of newer and splendour.
That could be a dream.

Rape from Norway: Is this the world's most famous fish?
The five million Norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and that is not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have anything to do with the local appetit on a fairly overwhelming fish?
You're taking a choice of over-expenditures.
You place them in the midst of a dark, cold sports dress.
And leave her there for a week.
This is how you have to imagine the fascinating smell of rakfish, one of Norway's great delicateities.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this heartbreaking noise in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfish is a salt-based forle that depends on how shrinking you would like to have its fish - until a year is fermented in water.
When the darkness over the country comes and the weather gets colder in Norway, Norway is looking forward to a festival here in Fägernes, which is now a truly vital specialty.
"It's cool and then it's filled with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firefight, but also acts as the so-called "Rakfish-General" festival.
In order to get us out of here, people will sell little fish and take a lot of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rockfish," Havard says.
Spirits can destroy the brain.
I bought some pills.
If you avoid bringing the fish near Nasen, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a right long bus ride behind.
Rakfish is the product of a completely different, much more expensive Norwegian era, when there were no cooling opportunities and fish was cut into the brain in air-drinked salvage.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after a long fermentation and, without a doubt, consumed with alcohol-depleted Sins.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to find work to leave their country and mainly to travel to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, surrounded by a flowering labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old Rivalen, who had not been far more rich than Norway, rich immigrants.
Rakfish is regarded as something more important - as an essential, although it is also a very rich part of Norwegian history.
He belongs to the terrible courts that can be bought here.
But in fact, everything is expensive here - a small glass beer or a sandwich costs a total of 10 euros.
Norway does not often create world pressure, and most people do not seem to destroy it.
Here we still have to call it Anders Breivik on behalf of those racist legal extremists, who were brought up by 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "The event of 22 July".
Norway is making it difficult to accept that someone in its peaceful country is capable of such brutal killings.
The growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has been largely responsible for the present richness of Norway since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it's so good for us," says Anna, our kellnerin, who distributes round tablets with rich rakfish and with its long-bred red hair and the rising blue eyes the northern ideal.
We are one - as it is said - people of insight.
Your English is just like most people here are free.
We're not very upset, we don't like jokes.
Norway has been very careful with its oil supply - a large part of the industry's revenue will be invested in a special fund for future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all the money they didn't own, Norway had to close its wallets.
"As long as we can ride in winter skis and travel in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, rakfish," she adds with unspoiled milk.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - I've had enough of rakfish.
So an Elk-cityer is in any case something else, the soft flesh can give me.
But in the evening, the fish is again on the food plan.
The hotel in which I log is one of several events that organises a rocket diver, with the guest for the best - or perhaps the noises are the most challenging - fish can vote.
There is a live TV movement to a showmaster dressed with wings, surrounded by tenters with rakfish.
The mirror looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
You laugh and laugh.
A man falls down from his chair, possibly overcome by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the tough cloud of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his mission, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges and mixed feelings of his people.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
Even in the best days, this is a always forgotten city, but on Monday a call was made from steel, which is hidden several important traffic routes in the capital and is provided on the streets for Chaos.
However, the objective was not to destroy Pendler on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential ties and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's in front of a complex task.
Under the different government, Felipe Calderons has managed to guarantee Mexico financially, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is very committed to reducing violence," explained Pena Nieto at the beginning of this week in Oval Office to US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he joined the U.S. President-in-Office, Pena Nieto was in charge of his home state of Mexico.
In this close, far-reaching part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions on the new state capital are shared.
A Direct Man
In the nearby small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you will be happy to remember him.
The residents of the holiday area write to him about the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the cars that built the Pena Nieto and represent a great improvement against the broken, narrow streets that it once had here.
Platelets with his name also depend on a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who serves as congressman for the Pena Nietos Party.
In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
After 12 years, the congressman Olvera said that the party was expecting Enrique Pena Nieto, outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The claim of the opposition, which the new president lacked in substance, is rejected.
He was a very direct man, very engaged and had great plans for the country.
He's a great stateman, especially he's also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the crowded streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The location is hidden under road transport and in many respects represents a city of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to fight drug gangs operating in the quarter, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a patch of Brachland near a large mille-deposia alone in the last two years, the bodies of thousands of dead women were left behind.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that the city of Ciudad Juarez itself has passed on, which is reported for their violence and the murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he has not dealt with the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the four that come down, Irenea Buendia fights with the trains when she shows me pictures of her lost daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events followed Mariana 2010 suicide.
But her family believes she was killed by her life-threatening.
"When I came home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was shot, and the body star had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is brought up beside a cross, which holds a single word: Justice.
But that's exactly what the family did. You've been lying to her since now.
The authorities have treated me as a nurse, a nurse, a nurse, a nurse.
They want you to simply accept your sentence and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many mistakes and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's pledge on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been admitted to membership in the last six years by violence, and the new President has promised to take care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope he is as President as he was governor," said the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza feared most.
The government has claimed: Bradley Manning has not complained about mistreatment
The government rejected Bradley Manning's claim that he had been imprisoned.
The hearing is with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks a derogation from the complaint due to the strict conditions of the case.
The release of the U.S. Army will require thousands of confidential documents to be used
On Friday, the U.S. government tried to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest spread of confidential information in the US history - failed several opportunities to complain about his alleged military abuse.
At a cruise officer Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month period in Quantico, Virginia did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cruise officer, who was detained on the basis of a request for defence to remove the complaint - if Manning had been punished enough by the hard-on-the-fifty period - Manning had said he would have raised the Swiss prisoner in prison.
The U.S. Army's secret serviceman, arrested in June 2010, is expected to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning passed through the forms that the officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his trial in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been subject to increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about the forms, Manning added that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, such as Fein, did not include complaints about mistreatment, although the officials had asked directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his thoughts orally and that the officials had spoken with him and indicated that they were to deal with him.
"They wrote (after discussing the thoughts) "No problems," and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything," says Manning.
The judge, Oberst Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee that should investigate the views mentioned by him a few months ago on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to allow his observation status to be reduced to "prevention of injuries".
The military said that it had given him this restrictive status - a level of suicide threat - to his own and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince my employees that I was going well, and I wanted to clear the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and sentenced to Kuwait, where he was arrested almost two months before he was transferred to the Marine Base Quantico prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he raised his own murder and was once unconscious because of the heat.
They must not know what happened to him or what happened to him in the outside world.
"My world broke down on Camp Arafjon, on this ship together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his day in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a matrice, a deck, flipp-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just to sleep.
He always had to sleep with light, which came out of his cell.
If he had turned around at night and could not see his face anymore, he would have woke him up so that he could turn back again.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally appealed against Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned a charge that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night in his cell in Quantico and had to stay in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning had said he had never had the chance to meet his cover during this story.
At the interview on Friday, Manning announced that he had concluded from an order of his guard that he should have fallen the deck with which he could have covered himself. However, he indicated that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep the night before. He had tried to show an officer that he did not pose a threat to himself.
Manning had told the officer that he could have used the band of his underhospitable or flops to hurt himself, but did not do so.
On this night, Manning said that his underhospitable, flipp-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take account of his port experience and will dramatically reduce his port level, he should be sentenced to trial before the military court. This is the beginning of the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be known to be less guilty, while other points of complaint considered to be too extreme should be considered.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this week. A legal remedy is expected from the government.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been established in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held in Quantico under the highest security conditions.
The charges against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found in all charges of guilt, he will be punished with a life-long sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame immigrants - they call them difficult times to remember, he says.
Navarret is the view that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a short trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had come to the pass check when there was a riot within me.
The pictures refer to two waiting languages: one for "Mexico" ("Mexico"), one for "Extranieros" ("Externals").
I was there for a few seconds, uncertain about what I should do with myself.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called "Mexicons."
A ethnic circle - exactly as my friends in Boston called "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italianer".
Later, I decided to "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for kürssels or binders.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to persuade me in this language at the end of a interview.
But I don't have a native speaker's vocabulary, and I'm not going to lose my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put me in the shoes for aliens.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda are all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason why Mexicans today, with the same high probability of staying in Mexico instead of moving away from the United States.
He wanted to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto is difficult to carry on the war against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resensitivity.
Most Americans may never have a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and that the country's leadership would be forced to leave more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, reminders of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official has only the quietest criticism of Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and under the elites of the country - complain about how Americans weigh the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the path of war.
However, Mexico's biggest challenge is in truth in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Lust, talk about resensitions?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people who offer the country opportunities, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree - maybe a parent or grandparent - no chance has come to Mexico and abroad in the north.
And in most cases, this person makes up a profile - dark, untrained, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our trust applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and get good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes wiped out, but what concerns our loyalty is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership are not interested in us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as the mouthpiece of a duplicating downstairs and look at us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
According to your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the shadow.
If our families hadn't been separated in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't have seen ourselves behind the coast now - with a nice life in the United States, but somehow lost something.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who was legally residing in the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take this to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are not to belong to another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you're not upset about it.
In Mexico we'll be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education community want to re-establish their links to diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "messenger" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press on political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
That won't happen.
To many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unencumbered corruption and drug habit, many of us are still not sure if it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through alone, Amigos.
That's great.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico over half a century ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are trying to raise a hole in how their family members have been treated for so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old-fashioned, new Middle East
The armed stand between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cause for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloodiest events seem to inspire such a hope in the chemistry.
In the midst of the regular school visits, there were money-free buildings in protection and ass, more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were killed by civilians and six Israelis, and for the first time rockets from Gaza were captured near the Israeli Metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, unknown situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these wars.
Maybe this will only lead to more blood loss.
However, there are reasons for believing that the fatal condition could finally find its end.
A war that won't be lost
At first glance, Optimism seems to have brought everything else in view of the current situation.
Even if the armed stand agreed on November 21st, these weekly wars have strengthened the hard-assists on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have forced Israel back, even though his group had to record very large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are admitted into one of the most isolated and densest parts of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas so far.
In fact, the Hamas will be added to West Jordan, which will be controlled by the rival, adjusted Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas have been able to draw strong and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a repressive regional power, which was first considered Israel's largest Muslim allies, has reached the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic golf states.
Young Hamas supporters believe that Israel constitutes an Islamic half-man - from Lebanon to the north, where the military has the power of Hisbollah, over Syria, where revolts of an increasing Islamic persecution may occur before the invasion of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies drag the king.
And in particular, the rise in Muslim fraternity under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most powerful and important Arab country with distance - in the southern part of Israel, has changed the balance of the region permanently.
Hosni Mubarak, the Lao Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his turn in 2011, had only a little time left for the Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on Volksian views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be expelled from Israel and the United States itself.
Israel’s hardliners will be able to draw an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly seen Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli rocket reconnaissance system, "Iron Dome", has been able to secure itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a long time Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
Diplomatically, the United States has consistently taken its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the most recent violence schemes.
Israel has been well achieved in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process for a large part.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicides - not the last thanks to the sporadic regimes that took place in the West Jordan and thus in the main part of a Palestinian state.
Netanyahu is well there. Its lykud party has joined the elections on January 22nd under Avigdor Lieberman with a more competitive group.
Why would these underground Palestinians also refuse and abandon their own state?
If they really had control over the West Jordan, wouldn't they not fire rockets just like their coroner in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should drive them to lift their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to pass through, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Muslims who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have left little for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defence seat is larger than its four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments in establishing their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi gathered with Barack Obama to achieve a position of armament could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israel too should think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking considerable steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to renew their self-determination rights - a powder phase that will undoubtedly explode one day in Israel's occupied areas, just as a bus in Tel Aviv this week explodes.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only intensify.
Blood missions to force Hamas back in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demanding their diplomatic trip over the years.
Both sides need an exception from outside
The correct answer is those represented by the most experienced representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and this journal: two countries in which Israel comes to security areas.
The - for the near future - is a small hope that the stand of arms will give out more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt now has to stop the arms delivery in the Gaza Strip together with Turkey and Qatar and is better placed than ever before to convince the Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the borders of 1967, supplemented by a regional exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to agree.
This would be more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the previous application to UN observer status.
And Obama must also contribute to moving Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to present his own plans for peace.
Far away in the white house, it seems that he would also have given up a participation.
But this is a sad, short-lived perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable approach to the east.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single packs of cigarettes
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs equivalent to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single packs of cigarettes and tobacco are in force in Australia. In this way branding logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive-green blankets, which are also printed with dramatic images, showing sick parts of the body and children affected by cigarette smoking.
From the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packagings in the names of the brands that are printed in identical, small letters is the following day.
Australia therefore introduces the world's strictest rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to rid young people of smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people who haven't started smoking with 26 are not going to start again with 99% probability.
"You can already see in children young adults that they understand the message of trying to hire tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. You invite studies that have shown for example that children have associated the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the world's lowest smoking rates and the changes will only affect the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already taking similar steps.
The Tababloby fought heart against the laws.
Thus, the black market trade would benefit from the legislation, which would lead to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will be taken seriously, lead to unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian Falschers are offering more and more of these products on Australia's streets.
Others say that the laws have broken her business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicon decolls to cover the unsubstantiated packagings has been gravely alarmed since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco companies broke up at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago with their enforcement of the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
Experts are therefore in favour of social media in the right group of the population to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have forced tobacco companies from TV advertising to appear as sports sponsors and forced most dealers to sell cigarettes in business no longer.
The Australian government has banned internet access by local companies and websites, but has no influence on international sites.
"If tobacco is marketed and has only a small area left to acquire its products, the Internet does not come back," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands that have been created by "anz normal people".
You have to ask yourself: Is it just a private person who finds such large cases of Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on marketing in order to distinguish itself from the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to implement the new regimes - those countries are complaining about unfair trade restrictions on the world trade organization, although no country is dealing with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
Plibersek has subsequently conducted talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to describe the photographic warnings.
In the meantime, these were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are being raised in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are still showing up.
The images don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"I just take a tip and pull the trigger away," says Victor El Hage, when buying a cigarette bottle, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, a tobacco trader "King of the Pack" in Sydney City, says that the single packaging has made it difficult to fulfill his rule.
"I used an hour ago to sort out a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government would just have to completely ban cigarettes - then we would have told us okay, that was, we'd close," he obviously added.
In a permanent electric world it's nice to be long enough even to be
I spent about five hours at the airport in this thank you, when our plane was crashing due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flightr.
So I had enough time to think about long-distance.
I don't want to lie.
A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course free free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and children's development experts lead long distances to something positive.
If it goes after them, it's for us - and our children - okay, it's sometimes slowing down.
In this way, the brain will be forced to lose its mind in interesting ways, which may contribute to creativity.
And because most of us today are almost always on one screen or another, the benefits of the long-term benefits will no longer apply to us.
So should we welcome the longevity with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be back.
Like many people, I have always learned that longevity is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing freedom.
However, Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Levely History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
"Of course the longevity has a very long history," he says.
The Pompeijis househouse boasts a Latin graphite over longways that goes back to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we actually define long distances.
John D. Eastwood, an Associated Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, follows the problem that long distances have been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that long-term people like the experience, "will want to pursue a satisfying work that can't be defined".
For a long time, Apethie differs depending on the fact that the person is not employed, but wants to be.
At the Apathy, there's no pressure to do something.
The key experience of the long-term advantage, he says, exists in a "distortion of the attention process, accompanied by bad wages and the feeling that time just goes away".
Long distances can be almost as much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two terms may be related, long-term people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are long-term, even if we have only difficulties, to concentrate on us.
In her study "The Unencumbered Mind: Defining Boreddom in Terms of Attention" - in Germany about: "The Infamous Meaning: The Definition of Longweil in the Aspect of Attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues showed on an earlier experiment in which a band was belonging to a person.
Some groups heard a popular television program from the nearby room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly realistic, while the third group did not take this noise at all.
The people who had hardly heard of the television offered more long distances than the two other groups - they had problems focusing on them, couldn't find any reason for it and write their difficulties on the long ones.
If you try to focus on a difficult or demanding task, you can lead to a long-term distraction of attention, says Mark J. Fenske, Associated professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you are engaged in an effective activity - "such as the search for wrong products on a manufacturer's band, music can relax and help you not feel inclined to feel it".
In fact, he says, we now know that hems and crystals, often interpreted as signs for longevity, can even fight by keeping people more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who can help around here can learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," said Professor Fenske.
We're all going to be a long time ago - my late flight, a breathing speaker, a particularly exciting film.
But some people take longer than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scaling for longevity".
On the scale are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys will become more long-term as girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at West Florida University - in particular, with regard to the need for more and a greater variety of foreign travel.
In general, however, teenagers are a very relaxed head.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community-based development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adults in the school and at the expense of household duties were slow, although 23% had to be slow if they were not in the school.
But only 3% of parents allowed themselves to feel excited.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages in terms of longevity were increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "the youth will be found especially slowly," mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily activities.
So back to my original question: Is Langeweile healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into the gambling or drugs to slow them down - which has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between longevity and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With the long-term help, the brain wants to say something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do just the best.
If one is long-term and one uses this energy to play guitars and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can provide short-term security for happiness, but they run long-term.
Anyone who reaches an iPad, however, may lose it from the long line. However, it has not been learned to maintain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, " Self-control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to maintain himself but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate longevity.
We should also not see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel well beyond the constant adjustment of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with him.
"It sounds as if we had to be longer. But longweil is the cool, unfading desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to stop and relax.
"In a environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with if the noise is once understood."
In Colorado there is no clear guidance for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the south of Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana breakers and a pfee that he smoked.
Orozco followed him and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer Marihuana was found in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drugs - rivals who were sentenced to a fine of $100 - and received a court term.
"We're going to be treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But he's also one?
In the weeks following the state's decision to legislate small amounts of Marihuana for self-use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug addicts depends less on the law than on the place.
Hundreds of orders that are moving around Marihuana are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities will no longer follow adults over 21 years of age for property in small amounts. This will be legally allowed as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But state officials in the conservative regions of Colorado have announced that existing marijuana dealers continue to follow and still quote people before the court.
At the same time, several cities agree to prevent new, state-licensed Marihuana business from opening up in their communities from the Danish cities to the Western Mountains.
"This situation develops so fast that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, who is east of Denver.
And the regulatory authorities in Washington, Germany, have fallen suddenly at the head.
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, production, sale and sale of drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington it is considered that Colorado is, in any case, ahead of most states, the regulation of Marihuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market. Therefore, the state is well-oriented," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the watch office for Spiritists in Washington State.
But Smith also says that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a grave guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, is in force on 6 December and thus constitutes the end of a grant which, although not yet existing in the state licence system, has been legalized.
And unfavourable practical questions need to be clarified at this time - such as the State standard of "adjusted access" to Marihuana, with the ban on cannabis business around 300 metres for schools, parks, playplaces and child care facilities.
"Nowhere it will be harder to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Baltic Seattle area," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently-trained research group.
On November 21th, Chief Oates sent his staff to Aurora an e-mail in which he declared that the government's lawyer would not follow smaller marijuana dealers in people more than 21 years ago, and that the police would not want any criminal evidence for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban standards to regulate the growth of medical marijuana and will continue to be followed by drug dealers.
In the World County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck gives a more strict view of the region's state of affairs.
After the vote, he said that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 persons have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less Marihuana before the court, although many have also been charged for other offenses.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue losses at the time of the execution," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are itself at places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the countryside, does not show adults who have smaller numbers.
The District Court, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to allow all outstanding possession procedures to fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time to exercise the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measures, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the negative reactions throughout the state have encouraged local officials to take a deep interest in the great green experiment for days.
In the region, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a law-enforcement lawyer from Denver, who is accused of Marihuanadelikte in court and acts as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of Marihuana.
"They have spent a large part of their life in order to prosecute people for not yet being able to accept legalization," he says.
As the first countries to deal with the smaller amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national samples for the legalization of drugs.
While interviewers and state officials were preparing for a temporary legal sale, they were also nervous about the instructions of the federal government, who wanted to continue to treat the sale and construction of Marihuana at the federal level as a penalty.
Speakers of the legislative movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be followed.
Despite more visible arrests by consumers and medical sales of Marihuanas, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries to be large.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug-political brother of the Obama government, is the view that criminal officials are likely not to enter the door to challenge the smaller amounts of drugs, but perhaps they are going to be involved, which are legal, state-run marijuana business under the new legislation.
A number of cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new Marihuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a town in the west, decided a six-month ban, probably the next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level in front of a big problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city court.
Our Community has voted against this amendment.
We refer to what the Community has decided and not what the State has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was moved from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today's university students are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I held first for the world's largest scientific model, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great goals of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into the Worscester College at the end of the eighth year - there I had been going to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus filled the first scandal of my life.
My father brought in trains together.
My friends were wrong.
In Evening Standard it seemed that I would have gone because I had a problem with commilitones in the nearby room having sex.
The author A N Wilson kindly explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less amusing.
I love it.
Yes, dear, because I'm a little under systematic mobbing and smoking.
Not because of my real unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
It was only for one reason that I was shocked - a reason that in this apparent direction of enlightenment seemed so narrower and more harsh: My dying father, Woodrow Wyatt, was an important consultant Margaret Thatchers, and I was the sponsor of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, current reports lead to a new generation of students of qualified rights under similar persecution.
The organised and rising hass on Tory students in Oxford have developed in the meantime such dimensions that a group of them in the last week asked for equal rights, education, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College are given, because of their political views, they will "be actively isolated, personally arrested and declared as ill-willed".
They ask for a place in the Equalisation Committee of their College to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Her situation was damaged by a recently published documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories were represented as Excentrians and Neonazis.
This was shown by the former President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who went to a Rolls-Royce, with a silver-coloured approach and silver-stained gohstock.
Conservative students at other universities say they will be regarded as "sinbooks for the introduction of higher studies".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing link to universities.
People believe we are like the Bullingdon Club, without having any knowledge of us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unacceptable". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said that she had observed a growing ban on students of the right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I heard such a minority.
As an incredible 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The Hass on the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the past year, the university had agreed to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - no honor due to cuts in college.
The atmosphere would have even caused the Stalinists to panic.
In the first days of the first semester, when the new students and the tutors met, I received a preview of the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutors not only taught the imagination of Tory students, but also shared with joy.
Political issues such as mountain work, privatization and abolition of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the forested areas of the Tutorium.
In my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said the Tutor Harry Pitt, "Please replace the first paragraph."
I'm proud of you.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a kitchenette, and very comfortable.
"Do you hesitate to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were watching.
In my eyes, the trains came up.
"I suggest that they take a few hours in French at your time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt said.
I went back to my room with a hanger head.
That night I was in college alone on the evening when someone pointed me easy on the shoulders.
It was a second-year English student named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone who suspects to be Tory will be strangled.
It's bad enough for me, but she knows that your father, Margaret Thatcher, is going to be worse for you.
The majority of Tory-First Masters suggest being attached to the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to seduce myself.
I realized I wasn't in all the points with Mrs. Thatcher of a point of view.
This trick should prove to be successful.
A student in the philosophy, politics and economy, who had literally visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist witch."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perversity and drunk.
"How's Tories Sex?" asked one.
They're fighting each other, aren't they?
I felt the need for homosexuals to have felt before the liberality of the United States.
Would I be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be equal only after the outbreak of darkness?
Should I use the labor party and suppress my natural distress?
The three years that were ahead of me turned out to be a fire of care and isolation in front of my spiritual eyes.
The only Tutor to recognize himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
Not only did he insist on being a conservative, but also because he consulted Thatcher in foreign policy matters and had written for them.
He was just rare here.
He liked the place, found him provincially and small-scale and taught him about his Marxist-Determinist history perspective.
In 1997, he joined a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started to rock between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with close friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
All political views were accepted during his time in the quarter.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said slightly.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of dreaming turms.
Even my Communist friends always put uneven handles on the day.
His hot eyes were shaking.
Give the glove a chance.
I'm sure you don't want to.
It would break my heart if you went.
Created by my frequent journeys to London, my emotional resistance has weakened.
One of my men's friends, including Tory-Angager, had followed the pressure and challenged his beliefs.
During a Tutorium next week, in which another historian seriously claimed, I was "a enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly hiding in front of Scham, I added that my parents had taught me a "grandmother" and called her "old trottel".
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who killed the last needle in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my horses came up.
When they left, I packed a box and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Gerne, you can call me a vengeful sleep disorder.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in a education institution under such harassment and unemployment.
And it's even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university, not only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is still hiding behind an invaluable call of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino presents the elegance of fame."
Based on the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemmaker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the UK capital, which is worthy of the restoration of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 skin Couture clothes were assembled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his irrevocable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "the Signor" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always been fascinated by fascination for the harsh and distant world of the Adel.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3rd, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the last aristocracy, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the famous fashionmaker in Voghera city in northern Italy to the idol of the international set.
In the adel he's in love, he doesn't have to be of a nature.
"At least they don't wear their hats on your beautiful carpet, as it does some beautiful performances from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, large-scale and elegant guest.
"We all rejoice when we are invited to his house in Gstad," explains the exfrau of "Heini" Thyssen, a friend of forgotten beauty, such as Marella Agnellli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always proposed the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the modemmaker.
Many years ago we went to him after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he recognized his influence.
"All the guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began their course in Paris during the autumn of the 1995 Haute Couture.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Modern View of the Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of vengefulness, rather than of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the gallerys in Somerset House was converted into a glorious and 60-metre walkway, which suggests a role change: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the path to admire a dreamful "audience" that holds Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a dress of wool and leather belonging to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this publication, names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mete-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg are deleted.
Naty Abascal and the Modemmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgetable".
I can still remember myself perfectly.
It was a house, a building, a west type "Gillette" and a jacket from the Herbst/Winter Collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museum.
"I draw him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he prefers our beauty," adds the ex-hero of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and lower the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and head of opinion at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she took a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of having finally the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to this end.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the close of my vet, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a painted office with a decolleté that makes his name honored.
"It was a real dream," says the White of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy, living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashionmaker's night clothes "with absolute care," because a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories."
The King of Mode
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Cantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modemmaker called his neighbors) were necessary in order to adjust this elephant-colored silk garment with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four-half-metre-long sweater.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the Elite's "savour-étre", Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest designation of Italians), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, is distinguished by the honour, and Garavani has accumulated as much honor as any of its customers.
"I have always suffered from its refining, its peace, its impregnable and perfect outside," says D'Arenberg.
I've seen him the last time a month ago at a Gala-Abendasses in the museum de Orsay.
He's at the table of the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was free; the time left no trace on him."
And that says a princess...
The world's toughest profession: the human working hours of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the people of the Indonesian volcano play their lives and their health when they take 70 kilos of bicycles across the steep, rocky roads.
There are people for whose work is hell, and others do meaningful work in hell.
This is the case with Anton Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking the shoes from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
In addition, every day he has to climb down the floor of his crater, where the excellent liquid gas from the earth is heated in contact with the air.
After breaking out of large snowflakes that can reach up to 70 kilos, he transports them in two drums on his shoulders over the steep road from stone.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises up to a height of 2386 meters, but the created trees need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the sky at the time, where they have to maintain the same weight and carefully set their steps so that they do not break and break.
You know that every step can cost your life, as did a French tourist who stopped at Kawah Ijen's railways years ago.
The Mining Workers of Kawah Ijen deserve 5 Euro cents for each Kilo Swefle that they build.
They come up, they cross the road between the tourists who photograph them like circuses and walk with the rising heavy bodies three kilometers to the road, which a mining company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Grimbi, which has been using the presence in Vulkan since 1960 and (not to say better) its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rubies (5 Eurocent) for each Kilo Swefle.
It then sells for every 10,000 rubies (€83 cent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is spread daily and is used for the manufacture of raw oils, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each way," explains Anton, who normally makes three tracks a day.
For each segment, he needs three hours for which he has been fully created, but at the end of the day, he has collected 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable reward for such a terrible inhuman effort, but it's the threefold of what he would deserve with the field work.
"The wage of the mine workers here, where 15 000 rubies are paid per day (1.2 euros) and the average monthly income is two million rubies (167 euros), is very high," explains the driver who worked as a maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, and for one reason that is as important as the swish in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has Asthma, with difficulty, frequented, and his eyes are turned away because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing in Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sweat has already left him the first track, even though he covered his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has Asthma, carried with difficulty, frequented and his eyes are moved from the volcano because of the toxic gas.
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dreams.
"I'll work here for two more years, because I want to create a load or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathical and intelligent but experienced young man could work as a tour guide, coach, or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he is doing the work of a trafficker.
He shares a dirty wooden coat with other tractors and stands up every morning about two hours, because the sweater also shines at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines in the dark.
The shadow challenges him in the light of a small star lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
About 400 prisoners loaded the bodies with shoes on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not enabled the shipping plant to save costs, and provides the tenants who work on their own account and pay for weight, no equipment.
They also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) Addition per photo equipment, which the farmers of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) require tourists to photograph the volcano and the human traffic.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protests Madrusin, a stubborn 42-year-old prisoner who has been working for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and ensures that he continues, "soon it goes", because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to get paid, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the swivel burns the keel and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners into the thick shells that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the normal respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the bones and joints on the shoulders that have formed themselves from the weight of the body.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years of age.
Each day, he and his men break 15 tons of garbage from the volcano, which are transported by three LKWs across a bridge between the book to the camp in Tamanzari in 18 kilometers away.
"I won't go to interest, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth far, in which some teeth are missing.
From his five children, the elder also works as a shoedresser with his 30-year-olds.
The time goes by, but poverty keeps generation in one of the world's deepest professions: those who work as a human burden at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans owe it to them not to have children, on careers, stress and the costs of real estate and child training.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife: We fulfill our obligation to our citizens and we create life!
It seems incredible that the Verse are part of a release for Minzbonbons, but still - or just because - they started this year in Singapore to be a virtual video on YouTube.
The sets are part of a rapper song, the local speech, such as "Schieben will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make yourself fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has driven the video, is the hope that the advertising pot will be achieved in a funny way to focus on the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people in to fulfill their "national obligation."
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to design it funny and intelligently.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when we move on, so we noticed that it is about a subject that we have to care about.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organisation of speed dating apples (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to solve this problem, like a rap?
1,2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue lightly is the Government of Singapore.
Each year it spends $1,300 on political measures to attract more children.
A package of the government for couples and parents is provided up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything was so far less successful.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservationism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1,2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeers get children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director for Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says this will lead to a "better education" and greater career opportunities.
"This has enabled people to have more options with regard to goals of life, apart from marriage and the formation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of unmarried and pregnant women and children, resulting in reduced birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in migrations in order to prevent the reduction of the population resulted in resensitivity among the local people.
In Singapore, there are websites where the almost hidden xenophobic is flowering against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration will also be seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore has achieved its worst election since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and duties for foreign workers.
Unexpected follow-up
While the decline rate of births has the known effects on the growth of a nation's economy, taxes, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not many small dwellings are built.
It already has effects on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to check the number of small apartments known as "Schools" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great success in selling.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life-style of the single parent, and that they discourage the construction companies from building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "smokers" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are as popular, and the units are sold every day and even weeks faster than the largest housing units.
This means they're much better for our Cash Flow.
However, it adds that the new standards give the developers a clearer orientation, which were previously placed in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could help prepare the way for an increase in the national rate of birth, the discussions with Singaporeans working in the financial sector are to conclude that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very depressed, the apartments and the education are expensive, so it's taken out by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get other.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and costs for property and education as a reason for not having children.
That is why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can do so much more.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is about the property of private or "some area of privacy where you claim to be protected from any kind of immigration".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its daily and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses if he makes himself known on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people between 10 and 15 years of age who are often on the network.
In four cases they linked the concept with "something very personal" at personal level and "on the password and user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be known in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been in accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games high.
I also spend my time with strangers.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't from me, or from someone who makes the dumb head," he says.
The young man is aware that it is wrong to publish photos of naked people, or to write misleading or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are connected.
Among other things, the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I called on Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just letting her up," he adds.
"The social networks are consistent, I can quickly talk to relatives on the outside or with friends," he says.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone offered him a neighbor, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In order to avoid knowing 20 of the people he placed on his buddy list.
"This doesn't bother me because we have something together, for example, music," he says.
After the boy had been informed, no one had made an announcement to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone weighs me or demands me, I simply remove him from my user account," he says.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boys are not unknown experiences known today as cyberbullying.
The reputation of a friend was expressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to secure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, these young photos of strangers would be loaded up in unbelievably or painful situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic or I'd like to tell him something.
"But I know this is cyberbulling," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with high-school education and learning, believes that to focus on children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of play have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master title in Pádagogik at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
The digital Natives are they, the children and young people who are raised with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are going to teach them, where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject, "because we want them to have a defined criterion on what to spread, publish or say, and this in an age where the range is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective if they are the most important ones, to be liked to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what is privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to mind.
"Tell them they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras next calls for some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would it happen to you if you published a photo of you, like what you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labelled photos of holidays?
And one more question: Do all need to know what you're talking about at any time?
Another point is to let them understand that they must act online as they do it online.
It's the same rules.
"Some people outside the Internet deal with respect, visibility and other principles, and that must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Esturado Guardia, University professor, primary school teacher and educator, comments that it is impossible for parents to read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid grounds to discuss with their children the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unashur Summit without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) today ended in Peru without publication of the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and signed theoretically by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI. The official meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially shared that they would pass it on the clause, but then declared that it would be published for some time on the Peruvian Government's website.
On the subject of the text, they pointed out that the content of the president of Peru, Olanta Humala, was presented to the press in short statements.
The access of journalists to information on the event was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the President's meeting was transmitted in the press area without a tone with the announcement "private sitting, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers from some of the governments of the Unashur who were present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speakers.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which was reviewed by the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media unaccompanied, who requested more information.
The President of Peru then sent an e-mail to the media with the "closed statement" of the summit, but it was about the explanation of Humala and not about the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the III Gippel of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, the press had published the so-called Declaration of Lima, which had previously been announced, as well as less published.
On the official website of ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published on the last service day.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems existed for journalists, but in a high degree limited access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of the Hague which deals with a cross-border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH that began on Monday in the Hague, in the process that led the Lima against Santiago to listen to the plaindoyers on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we now make with this International Court of Justice," said Humala, together with his Chilean opponent.
"Cile was, is, and remains a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and underpins the international courts," Piñera adds, adding a big Humala with a hand print in front of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would submit themselves to the IGH was successful following a decision by Colombia on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which was a serious error, raised a complaint against the Bogotá agreement, in which it agreed to challenge the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present at the summits.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Union since the adoption of his President Fernando Lugo since 2011, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president Olanta Humala opened the morning talks and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The State Head of State issued the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set at a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
To the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unashur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decision on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and the organised country-wide crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to work together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) cannot accept triumping trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future," adds Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and create new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a statement.
Among these projects, there were also five Peruvian people who placed on the querachs of his coast to Brazil, two of which were to provide a better connection to Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
It also adopted the final document on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the elections in this country will be held in the Union of South American nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meetings, that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected to meet with his opposition from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal with the maritime conflict in a manner that was considered by Bogotá in question by the IGH.
"Maybe I will meet President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Samsday)," said Santos.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua requires conversations with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and as respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Minister for Defence of the Block for the Adoption of the Action Plan for 2013, which should strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even though the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America needs to learn about the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has today confirmed that the creation of a common state citizenship is a goal, in which "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, explained that the state television in Peru "in the second world war and in other fashions" and "in practice today are a father country".
In this regard, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship which the Member States of the Union are proposing.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as it is already in the Andean community, must be achieved; however, there are still more reactive sectors that want to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also authorized the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) in order to reduce the influence of English States and to take into account those signed by San José on human rights.
Those who teach are never obliged to do anything, and in this respect we are always signing up to the South Americans.
"It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is funded by the United States," he explained as a reflection of political asylum, which Ecuador has given the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not abandoned his principles, but had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that in his time it had "founded suspicions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be carried out."
He also criticised the Swedish justice he had requested to appoint him in his territory because of a alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legal speech allows this through a video conference that would have been implemented by Ecuador's message in London."
Correa explained that the risk was that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he's in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the messenger has informed me that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but not a difficult one," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
However, there is a risk that he will experience physical and mental damage because he has been caught in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises in the open.
"That would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum, the Assange has been granted since June in the message of Ecuador in London, is the provision of a license to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the British, Swedish and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that it had been given to London to find a solution for the reasons set up by WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not apply this word to this case, however, it has given constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the attorney of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures at various European institutions," he explained.
And "if the United Kingdom gives this letter tomorrow, this is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden Mr. Assange listened to Ecuador's message in London or over Skype, how it was allowed to speak Swedish law and in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa used the opportunity to prove herself a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate, "the media equality, the evil intentions and the lies that the free opinion expressed."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and pervert politicians, but evil journalists who seek and express themselves," he said.
In this sense, he was pleased that Ecuador would no longer be ruled by such journalists "and not be controlled by the banks or hegemonic and pitiable countries," and he assumed that in a resurgence, "the revolution would be extended to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in the Unashur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization "should remain and no opportunism and no state power should be imposed as a legally clothed country", because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also welcomes the desire of his Colombian opponents, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which the maritime government of Nicaragua has favored to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, for "absolutely entitled."
This judgment shall not be implemented at the present time.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a common way in the pursuit.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look ahead.
He also expressed his confidence in a good conclusion of the disputes between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "what is right for Latin America is to call international authorities, if both countries are obliged to accept the judgment, even if it feels very strongly."
With regard to the possibility that he was a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate, he indicated that he "sees this opportunity with great optimism and joy, even though it sometimes seems very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never personally interested me, but under such unjust conditions as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this possible victory, so I have to take this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I'll get back from public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also took into account the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had gone there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would expect to travel to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a return to the health status of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a death due to AIDS today is a late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the study results: HIV positive.
"It was like if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "fuck up" without noticeable success.
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) in which he came after several wars in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time it itself prevented the director of an IMSS clinic from adopting itself, "because it led to a sack gas."
That was AIDS Synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know anything about their disease, where the virus has already caused damage and has created its immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes the treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG leader Jaime Andrade Villanueva, in which he said that this information was supported by a scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that scientists have concluded since 2008 that AIDS is not a cause of death, but that the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the level of the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that there have been greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years in a number of 200 CDs4 and 50 years in a number of 500 CDs4.
Simply stated, the above statements mean that those who get HIV positive at the age of 25 can be "problemly 75 years, as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to make this progress correctly, it must be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report)) it is still true that 60 per cent of patients diagnosed in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people die in 2011 alone, and by May this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it will be ensured that there has been universal access to anti-retroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die from it?
- I believe that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's my opinion, and that's how it's in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no problems with the medications. The problem is that people are in a long-term state because they do not know their infection condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He says: "Nine of ten patients come to us when they already have a concomitant infection. In order to affect the global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, so that all people who need it must be offered a mass test."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officials of the Council Statal de Prevenção del Sida en Jalisco (Coisco) (State Committee for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and also with the patients like Fabrizio, who conducted their tests at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that he had made a friend who, despite his young age, had already been in the AIDS phase and had even the kaposi sarkom (a cancer tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then I'd rather put three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, drive sport and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I work a lot, I have an active but responsible sex, I look at my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILLENIO JALISCO in order to animated with his witness those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS Day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. They should know before they are HIV positive, better than that, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how you can live responsible as everyone else.
Its message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the cargo
There are great gaps between health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places, "the distribution of condoms is actually increased; they were given separately, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need?" is an extensive survey of social workers, orientation staff in schools, apotheques employees and the health system that young people do not want to replace, the correspondent assured.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be re-oriented; the condoms should be located not only behind the cargo, but in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted by promiscuousness.
They should not be paid the beer and furniture as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether Preservative would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexality doesn't look like that; best of all, it's to bring the condoms closer to those who already have sexual activity," he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is nationally seen in the 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of seizures occur through sexual transport, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know about each registered case.
After the U.S. court has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the responsibilities of the Vitro Group, which has been reached through a trade competition in Mexico, an ineligible pre-trial case for each national undertaking with its subsidiaries in the neighbouring country has created the problem of payment.
Thus, it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies which allow Mexican laws do not have validity in the country of the stars and stripes in opposition to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court in Bancarrots for the northern district of Texas is that the Mexican companies are exempt from the decision of their property outside the Bravo river.
However, the decision opens up the largest lighting manufacturer in Mexico Door and Tower to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the believers must submit to the United States competition law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit with a seat in New Orleans states that it is in the main proceedings for the trade contest in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in procedures for the payment capacity of companies with a country-wide profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the Union of International Trade Law, where the American Law Institute was used as a lighter.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the commitments in the competitive mass that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not be reached for the restructuring of the bonds.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Group of the Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (the Federal Institute for Trade Competition).
It is also true that, after the vote of the branches, the believers of Vitro, who complained against the United States courts against Vitro, did not reach a majority of the gas funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Employment Court.
On the other hand, Vitro owes for his difficult situation since 2008 in the United States, in the context of the major economic crisis that spread to the country.
For this reason, the Gonzalez Sada family argues before the same Court of Appeal in order to make the vote in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If not provided, the Cerciorare case shall be lodged, which requires the examination of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The gravity of this case is that the court issued a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figure amicus curiae (Freund of the Court), which describes the procedures carried out by Vitro under the Law on Trade Competition, and which indicates that it was strictly bound to the agreements signed by the two countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Law.
In addition, it will be pointed out that the country has violated the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules laid down for cases of cross-border payment capacity that guarantee equal treatment of debt and creditors.
Double carambole: a sword for Vitro and for the country.
General's Patience
After the announcements by Mexican air carriers against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is charged with an anti-fraud administration, the Association Sindical de Pilotos Aviados (the pilots' trade association) has finally made progress.
The search by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morneau has now submitted a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which will be called for to prevent justice.
The supervisory authority has then systematically refused to inform the principal administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by an entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the Bank IXE trust account F/589 million pesos on behalf of Mexicoan de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrative Professional de Hotels (professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main activation of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental defenders, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to reverse the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak from a huge shopping and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, supplementing a living area for the staff of 150 companies.
In the meantime, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) has managed to unite the Governors in the south in order to resist the monumental institution that destroyed the protected areas and represented the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is up to
Because the government of a Senate request to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known as the ACTA Abbreviation, the case has already been recorded according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were carried out, although the Senate had taken the opportunity to take account of them, because it considered them to be a fraud against freedom of opinion in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings more than 500 million pesos to the market.
The issue is the first of four equal emissions that a loan is promised every 28 days.
Based on Competival
Trained by NYCE, e-Quality and Corenet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose purpose is to serve the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bomber of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been connected to corps for more than 60 years and has prepared the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the basketball ball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether it was a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, full-time and leader of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball league.
"I have built a lot of houses in basketball, even several times at the same time as I was President of the BSN, Head of the National Company and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he and Isabel, his faithful wife, had been living for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and are attached to them.
Bayamón and Hearts
The most emotional memories are those who, in his time, remember Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year-old anniversary as a business leader or business leader of the club.
"That was my best years, which I have enjoyed most, because I have been part of eight Masters of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether it was a business leader, a business leader or a coach.
There were many satisfying years, including the five masters from 1971 to 1975.
And then I married a Mastership 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's Debt at BSN.
Since then, "Cuco" has taken over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," Reyes says.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was appointed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommends the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best sellers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had made a mastership for Bayamon, Gauss would have taken care of another one.
The mastership of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but he was already out of the distance because he was already at the top of the relationship in 1988.
At this time, he was about to enjoy his full efforts and those of Mincy in the National Mission.
I still know when we first won the U.S. in the preolympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, in which we claimed the fourth place, which would actually have been bronze, if it had not been this Canadian lawyer who allowed us to resume our last game for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the World Mastership 1990 was the best National Mission you've ever seen?
It belongs to the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
However, my favorite is the man of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and fought the US team, as they fought against us at the Bronze World Championship.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who were unable to be there for 1990 because of a breakup.
A man who may not have been the best in his personality, with whom we won a gold medal and who prepared us for great joy, was one of the preolympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitner as replacement for the disabled players because of the advantages of the Spanish games in Mar del Plata, we win against every forecast the gold medal.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers are impressive at the level of international tournaments.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculin.
And that he may take account of his conduct in the various ways in which he was playing.
Who was the best trainer in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julia Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys, I like Leo Ariel's work.
What do you think is the best you've got in the relationship?
I was part of the most successful Åra of the National Mission from 1988 to 1995, covering the BSN from the 1990s to 17 in one season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalisation of the sub-categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and meet people from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the results of prescribed training and courses for trainers, desk officers and counsellors.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my single children and get off and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoyed my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman's up.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was known worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a homeless, domestic and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oilmagnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the 80s Habgier.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. to a new stage of "Dallas", died on Wednesday due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., manufacturer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once played the iconic role that most of him liked," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the funeral.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He did all the joys he could.
He was creative, great, funny, wise, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life in full train," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a bad tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years prior to "Dallas" Hagman was known on television as a net type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the seat "Bezaubernde Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the Astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life was put on his head when he encountered an attractive "Dschin" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also the founder of two comedys that were only recently released, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema work included well-valued roles in "The Group", "Harry and Toto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the so-called obscenity of J.R., which made the Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS television series on the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its environment were released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The claim "Who did it to J.R.?", which should create the expectation for an episode of full emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were put into houses.
This led to the series reaching a observer record at the same time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million visitors, who translated "Dallas" into the second most popular maintenance program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million visitors.
It was Kristin, who had shot the Swiss of J.R. (translated by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had made her tired and sad to see her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but there were other reasons for wanting to see her.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insubstantial man with a charismatic body: a permanent businessman and an underprivileged husband who then tried to introduce his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to do on J.R.'s gravestone," said Hagman in 1988.
It's supposed to mean "Here's the famous citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, founder of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as a "great personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unstinting for millions of victims in the world and keeps us happy to know him and to love him, to receive him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success in the TNT channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second column was completed, and a sixth chapter was just delivered, the sender informed.
From Warner or TNT, there was no immediate explanation as to how Hagmann’s loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actor and singer Mary Martin, the classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she met Larry during her marriage with the law firm Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theaters in New York in the early 1950s, and then he served in the air force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he learned about the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time, where many famous people lived.
In 2001 he wrote his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Number (and Absolute Truth) Tales about my Life".
"I haven't written anything from which I thought it might harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press in his time.
After liver transplantation, he worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help prisoners.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet them when they perform their operations and then," he explained 1996.
I want to give them some trust, like "no fear, it's a little awkward for the first time, but it's going to be good for you."
He also took part in several campaigns against smoking.
Start of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an undisputed angel: the end of the Maya calendar's "long return count" on December 21, by many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should be expected of him in the next two months: the destructive Hurrikan Sandy, who called some as "Deudarmagedon", as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place where Christian theorists believed that the Apocalypse began.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever happened," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers Campden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzed what is happening in the world today, if we were to be away for thirty days, that would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who should be the last in history to offer a course on "the end of the world".
In the temple, Professor Barry Vacker has the course "Media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way and how hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compared themselves with the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, believed and impossible," said Vacker.
At the principal campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, formed a team with a leading professor for art history and anthropology to offer a course with the bad name "The End of the World".
"We do not take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option to stop the course again for the fact that the world doesn't fall apart," said Restall.
In spite of the "prevention" the students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State the final examination will be carried out prior to the apocalypse, so the students have no chance to continue working until night, where the world is likely to end," said Restal.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for students with a high average who filled with 35 students.
A week before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if they were still free.
The students will ensure that the course is of interest to the students.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camps for Religion and Soziology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religionism is actually just a question of trust or failure.
The 25-year-old student Will Weekesa for Psychology and Disease Care explains to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I haven't heard anything from a teacher where this is taught," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students asked - and less than one professor - said to believe on the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in certain ways we discretion it," said Julie Zeglen, a student in temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never said before the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is a apocalyptic fear that brings back several centuries when people have responded to changes in their environment with the prospect of the end of the world.
The Internet has raised these speculations.
"People don't think otherwise," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Hall, who teaches this year to the Philippines, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines don't participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an emphasis on an exception to a higher instance.
We have a petition from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been discussed by the Court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people immediately think of a new date" or that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period, the end of the world is coming.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world."
"Maybe I call a couple of friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
