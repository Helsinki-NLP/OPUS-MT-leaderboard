Members of the Gales National Assembly received "pass by Mars"
There is confusion by some Members of the Gales Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title should be amended to MWP (Parliament of Gales).
The origin of this controversy is in plans to change the name of the assembly for "Parliament Galès".
Some members of this assembly, coming from all political colors, felt that this would make them fall into the fold.
A AM worker said that the group is concerned about the fact that "the appointment ends with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Gales readers: in the Galesa language, "twp" means "idiota" and pwp means "excrements".
A Plaid's AM said that the group in its globalization "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A Polish conservative said that the group was "open" with regard to the change in the name, but pointed out that the MWP designation was probably very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Gales has a statement similar to the letter from Yorkshire or non-English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drawing up legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on the way Members of the House are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave its Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which registered a generalised support for the proposal to designate the Assembly by the Galès Parliament.
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission favoured "Members of the Galès Parliament", or the WMP, but the MWP option was more favourable in public consultation.
The US are apparently proposing alternatives, but the effort to bring the consensus together can be a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as the rules on the disqualification of the AM and the setting up of the system of committees.
When they discuss legislation, the AM will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonia will refer to the change in the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change in their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with the neighbor Greece, which integrated a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has strongly insisted that the name of its neighbor in the north is a claim on its territory, repeatedly contradicting its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposition from the Plenary on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is no more than the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's Synos wakes up at a time when the churches of Harlem struggle for survival
"No historical perspective, the old ones I talked to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one else."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently" today, he said.
"The bars stopped being the rooms of being out of the neighborhood where people are heading regularly."
With regard to the churches, worry about the possibility of money gain with the sale of patriarchal property not as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the starting point."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by a preview of apartments with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the saints in the village who still remain.
"The majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, will appreciate the arrival of the day when these churches will all be closed, because it is unlikely that most of those who change to these complexs will join those congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation came out of here in the 1930s.
The building was then forced by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate areas.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverendo John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the lojiers of 125th Street, an important commercial street in Harlem that opposed the recruitment and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they planned for their reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carilion.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the "the sons of the poor."
The specialist who touched the carilion in July called it another thing: "a cultural treasure" and an "insubstantiable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the world's first career to be played by a black music, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the biggest career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace it.
What happened in St. Martin's last few months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some drawn by the church’s lay leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish consisting of the leaders of the parish, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "proceeded to reimburse its costs" was bad because it had not been involved in the contracting of the architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tubaron causes injuries in a 13-year-old adolescent in a dog-to-lagosto in California
A mob attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on the Sabbath during a hunting break in August in California, on the first day of the summer season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel declared to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been walking with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy scream for help, then moved in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for having caught a lake, but then it became evident that the boy screamed "I'm dead!"!
I was murdered!
The whole area of the keyboard was dilated, Hammel described what he noticed when he arrived at the boy.
"I called everyone to get out of the water: "There's a tube in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical state.
The type of tuberculosis responsible for the attack is unknown.
The surviving Captain Larry Giles stated in a communication to the press that a tube had been warned in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was not considered to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the throne.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation purposes and for security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of tuberculosis in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plan to enter the UK cosmetic market
The Sansbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of the large weapons, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain quota on the United Kingdom cosmetic market, estimated at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothing and articles for the country collect, these larger cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores scattered by the country and will be implemented in more stores in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This cosmetic investment stems from the search, by supermarkets, in ways to use another exposure space used for TVs, micro-waves and articles to read.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalogue of beauty products with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to those of the Boats.
The supermarket network is also relaxing its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products obey vegan precess, something more often required by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume store The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London last week. It is expected that the second, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, will open at the end of the year.
Online purchases and the change of food habits for small quantities daily in nearby stores led supermarkets to now have to work more to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Saninsbury's, said that the stores are increasingly like large stores, while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has come to install sales points Argos in hundreds of stores, has also installed a series of Habitats, since he acquired both chains two years ago, and says that this strengthened sales of merchandise and made the most profitable purchases.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sanisbury's tested a partnership with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference in the distribution of revenues from the health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saninsbury's has sold its pharmaceutical business for three years with 281 sales points to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Saninsbury's, said: "We transform the aspect and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, which will be available to advise the customer.
Our brand range has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistibility point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "free" after Holly Willoughby has left 11 million pounds business
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became "frequent" after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby has left a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to concentrate on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of articles to read and access Truly.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The representative of This Morning, 37 years old, announced in the Instagram that he would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones alive by leaving the lucrative brand in the last minute to concentrate on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "frequent" when the gold girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which value may amount to 1.5 million pounds) involved leaving time to devote to her brand of art and accessories Truly.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in the Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones had a plane for one of his holiday houses abroad.
One source said: "Truly was far more than Holly's priorities.
It would mean the long-term resolution of its future and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave has left all completely scared.
No one believed what was happening on the third day... was so close to the launch.
There's a full stock of articles ready to sell at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation, which is among the most lucrative videos in Britain, will cost millions to the company, given the profitable investment in products, which will go from carpets and see the clothing and articles for rent, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
The houses make holidays together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is ready to become a brand ambassador to the M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a program representative of the I'm A Celebrity of the ITV.
A close source of Jones said last night that "We do not intend to comment on his business".
It's hard to talk "and then we'll meet again"
The North American President pointed out the criticisms that he would be proud of the means of communication by making a comment that some would consider "no president" and by revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said, in his voice, "Television pipe."
"I didn't give up on anything."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in a second meeting after her initial meeting in Singapore in June, and stressed that it would be a great step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are under way.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho said to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "responsive" US response to the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were ready to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been dead.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of the fire tests, support for release of renegades and return to the country of the dead of North American soldiers.
In addition, he defended his involving approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be honored by a president, but instead of finding 10,000 people out there trying to get into this superlodged arena, we'd have about 200 people on foot right here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause destruction on an island, causing hundreds of people to die
For example, in the earthquake in Lombok, it was said to foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been expelled, national disaster was not declared a pre-requisite for channelling international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they are not asking for international assistance; therefore, it is becoming a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Although the Save the Children are organizing a team that will lead the Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies were allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains extremely poorly prepared for the fires of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, anti-tsunami clothing are not popularly warned in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarm in Palu, despite the presence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will last for at least three days to reach the location of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who did the improvement of the infrastructure, described a central part of his electoral campaign, spent enormous amounts of roads and roads.
However, the lack of funding has led to the execution of Mr Joko, at a time when his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted while Christian bands and Muslims fought in the streets using catanas, bows, arrows and other handguns.
See: Daniel Sturridge do Liverpool makes a long finish for the smell of empathy against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a gol in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters away from the Chelsea balsam, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a finish towards the second step.
In an attempt, the ball flew high over the big area by heading towards the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on an Arrizabalaga cable in flight and fell into the network.
"It was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq made the best possible, so he was just winning the best possible time," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I see the song coming, I take a touch and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won for 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute, from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the advance of the blues gave a step back to Matthew Kovacic before demarcation near the middle-field and perform a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick move in the middle of the camp.
Then he made a fine finish that went through the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
This crossed the defenses and made the goose against the second traves with a left foot ending that passed by the Alison Becker guard of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Napoles in the phase of groups of the Campus League to the 3rd afternoon in the Stádio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will confront Videoton in the UEFA European Union on Wednesday afternoon in London.
Number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia falls to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, declared the country's disaster response agency early on Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the destructions of buildings that had been destroyed during the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in the sixth quarter, which triggered waves reaching 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, the agency's spokesman, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of the buildings they destroyed.

The Statute of Cromwell of Parliament became the most recent monument in the context of the "historical revisionism"
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice by its destruction, which recalls the perpetration by the Taliban, of so many cultural and religious artifacts in English, and which was carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a joke" and "a attempt to rewrite History".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell alongside the Westminster Palace would become an altar to fall.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his past Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is surrounded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defence of parliament against external pressure, in its case, of monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate description is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents a side of this division.
Their successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and remembrance."
Why the killer attacks and kills Chinese farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southeast China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his appeal "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered blood artery, near a pool on the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, was read in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The sonicultor is prepared to inject vaccines in pigs in a sunin culture on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, he will have traveled with the first from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his first man found him dead and found a door for an open neighborhood.
In that pool, he said, he was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 pounds, had attacked the sonicultor until death, according to the report.
"My first legs were covered with blood and torn, said the first, referred to by his appeal "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras show Yuan to enter the market at 4:40 a.m. on Friday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan nor to his firstborn.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent other people from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Relations claim that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have already been reports of swine attacks on human beings.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in her fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig with 300 kilos mobilized a galley farmer against his tractor until the woman was able to scare the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba declared to the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulation".
"They're just playing.
They like to kiss, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect," he said.
The Russian prison's requisitions should bring strong generalized rain to the south of the United States
As planned, the Rosa hole is breaking down when it moves over the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains all over the north and south of the United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Sunday's East Time, Rosa suffered a fall of 137 km/h, a block of category 1, located 620 km south-east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to form a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of the Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north in the south-east area of the United States.
On the second day, it will cause precipitation that may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical humidity to interact with depression in the vicinity will produce strong generalised rain in the south in the next days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause dangerous, hazardous rainwaters called wastes and, possibly, earthquakes in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitations that can reach 5-7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to reach 5 to 10 mm of precipitation in Southeast areas, especially on much of Arizona.
There are possible frequent floods with conditions in rapid cultivation, due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It is highly unusual to walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Strong precipitation can make the defiladers turn into rough rivers and found behind strong peak winds and dust clouds.
Depression in the vicinity will result in strong precipitation on parts of the coastal southern California.
There are possible total precipitations of more than 12 mm, which may cause small calls of deserts and narrow roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the cold season in the region.
A few tropical aquifers will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of the Sunday and at the beginning of the afternoon, before the rain becomes more widespread at the end of the afternoon and the third.
The rain is strong to spread in Four Corners on the third and will lose to the fourth.
The month of October can record strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic approaches. However, tropical areas will remain quite a threat.
Sometimes, this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic differences in temperature throughout the central area of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next days, the constant summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern regions of the United States will register a warm start in October, with generally distributed temperatures from 27 to 30 degrees south to the north.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on the third day, which would take about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of the incidence of temperatures above the average in the eastern region of the USA until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people attended last night at six television stations to the Witness Abbott of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and of the woman who accused him of sexually abused in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impact continued with the stations to interrupt the regular programming due to a recent turn of time: an agreement drawn up by Senator Jeff Flake in order for the FBI to conduct a week's investigation on the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Commission that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had caught her as she was pregnant and tried to throw her out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed witness, said he has absolute certainty that this has not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbering from Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of players in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring hearings of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscares ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC was seconded with 3.26 million spectators.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2,52 million, refers to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the sixth-party drama.
After the moderated Republican office has issued a statement stating that its vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was arrested by the CNN and CBS cameras on the morning of the sixth day when he was deliberately attacked by demonstrators when he tried to enter an elevator to address a hearing by the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained invisible to the ground while he was criticized directly for CNN's cameras.
"I'm here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that it would have to say more at the hearing of the committee.
The cable and radio stations were all covering the event in an hour later, when the Judicial Commission was voting to make the appointment of Kavanaugh to continue for a vote at the plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do it in understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against him for the next week, which the democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was in part convinced after conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh.
First Minister May accuses the critics of "political making" with Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused the critics of their plans to leave the European Union 'political' with the future of Britain and to undermine national interest, in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, comes to the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, in Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview with the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as "Chequers Plan" by the Minister for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the rates of the other party is "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims Homicide: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson's suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police hold a suspicion of Sims' death shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with murder at the second grade, according to the Department of Baton Rouge Police.
The authorities released a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, having the police stated that Sims lost his eyes during the battle.
The police recovered them at the scene and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA, news to WAFB, a CBS branch.
After asking Simpson, the police mentioned that this man had killed Wade with a fire weapon.
A $350,000 loan was set up, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge's medical-legal parish office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head that spread to the neck.
The department refers to the collaboration of the Task Force of the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University police and the residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced, with a height of 1,98 m, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
In the morning morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "devastated" and "cocked" by Wade's death.
"This is what worries us forever," said Wade.
Vulcan ejectes cinca in Mexico City
The Popocatepetl volcano’s emulsifiers reached the villages south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a recurrence of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas emissions and ashes in a 24-hour space.
The center has detected a number of cold and trembling noises.
Images on the social networks showed fine snow beds covering the car brakes in the streets of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake devastated the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Confrontations between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote by independence
Six people were held in Barcelona on Saturday after confrontations between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer referring to catalan over the sexes.
A group of masked separatists, worked by the intervention police, reached it with eggs and launched a tent in powder, creating dark cloud of dust in streets that are normally filled with tourists.
There were also later confrontations, in which the police used the bulkheads to contain conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced Unionists, who shouted "Long life for Spain."
Forty people received treatment of minor injuries suffered in protests, which can be read in local press.
The tensions remain high in the region focused on independence, one year after the reference of 1 October that was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The electors had deliberately chosen independence, although the influence on the Urns had been low, with a majority of those against them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the vote in polls scattered by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups had been engaged during the night on the sixth day to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although it has been carried out, this manifestation has been forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalunha would become independent.
"In the past year, we live our best moments.
I see my parents cry out with joy because they can vote, but now we are blocked," he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections in December last, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulties in maintaining this year's impact, with their most known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention to wait for judgment for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since last year, announced that they would apply to the European Parliament in the elections of the coming year.
"Presenting me as a candidate to the European elections is the best way to declare the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men detained after car hire against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car had repeatedly attacked in a home in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in the Ballynagard Crescent on Friday at 1930, in the British summer.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred in the ports and in the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have shot an animal against the car.
Menga attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goo for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, scared the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as the technical of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed level, with the Hibernian second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a victory outside the home in the first division of this period, faces Hearts leaders, with more than eight points, on the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will meet at home the Quick Vienna in the European Union on Friday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended its six games to its succession of unscathed confrontations in the division, with the main Holt trainer without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against entroped visitors
Holt's team should have made progress in the marker much before the goose, because the incisive character of his game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson entered the defense, but he was allowed to stand in front of the ballast and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort long after he was hiding to find Craig Halket's head on the ball.
The house team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the football games stopped.
And that's how the crucial gorge came up.
Rangers gave a book and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated themselves to make the trip to Menga, who gave a touch and walked from the center of the big area.
At that point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the house's impenetrable team, and Liam Kelly's guards had no major problems.
This pattern continued on the second part, although Alfredo Morelos had forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the legs of the Rangers guard, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a tock far from another game of football that stopped Livingston.
Crossings continued to come to the large area of Livingston, which were subsequently resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halket's investment on Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were rejected by the tree.
Livingston "fenomonal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed the expectations in this ascending trajectory.
Your game style and staff have changed little since you returned to the big teams, but you need to praise Holt in the way he galvanized the eleven since your arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was a colossal, getting an extremely well organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to give her maximum during the game.
Whatever the case, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality demonstrated at times with Gerard, the team was very close to these standards.
Your final game was not inspired (only once they were able to open the home team), forming a kind of warning for the Rangers, which is found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is welcome in Colonia
There were tears under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, whose aim is to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colonia to introduce a new and giant mix.
The city hosts the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed presence in the halls to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, many of their Kurds, also heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Antagonical protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor called a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accidents in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The incident took place near the crossing of the Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a street driven in Deptford, south of the city, about 10 a.m., a British summer time.
The driving driver stopped and a relief team stopped, but the cyclist fell in the ground.
This collision takes place months after the death of another cyclist on a flight in the Children's Street, about a mile away and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform their family members.
Barriers and deviations were placed for cars, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six wounded agents in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security male prison, referred to the Prisoner.
The disturbances, which still continue, began at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 09h30, the British summer time on Saturday.
Special "Return" agents were called to resolve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to a valley.
The agents received treatment of small facial wounds at the site.
A spokesman for the Prison Services said: "You have been using specially trained teams to resolve the ongoing incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received treatment of injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it must be clear that the names of the responsible officers will be communicated to the police and these can last longer after the degrees."
The HMP Long Lattin is home to more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Fracão Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with recent floods (the areas affected by drought may benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is precisely what is expected for the beginning of the next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hole passes through the Southeast Desert, involving the risk of recent floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued notice of sudden flooding for the second and third days, for the south and east regions of Nevada, for the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct trajectory on Phoenix on Wednesday, approaching the end of the afternoon with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix referred to a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles kept a state of tropical storm or depression in a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a fortress that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre of Furacons provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southeast Desert, such as the Central Rochosa Mountains and the Great Bay, can be received from 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of all isolated ones that can reach 10 mm.
For those who are not affected by the risks of frequent flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southeast is currently being affected by drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," reported the site weather.com.
First of all, the Rosa farm will reach the continental masses by crossing the peninsula of the Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa, still with a force of noise on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's breaking down.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal area in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the evening or at midnight.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of floods.
"A total of 8 to 10 mm precipitations are expected from the Caliphornia Bay to the north of Sonora, being possible maximum of 25 mm," the site weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north, traversing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of the morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of the third-party night.
"The main expected danger of Rosa or her fishing is the very high precipitation in the low California, north-west of Sonora, and in the south-east of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rainwaters produce re-inundances of wastes in the deserts, with risk of life, and aluminums in mountainous lands.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four inmates by attempted murder
Three adolescents of male sex and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with short-arm wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4:00, in the British summer, on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains stable.
During the night, a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man in Radstock's area, contacted the Avon and Somerset police.
The agents called on everyone who could have mobile pictures of the event that they were present.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was the victim of the pity and anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the implacable and ultrasound tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the beginning in Wheeling, in West Virginia.
Trump mentioned that Kavanaugh was "a victim of love and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of Congress on Friday, having been deeply and emotionally disillusioned by Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually abused for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness in the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said the majority of supporters of the West Virginia.
The president later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican influence to the Uranus in the inter-national elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for excellent candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats are in a mission of "resistency and obscenity.
The first procedural vote in the sitting on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place by 6 p.m., said to the CNN a major contribution to the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them were caught by the giant waves that reached the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami reached the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities communicated on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on the sixth day, when waves with up to six metres of height covered the beach at dawn, drawing many to death and causing a sudden destruction on their way.
Tsunami occurred following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunami arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the accident," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to reduce the effect of Indonesia's disasters (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't move alone: he pulled cars, trucks, houses, reached everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people took the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated for 24 centers in Palu.
The public air photographs by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed bridges, and a nearby pool of water.
The coastal city continued to be torn apart by repeats on the Sabbath.
The earthquake series was heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) referred to a statement that the energy released by the enormous sub-six-night wave was about 200 times the power of the extended atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, may have been amplified by the size of the tsunami, read in the declaration.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and referred to thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels.
Some victims' bodies were found under the roofs of the damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and damages can be deeper along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, an area with the name of Donghea, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Donghea, referred to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can worsen much more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had reached Palu, although the authorities have stated that waves rose at the time the warning was issued.
In a amateur film published on social networks, one can see a man in the upper floor of a building shouting phonetic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people in the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, drawing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive energy cut that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started sending cargo aircraft with Jakarta and other cities. However, refugees still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was opened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially for more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although it has been safe to arrive in the city of Palu, where the officials are staying in mud roofs mounted on the floor of their offices, the staff of the World Vision of Donghea crossed destruction scenes on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to begin their wonderful relief tasks for the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulation, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if this is declared "national disaster zone".
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a level of provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Red Cross Indonesia.
"Where the government says "OK, this is a national disaster," we can open the doors to international assistance, but this statute does not yet exist."
At the fall of the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of 6th-century, friends and family of the still missing still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that touched the shadows of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was taken away from an exodus.
On Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had stayed in the holes for two days beside the mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, the trainer of the Indonesian national team of parapente, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandiya, were their students.
"As an elderly coach, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that, in hours after the news of Hotel Roa Roa's drawing, he had begun to travel between the parapet community, unexpectedly sent messages in WhatsApp to the Palu sportsmen, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only a censorship verification mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Ladrons carry $26,750 during automatic box resuscitation in Newport on the Levee
On the sixth day of the morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's officer who re-opened an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement by the Department of Police of Newport.
The driver of the car was deleting an automatic box in the variety complex and preparing to introduce more money, referring to Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communication.
While he was busy, another man "surrendered behind the Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fled from the area, according to the communication, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on their identities should contact the Newport police via number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name--to Ye.
When announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former being known by Kanye West."
West, 41 years ago, received some of Ye's and used it as a title for his eight-year-old album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation at Saturday Night Live, where your new Yandhi album is expected to be present.
This intervention is intended to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled it for "emotional reasons", informing the artist of the show.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you", said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album next to the Big Boy Radio presenter.
"Portante, I'm you, I'm us, we are us.
Come from Kanye, which means "the only one," for only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was otherwise known by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference by the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West co-workers, JAY-Z, also used variations of their name with or without hyphen and mauscules.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to resort to civilians
The Mexican elected president, Andres Manuel López Obrador, committed himself not to use the military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot against a peaceful demonstration in the square, on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when Swedish student movements were implemented throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by giving them message subsidies to those who study and open more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities would drag young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China strengthens its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research costs in this area, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made announcements related to IA, although the country does not have a global formal strategy on the subject.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: aims to lead innovation in IA by 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new IA revolution," said Lee.
To double funding could double the chances of the next major success of IA being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to the NCB in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Synoving Ventures, a company that invested one of the most prominent IA companies in China, to Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an IA system that destroyed Othello's best-classed American player. Later, he performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee credited the US government's previous technological competitions such as the Challenge Robotics of the Department of Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next viewers.
U.S. researchers often have to make great efforts to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; they're companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired universities to work in IA.
Lee pointed out that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to put an end to its efforts in the IA field.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be granted automatically to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in the industry and in the academic field, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment this month in an initiative designated by AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in the IA field investigation.
However, the legislation of the United States aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not yet been established months ago.
Macedonians voted in favour of the change in the country's name
The Macedonians were voting on Sunday to decide on the change in the country's name to the Republic of Macedonia, an initiative that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which integrates a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim on its territory and has seen its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on a new name proposal, but the opposition nationalists argued that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly slave.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the influence on the Urns would be sufficient to meet 50% of the requirements for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it for NATO and the EU to accept the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts in the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the expectations of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission stated that there were no records of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the appeal was only 16%, compared with 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters joined in voting.
"We voted for my children; our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change in the name of the country, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small square and placed chairs in front of the tents built by those who would break the reference.
"We are NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top and not the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be received as Macedonia, we can direct others like China and Russia to become part of the Eureka integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO's entry will provide much-needed investment in Macedonia, which accounts for a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe the majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Tuesday revealed that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, below the required influence.
Another survey, carried out by the Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the appeal must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first important desire in the pro-occupational government's policy since it took place in May last year.
See: Sergeio Aguero of Manchester City runs all the Bridgeton defense towards the golo
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in victory for 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday, Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I'll make it look ridiculously easy in your throat at 65 minutes.
The advanced Argentina received a passage in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach an open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
It ended a defense before neutralizing the race, but others at the borders of the great Brighton area.
Then he took a walk to his left, where it was Sterling.
The advanced English used its first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, which, with the right button, broke the Brighton Mathew Ryan's guard-rest with a finish on the right side of the network.
"He's already arguing with some problems in his feet," said the journalist Pep Guardiola, the city's coach.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky for him to have marked a bullet at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage against the Premier League.
That smell was marked at 29 minutes.
He got the ball well in Brighton's territory in this game.
He took a step over the defenses along the left side of Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before leading Sterling towards the second step.
Sky Blues' advancement hit the ball for the network immediately before moving out of the field borders.
The city confronts Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Campus League at 12:55 p.m. on the third day in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the lives of Rockies difficult
With the Nationals removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the always competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the end of the Rockies, which hold a leadership of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies had at least luck with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Saturday night, but they still intend to secure their title from the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can enter the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the holder's launch for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to effect the launch in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a session in the Bullpen on Friday and launched in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player in Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 ERA and 300 strakeouts in 220 2/3 entries at this time.
Trump takes place in West Virginia
The President later referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while referring to the importance of the republican influence in the inter-national elections.
"All we did is in play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I'm not competing, but I'm competing and that's why I'm all over the place to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, they're seeing it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using all the necessary means. Are they seeing evil, cruelness?
They don't matter who race, who have to go up to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats, he said, have the mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And they saw it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "aggressive, bad, deaf and lying."
The President referred to the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate's Judicial Committee, having received voices from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Do you want to close the document anyway?
Well, then, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one--that was a physical language even worse--the worst physical language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has ceased to be inclusive.
It's intolerant for those who openly give their opinion
When the activists of my local sports organization voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise to me.
At the end of the accounts, I am the most recent of a series of working Members in Parliament to whom it has been said that they are not welcome - all by openly expressing our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was a victim of a similar treatment because he faced anti-Semitism in a resolution.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for disclosing Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically issues similar to those that Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East working meeting in the sixth quarter mentioned that "we believe the meetings are inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local representative working in Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, he has stopped being the volume of many of the meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy was very forgotten, if it has ever been concrete.
It has become increasingly apparent that different points of view are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not to be accepted by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues with whom he thought he was participating in a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and take positions with whom he would never agree - whether they were on national security or on the EU's single market.
As long as I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a torrent of insults on social networks that call for "missing", accusing the policies of the centre, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's going through this.
In fact, I know I have a lot more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are directed to me tend to be political.
I am afraid of professionalism and the determination of these colleagues who face a range of existing or racist insults every day, but who never resort to them.
One of the aspects that most delirium me in this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or modification of the selection rules, the party narrows its eyes.
I received numerous advice over the last two years, instructing me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that thus "it would be all right" for me.
But it wasn't for that to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, implicated by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher who left the classroom of my school literally scattered in squabbles, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as an author or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promote the movement on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is headed for a Brexit that will damage families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the moment of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threats of "missing" or political expeditions will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe will be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: from imperishable Ayr to the top
Two late trials showed the result in some way, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this incredibly interesting game of Tennt's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only ten undamaged.
In the end, it was a better defense and better risk management that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we've continued immeasurable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merit goes to Ayr. They're better at risk than we are."
Grant Anderson's test in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, having Jason Baggot used an unconverted test.
Climate extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the medium-time, has marked and then turned a solo test to place the marker in 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started well on the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from cow to the outside and, after the re-entry, Ayr strengthened the leadership with a test of Stafford McDowell converted by Climo.
The Ayr's captain in exercise, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the digital advantage with an unconverted test by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense investment of pressure.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having dropped the ball without the ball, in the launch of the Penitentiary, MacPherson placed the ball in the back of the ball in progress of Ayr.
Climo turned, as he had done almost immediately after the renaissance, after Kyle Rowe had collected David Armstrong's kick box and sent Uncle Gregor Henry for the fifth test of the house team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, Still Game star, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular series, which writes and participates with the long-term food partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that in the ninth season, it would be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of the Affymorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "floating business of Glasgow's restoration".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country that has been deprived of its capital, expects the court to reopen its way to the Pacific
Mariners patrol a deck-covered ship in La Paz.
Public buildings host a blue-season flag.
The ship base of Lake Titicaca for the Amazons holds the motto: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
For the whole of Bolivia, a landless country, is still living the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile in a conflict of resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to navigate again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at the highest point in decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impression, a spirit of unity and seriousness and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will assist in the promotion of the TIJ's judgment on giant screens spread by the country, hoping that the Hague court will proceed in favour of its country's claim, so that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate, giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian Indian charismatic president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election in the coming year, also has much to play in the judgment of the Tuesday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," were the president's votes in August last.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that it would not even change in the case of the contrary.
The United Nations body, with its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chile to another country and has claimed that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ's sentence was passed only six months after the hearing of the final statements indicates that the case was "not complicated," referred to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert at international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have affected her.
"The issue of access to the sea was delayed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' relegating rhetoric has reduced some good residual advantage in Chile, he suggested.
In the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to keep the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in Haiti, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was rapidly invulnerable.
The next Tuesday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end up to 139 years of disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political model.
"Bolivia will never be deprived of its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country's trust in the USA
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said that his nation will never approach its nuclear weapons unless it trusts in Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
Their comments appear when US State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume nuclear diplomacy in the press, more than three months after Singapore's summit with North-Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri pointed out that it is an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and the objection of the US to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war will sometimes lead the North to join itself.
Washington refused to accept the declaration without giving Pyongyang first significant steps in the meaning of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are planning a second summit.
However, there is a generalised cetism as Pyongyang has real intention to reduce an arsenal that the country is still likely to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang in the month they come to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Momentes in Paris reveal the most recent line of huge hats along the way of a store near you
If you intend to expand your collection of hats or to protect yourself completely from the sun, you do not need to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the past a series of extravagance and oversized hats for their spring-ever collection of 2019, which left the set style in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats, and these designers sent these amazing creatures to pass on it.
The most prominent part of Valentino was an extravagance hat decorated with a wide suit similar to a pen that turned the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included quilted jewelry melancholys, a fetish hat and even analys, although they have not been designed to keep the warm head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks... even at the time of the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had dried lips and seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than with high costumes.
One of the creations looked like the milling equipment, with tubes and eyes, while the other looked like a cut-off ice dog.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, it's lucky.
The observers of estylism predict that these huge hats are on the way to a nearby store.
Oversized hats appear effervescent in the "La Bomba", the coat hat with a 61 cm bottom that has been used by all people, from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The brand of worship behind the very little practical one learned that it was spread by the social networks sent another great creation for the passageways: a beach bag on the floor almost as large as the model in the fact that it was transported.
The hot orange fan bag, decorated with raffles and with a white hair cap, was the most prominent part of the spring-war collection La Riviera of 2019 from Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told the F.D.: "I am waiting to see large hats and beach bags arriving at the shops for the next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a course of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to occupy their place of global citizens.
Since this is a educational sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum to measure, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter into his heart."
This quote well reminds us that we cannot rely only on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent studies this year, we make sure that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of benefit for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum classification of A.
These data, collected in 74 schools under the SCIS height, showed that 72% of students received the maximum note of A in Mandarim, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent Scottish schools are promoting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now dealt with in the same way that STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are in the curriculums of independent schools and not only.
An investigation by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Competence in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulty of employees in filling vacancies, 17% said about the lack of language skills.
Therefore, learning other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a tangible advantage in the future with an appetite for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language enough to maintain a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
So investing now in language education is important for today's children.
The field of various languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children better opportunities to find employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the 2020 horizon, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your son's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by a personal teacher specialized in the area.
Independent Scottish schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need for success, that is, what the future holds for them.
It is impossible that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the country's future. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect on education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is ending for the fans who want to see LeBron James start in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will participate in the opening game of the pre-term Sunday against the denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes to play is still to determine.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48, said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers' journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training in the beginning of this week, James was indicted on his plans for the chain of six games of the Lakers in the pre-time.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of YouTube at the start of Trump in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five beginnings scheduled for the next week, which include paragnes in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote expected for your election for the election of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen support for the inter-sessional elections to be held shortly, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time is the start of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The start of Trump in Wheeling, in the West Virginia, is marked for the 7th afternoon, East Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to attend the start of Trump in West Virginia online below a live transmission on YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearings this week to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court, who became tense because of allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote provided for in the Senate will be pending for a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this start-up torrent is to help the Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
Thus, officials of President Trump's campaign said that these five leaders in the coming week are "to give energy to volunteers and supporters as long as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority that remain in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is as fundamental to the president's agenda that this will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the adoption of the campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that has been dismissed, told Reuters.
Marked for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the night's logo could attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, in disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him help in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows that it has the strength to fight to keep the hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday mornings can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impetuous is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one in which players really believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where did they say the storm is coming now?
"There were a six-point advantage and now there are four, so we're dealing with it as a little impeccable," said Jordan Spieth while he was out of the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in advantage, of course, with four points ahead and with more than twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points in four.
Spieth has been killed by the tea at the green and is leading by the example.
Those funny party cries were getting higher as the round continued, with a crucial pout that made the fourth party an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind two.
His putt that won the game on the 15th produced a similar cry, from that guy who shows that he still believes that the American team continues to compete.
"It is only necessary that we concentrate and worry about our own game," said Spieth.
That's all the rest of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, which is unlikely but worshipable, is with four in four and cannot make a mistake.
The "Molywood" was the only duty not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Saturday afternoon and on the back of the 19th morning morning.
In this series, and given the form of its energy seems to flow from and for this turbulent crowd, the idea that they are players to fight on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to celebrate a European winning potential on the sun in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
In preference, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the Fourballs this morning, when he was on his team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front of the snow lit up the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they were never close to getting out.
However, on Sunday, there's no one to help them get out of it.
The forums and forums are as fascinating as seeing close due to the interaction between partners, the advice they give or not and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played a better part in a team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this forum session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 leadership on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter on the last day of Ryder Cup with a blessed advantage after having left the forums and forums for Saturday parties with a 10-6 leadership in front of the United States.
The inspired duete of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the classification in Le Golf National, up until now, of four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, fighting to preserve the trophies that had been lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team unsuccessful in the morning's forums, winning the series by 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the forums with two winning games, but did not achieve the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sundays 12 to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received some of "Molliwood", after a weekend, are only the only time to win four points in their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having beaten Woods and Patrick Reed on the Fourballs, they strongly strengthened the advantage, defeating a Woods without energy and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more infamous 5&4.
Woods, who had been arrested during two games on Saturday, discovered occasional geniuses, but already lost 19 of the games he argued in forballs and Forsoms, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's holidays, returned to partner Henrik Stenson on the forums, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third ranked in the world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a mild breeze in the southeastern of Paris, Europe did not always bring the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner for three times of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
The two gained a brave victory of 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the forums, losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history did a team reverse a disadvantage of four points before the singles, although Furyk's team, the holder of the title, just needs to empathize to preserve the trophie.
After two days in the second position, an attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "we think" to a unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was building confidence in the United States and that it was not possible for the country to bring its nuclear weapons to an end in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the demandling of the nuclear test centre and the commitment of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the US," he said.
"Trustless in the US there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our first disarmament."
Although Ri has recycled North-Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "fascated" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be compensated for the extent to which gradual steps were taken, its statements appear to be significant in the extent that they do not literally reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast with the previous positions of Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to working in the sense of "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to obtain a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang has first abandoned its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the heavy international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on the "first denuclearization" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, even to the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us in jail is an impossible dream for people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is building on our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the United Nations leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the part concerned in this matter was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that directing North Korea's Foguts towards the US territory was inevitable after Mr. Mau' Trump had called Kim the "man of the Fogites" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, Kim added praise for her courage to take steps in the sense of disarmament, but stated that much still had to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Thursday, Trump said that he did not have a calendar for this, referring to "to stay for two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Friday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue strongly until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to exclude the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles from North Korea.
Pompeo met Ri at the United Nations General Assembly and said after visiting Pyongyang again in the month he came to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was wrong.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although after North Korea had denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to disarming a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" they sought were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives in terms of normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the magic culture of studying in busy "directs" of caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of this university at the top of the world ranking often did not have the least idea of the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believed to be the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of the privacy of the sound on learning.
"At last, a girl came with me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young man said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, administered for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course of an hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, cortins, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about the way the athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to get to bed.
In another section participants are informed about how the long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of AVC, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the camps, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think in their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the effects on the health of the smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "making direct" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep well and in quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exaggeration and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid freezing, because the privacy of the sound puts the brain in a hunger-like way, making them constantly exhumated.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his studies last year in Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students who attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended to the students that they measure the use of an alarm for the time of going to bed, as well as to agree, and that they have consciousness of the harmful effects of the "white light" emitted by the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can regulate the circular rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's gorge the men of Gerrard
Rangers suffered another tragedy outside the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused the disintegrated team of Steven Gerrard a defeat for 1-0 in Livingston's season.
The team of Ibrox sought to record its first victory on his journey from the triumph for 1-0 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflecting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the frustrated Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga marked seven minutes before the end of the first part and the collection of Rangers, who had not been inspired, never seemed equal.
With the Rangers now going down to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third, and just behind the Hibernian for the difference of waves.
And even more problems may arise for Rangers after the Calum Spence line tax has been received treatment of a wound in the head caused by an object apparently affected by the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that exceeded Ayr in the middle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on his side, used the 11th of Livingston that stole a point to Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well- oiled team put the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the owner of the ball, but Livingston did more than he had.
The team could have marked it in two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's balsam, but the average lost its great opportunity out.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free spot was at the meeting of Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to finish off the second track.
Rangers was able to recover control, but hope was greater than faith in his game at the end of the third.
Surely Alfredo Morelos thought that he should have been given a great sentence in the fourth hour with his coliition with Steven Lawless, but arbitor Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers only got two to go to the ball first, but the old guard guard of Ibrox Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head ending and Ovie Ejaria's weak ending.
Although Livingston's guess at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is impossible that the team deserved it, as long as it is not due to its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't cope with a football game far away from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher took a step towards Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple finalization.
Gerrard moved in the interval, replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the lateral advance passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to take a long walk behind a long walk.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he arrived at Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
German: Geiger counter inventor
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning" page: On September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years ago and continues to CONTAR ... was born in Germany the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that was finally brought to the device known as Geiger accountant.
Since then, the Geiger accountant has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as an uranium.
When we put these auricles, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans said, "Look, now it's just crippling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that gave the name was still lost.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient and its modification to the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a common protein to many cancers, are then re-injected into the organism
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient and its laboratory modification so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including mothers, ovary, lungs, and also colorects, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involving removing immune cells from patients and "insinuating them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West ships a support diaribe to Trump enverging a MAGA hat after its appearance in SNL.
Can not open message
Kanye West was expelled from the study on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which the president of the United States, Donald Trump, said he would apply for presidential elections in 2020.
After running his night song, named Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he started a bravat against the Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
"How do you like Trump? He's racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satirie with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star played the witness of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate's Trial Committee on the allegations of sexual aggression made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the West Bravata dinner was published on social networks by the eater Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to switch from West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had passed a bad mouth on the boots because of the hat.
"They scared me in the trunks.
They said to me, "Don't go there with that hat."
I'm scared!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?" saying, "I would put my super-human hat on, because that means that no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments prompted the audience to leave and the participants in the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, told Variety, having one of the program said to the newspaper: "The whole study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had fallen a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of song I Love it delighted by Perrier's glaring.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "One of our most courageous spirits: OBRIGADO BY ENFRENTARES TO TURBA".
However, the interview programmer Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was just "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NO to reward someone (by understanding his music or by supporting his "art") who I think is to welcome and promote harmful ideology for the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that he was now "the first known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the past of Diddy, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince has changed its name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Allegedly attempted murder after excavation in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man had been beaten in a restaurant in the eastern area of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The Kingdom is expected to be presented to the Belfast Tribunal on Monday.
The charges will be analysed by the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Kit Harington War Star attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, War of the Thrones.
However, at 31 years of age, the actor attacked the stereotype of the machiist hero, saying that such papers on the screen make girls feel that they must be hard to be respected.
In a discussion with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit referred to believing that "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently happened with his colleague in the War of the Rose Leslie Tronos, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "very strong position" about addressing the problem.
"I have a very strong personal position at this time: what was wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we going to teach men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
And he continued, "What is it that is innocent and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel that they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the major issues of our time: how can we change this?
Because obviously something went very wrong for the young."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any pre-wars or riots when the series ends in the next summer, referring to him that the "combats and horses" were completed.
Since November, Kit will participate in a True West Reed of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Trons War.
"I know my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life in front of me," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the series of imaginations with Emmys.
The marriage took place in June 2018 in the fields of the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% drop in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities have stated.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV this way was reduced to practically zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Studies estimate that, due to the country's conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men ended up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases result from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-AIDS medicine as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters immediately avoids information about Republican senators by one of his collaborators and attacks the "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dismissed on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The democracy of Los Angeles stated that the charges were promoted by opinion leaders and websites of the "ultradireita".
"Ministers, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information published includes randomly the homes and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during an hearing with a Senate panel on the charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court.
The information flight occurred some time after the three senators have asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters Agency and published the data from a member of Waters' staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My colleague, whose identity, personal data and security were committed under these false and false allegations, had no responsibility in this information escape.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This disappointment is Coleric," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests that she does not have the temper to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something that isn't their responsibility, he can't be secular.
You can't have a challenging position.
You can't ask the accused's reasons.
You have to reveal peace and seriousness."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused of being too secular during the Friday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will discuss the location of Waters in the intercalar elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he read on his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" of these fraudulent claims.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny’s Criticism English Return to Attack - fail of spying film parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for contacts with Brexit in any new film with a British taste, and this seems to apply to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and translated back to life in 2011 with "The Regress of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-sacrifice on the subject of being so bad is the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes torn and an extremely elastic expression, obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that is a comprehensive chemical creation for non-englophone cinemas.
He is, of course, an idiot's secret agent who, despite his strange claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a platoon by Mr. Bean and something from that volcano that contributed with a single note on the theme of the film "Smoments of Gloria" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character was originally based on the traveler and an international mysterious man whose role atkinson played in TV ads to Barclaycard, who left the chaos in his tracks.
There are one or two interesting moments in this most recent edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English is approaching a helicopter carrying a medieval armor, with the rotor's legs soon making a carilion noise against the capacete.
The talent of Atkinson for the comedy is obvious, but the humor alone is weak and extremely superior, especially since the editions of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose the comedy as an ingredient.
We have come to the idea that the humor is directed to children and not adults and, in my opinion, the strange adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as the film numbers moved by Atkinson in the character of Bean.
Now, the premise, always now, is that the Great Britain is lying in a serious mess.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground to hinder the service agent, a painfully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last got for a prime minister who carries a bold and conflicting figure, to suffer already a total failure of political instability: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds him of the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material to large flights.
Your secret service consultants inform you that, since all the agents in the asset have been committed, you will have to get someone out of the reform.
And this one is the losers Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a small school, but giving informal lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a school of spying in the style of the film "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and reunite itself with your auxiliary Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attracted to a submarine commander, an exhilarating character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the disaster in the Secret Service of His Majesty are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being threatened by the billion-dollar charisma of the technologies that claim to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain: Jason Volta, left-handed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their rejection of absurd acts destroyed: disappointed by table workers, burned a sight French restaurant, created confusion as clenchedmen in the luxurious Aite of Volta, and English designed pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality eyes to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volta house.
All the paragons were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for the most nice and timed of all, the set has enough TV for children.
The result is pretty medium.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop saying, couldn't the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that justifies his talent?
Workers are disappointed that they are launching a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be weighing a radical plan to provide British a four-day working week, but with five-day pay.
Relations suggest that the party wants the parents to reexamine the holidays with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for the workers, giving them a day of additional failure.
The workers obtained a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources refer to the idea of "adjustment" to the party's economic programme, which reorientes the country to the benefit of the workers.
For a four-day working week, the syndicates Congress had a favorable view as a way for workers to take part in the changes in the economy.
A high official of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "We expect to announce a revision of the policies before the end of the year.
"It won't happen one day for the other, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspirations for the party's approach to the re-equality of the economy for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this ambition is not favored at this time by the whole of the Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power from the hands of the "visible directors" and the "expectors" of the basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total share of current water business shareholders, as the Labour Party can make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees in company administration councils and to create inclusive securities funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which can be divided annually, which can go up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation to Kavanaugh can make them or not change their ideas
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to deliver on Sunday, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that makes them change ideas.
Kennedy showed himself open but his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"So when he came to the hearing, he said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called you after this happened when this statement appeared, and I asked you, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, inexhaustible."
Graham's vote, however, seems immeasurable.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and would need an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a strong disappointment," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see anything again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on a equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Central Park High Relevado, not only to assist activities such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness for the truth of the purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defence group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it actively.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the exhibitors had to run a series of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways to increase awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clicitivism" - do we find that it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a range of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion relating to the same amount being paid or made.
The group estimates that the funds received have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom with investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and the Global Citizens as well as all of us, we can become the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd in a concert to live in London, April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 press actions on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions from the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and bitter way - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements by civil rights and anti-partity that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are among the artists who will work this year in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the sea as a "block" to put an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary", Washington may travel to its sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, where they intervene at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they intend to interfere with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south-eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with its sea, to ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, to make blocks to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke is directed to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In its intervention, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring to them in fact.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, rather or less, to promote and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements occur at a time when the administration of Trump is a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, which is the most expensive option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the administration of Trump, including the own president, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" pipeline project, which, according to Trump, became a "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, intends to double existing capacity for 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's persistent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, dealing with an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exercise pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak following a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position led to a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the top official of the German Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will deeply analyze" the opportunity to apply to the presidency in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on the Saturday that he will "really analyze" the possibility of applying to the presidency following the intercalar elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would weigh the possibility of applying.
"It reached the age of women going to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the ultimate responsibility," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a deep look at the possibility of applying to the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, referring to "he was taking the country to the wrong direction".
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a hard vocal critic of Trump and his name for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents are not of the opinion that it should apply to the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts' "probably" voters said that the senator should not apply, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% give their support to their application.
The survey revealed a higher support than a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed with regard to a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at Donald Trump's start
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his arrest in September.
On Tuesday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what is going on after he's gone back, I can identify myself with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds with which our soldiers actually return," said Donald Trump in support of a committee in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "are a little different, they return tired, they return to indignating if there is such respect for his fellow soldiers and planes, and all the other members of the armed forces have left the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Tuesday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of weapons as alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Department of Police of Vasilla.
Twelve states and the Columbia District support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Ten states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal response to a new policy of the United States that refuses asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a friend's statement (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is responding to this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union intervened in August against politics was not revealed.
The person said that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang," abused him, but the US authorities denied his asylum application on 20 July.
The complaint was filed in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, such as countries facing generalized problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy rejected a 2014 decision from the Immigration Resources Council that would allow immigrants without documents of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be appreciated on the basis of specific facts and circumstances which are subject to them; this prohibition violates this principle," read in the friendly statement curiae.
Lawyers also argued in this statement that the ban on the entry of immigrants by the police has a negative impact on the US economy, stating that they themselves are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to make the necessary work available".
Prosecutor-General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or adversity based on ethnic, religious, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement of policy on 11 June.
The asylum has never been designed to relieve all problems, not even all serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu when the number of deaths doubles in a counter-relog to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly hopeless.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35 years old, mother of a febrile baby of the male, comforting her in an evacation center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an amalgamation brings more bodies.
There's a clear water shortage."
Residents were warned to return to their destroyed houses to try to save everything they could find among their water-borne properties.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquakes, they were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who had broken the walls and shoulder, were outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to the strong replications they continued.
His eyes were lit up in tears when he told what he felt when the violent earthquake threw him down in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with the woman and the daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "produces"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper has published a four-page newspaper in the United States promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, the newspaper with more withdrawals from the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the elections of 6 November for Congress, a complaint that was rejected by China.
The claim by Trump that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked the beginning of what the American authorities, in statements to Reuters, described as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently developing a more intense trade war that has seen both sides applying tariffs on the imports of the other.
China's recovery rates at the initial stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states supporting the Republican Tromp Party, saying Chinese and North American specialists.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
In China, Branstad wrote an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "it is now putting the foot in the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertisements in our free press".
"With the dissemination of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the recent American tradition of freedom of expression and of press publishing an announcement to pay in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the contrary, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the discrepancies of opinions that the Chinese may have from their country's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although it did not mention what.
Republicans alienate women's voters before the intercalar elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warning analysts
While many important Republicans support and defend what is appointed for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh to face various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts believe that this could lead to a negative reaction, particularly for women, during the intercalatory elections to take place soon.
The emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to advance to a vote.
These things don't go back," said The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that there is no doubt that the recent pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) for carrying out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to appraise the revolving voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang "November is at the door!" when they showed up at the Senate hall, as the republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to advance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, told Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the memories," said news site Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without partnership.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the decision-makers in the sub-urban areas and the youngest voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public witness described his allegations of sexual aggression against the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that a negative reaction might occur if the Republicans advanced with confirmation.
"This became a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about the way the Republicans dealt with the matter and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps choose Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be something divided about who to believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority to associate with the first.
A new survey of YouGov revealed that 41% of the inquisitors had absolutely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they had absolutely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or absolutely lying in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the Fleke proposal, the FBI initiated a investigation of Ford's allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to Guardian.
Ford referred under an oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had been sexually disturbed while drinking, when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the term for the Supreme Court exposed its genetic organs when the two participated in a party during the period during which they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a World Wide Web inventor, created a startup that aims to revalidate with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this legendary character of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that took part in the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said funnyly that the intention underlying Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data storage" or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the online personal data storage is that only the user can decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteers.
At the beginning of this week, world-wide technology makers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all their business models are due one day to the other.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a medium release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic with this next time of the Web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honoring the Condecked Clergy with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a warrior was hailed in its birth city over 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverendo Bernard Vann obtained the condecoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglis and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a French-Athraiser four days later and never knew he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons broke down a memorial plate in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "flyly symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that it gave the condecoration to its grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Coronal Vann led his battle in the transit of the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in a very frequent snow and under closed fire of portal and metal weapons".
Then he went to the fire line and, "with the greater validity," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and hit three soldiers of the highlight.
Lieutenant Coronal Vann was killed by a German-in-law on October 4, 1918, less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, mentioned that his grandfather's actions were "something I know would never be equal, but also a lesson of humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a flower crown after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the validity of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
In addition to the mixed crafts agreed all night to see the Bellator 206 assists in Porca Peppa instead.
Imagine this: it is agreed all night to see Bellator 206, full of views and, finally, it is forbidden to see the main event.
The San José series included 13 battles, with six of the main groups, and was being exposed directly during the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the confrontation, the exhibitors in the United Kingdom were terrified when the cover changed to Pippa Porca.
Some were not impressed after having been agreed to marry especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change for animated designs for children as "a kind of platoon of bad taste".
"The government regulation says that the content is not appropriate for the six mornings, so they had to change for another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the role of marketing and communications when concerned about transmission.
"Porca Peppa," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that the same will reset the transmission calendar to include the United Kingdom's exhibitors in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
"But it's six Sunday morning there and we can't solve it until our Sunday hour, which is the second Friday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were many mixed messages and nothing very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually did, and we're trying to overcome the expectations of the fans and we're going to exaggerate.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about his sexuality
Olym Daley said that he grew up to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he didn't notice until he went into school that "we're all like me."
In an interview with the first desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he showed himself in favour of the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope."
He also said to become a father to worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months of illness.
Looking like a pair in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" to everyone because "he wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of us feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and the strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that it was "someone", he said, not to deduce everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The second Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
According to him, he appeared because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The World Championship referred to being liked by a man, American cinematographer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "approached me with surprise".
Daley was in the past year with the winner of Oscar, 20 years older, although he has stated that the difference of age has never been a problem.
"When we go through so much when we're so new" - its first participation in the Olympic Games was 14 years old and the father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has passed by similar heights and lows.
The marriage had a son last June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspectives" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all that mattered was to get a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley pointed out that his father did not accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell you "You're not going to be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I was sure it wasn't his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally realized that he wasn't invulnerable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in 2012 Olympic Games and obtained a bronze medal.
"He was fully aware that it was what he had dreamed of all life: walking in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympics... there was no better feeling," he said.
All of this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, of Heather Small - with which he had been identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and that he is still given the skin of the chicken.
The desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson under the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will arrive at a memorial on Saturday when discussing his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the frame from symbolizing an unhappy occasion.
Mickelson, playing on the 12th anniversary of the event, a record of participation, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in the mornings and Saturdays.
Instead of being at the center of action, as has often been in the United States teams, the five-time winner of the major male champions has divided the day between the role of the supporter and the work in their field, in the hope of restoring what it is concerned with.
I've never given the most rare tattoos even in the height of your career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long-term dog usually beats the wrong tattoos.
And if the field itself was not only frightening enough, Mickelson, on the ninth Sunday, will face the necessary British Open Francesco Molinari campaign, which made a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all the four parties they discussed this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single parties, record a good start, the Mickelson game can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role I had today, gave me a palm on my back, put his arm around me and said it would be early tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
It's a respected campaign that made these teams great in the past, and also this week.
I probably didn't care to see him play two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Faldo's record on Sunday of the largest number of games discussed in Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a race at Ryder Cup which has never been able to equal the success of your individual race.
Mickelson has 18 beats, 20 hits and seven hits, although Furyk has stated that his presence created some introductory advantages for the team.
"He's cute, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives much more than just to play."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear on a plane
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his leadership failed when he entered the last day of singles in Ryder Cup can easily become an accident.
The Danishs had their star in the battle of 1997 in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the target line with the nariz with the most narrow of the margins, winning by 141⁄2-131/2.
"We always tried to remind ourselves that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a while," said Bjorn, in the picture, after having attended the 2018 tournament for 5-3, both in the sixth and last night, to lead 10-5 in Le Golf National.
Thus, history has shown me to me and to all who are on this team that this has not yet ended.
Tomorrow, give your best.
They're going there and they're doing everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophie and that's where the focus must remain.
I've always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of who's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Thrilled with the performance of his players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance to myself that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow's important are individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there for our account, our skills as golfers are tested at the highest level.
This is the message you need to send to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they will leave the partner and he must go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast with Bjorn, opposition Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better individual performance than as partners, making the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
The Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before it ended to lose when Europe took off the cart the "Milagre in Medinah".
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about the way Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what they saw in Brooklyn and what they saw in Medinah.
When this pressure is directed towards one side, the pressure is very large in these medium-sized games.
We organized our effectiveness in accordance with it and ordered the players in the way we felt, you know, that we are going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, faced Rory McIlroy at the main game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter were the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I choose this group of players for this order because I think it covers all the tracks," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
A new German warship once more
The latest failed German marines should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships during the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until the next year, due to the systems that are suitable for the adventures and a cost of exponential growth, according to local media.
The entrance to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the most fragile battalions of the Baden-Wuertmberg class, was now added until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited a military voice.
The vessel should have joined the sea in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems threatened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertmberg class that the sea had ordered in 2007 will serve as replacement for the broken aged Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-ships and anti-shipships, as well as some fungic technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest broken down in missions with a maximum duration of two years from the port of origin.
However, the late remnants have made that with the warships of the last generation, considered as a form of Germany's design of power beyond borders, they will already be detached when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 failed to make mistakes last year when the German sea refused to put it in service, having returned to the stables of the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the sea returned a ship to the ship after the delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media mention a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a fight mission.
The software's shortcomings were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuertmberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, only half of the quota required in the oldest fragmented Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine capacity to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7000 tonnes, has the good weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the hardware failure, the total project price, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached an estimated EUR 3.1 billion, an increase of 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems facing the most recent fragile have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the sea is currently being unmanned with ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem had grown exponentially over time, because older ships were put out of service without ships to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the class members of Baden-Wertemberg had been able to join the sea.
National Trust Saves the Secret Life of the Mortgages
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how the dogs use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to cause some light on the behavior of these single flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as the long ears and daubenton's cats in Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to follow the activities of the fishermen along the station.
Mobile studies will also be conducted by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will assess the frequency of the calls of the males and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of its behavior on the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, an observer for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important to the molluscs and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grassland, as well as the best way to ensure the maintenance of forests for the molluscs and associated species.
The population of swine in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has grown significantly over the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development work that affects bedrooms and reduce habitat.
Eolitic turbines and explosives are also a threat, along with dead-mose papers and some chemical treatment of construction materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the dogs are not blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they try to catch the catch.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, is very serious.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conducted studies, inspection of bedrooms and sometimes rescues.
He also came to create the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to the pigs, in the property Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of Scottish swine.
The owner's director, David Thompson, says that the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for dogs," he said.
"We have old buildings, many Veterans trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the ants that we do not know, so the work we have developed here and in other properties will help us learn more about what they need to blossom."
It stressed the importance of ensuring that there are infants before maintenance in the property, as the non-intended destruction of just one maternity bed can lead to the death of up to 400 young women and young animals, which could lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
The dogs are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, kill them, disturb them, or destroy their bedrooms.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, Scottish leader of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate in helping.
It was because she said, "We still have much to learn about our babies, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are coming."
Ronaldo disqualifys rape charges when his lawyers prepare to process German journals
Christian Ronaldo characterized the allegations of violence against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using their name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advance of the Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that it will then pay $375 000 to keep the victim silent about the incident, read in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a direct video on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, with 33 years of age, described the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," he said to the camera the winner of five Gold Balls.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to process Der Spiegel on allegations, which have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspects in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will take place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they have been found in a night club, Ronaldo and Maorga will have been randomly gone to the player's room, where he will have violated it anyway, according to the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
However, Ronaldo says he was put out of holes after the alleged incident and told him that it was "99%" "a good type", damaged by "one per cent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the marriage had sexual relations, but that it was consensus.
Majorga also claims that she was directed to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she will later agree to enter an extrajudicial agreement by feeling "terrorized by the prospect of prosecution" and being concerned about the possibility of "publicly humiliated".
The woman, aged 34, now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was ready to join the Royal Madrid, from the exit of Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer turned to Italian giants Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "repent forever" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "repent itself forever" has lost its status as world leader in the car industry after Brexit, said Secretary for Greg Clark Enterprises.
Clark also pointed out that Toyota in the United Kingdom had stated to the BBC that if Great Britain had left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer pointed out that the impact of delays on borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produced the models Auris and Avenues of Toyota, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that, if Britain comes out of the EU incorrectly at the end of March, we will watch the production parasites in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the EU's exit without agreement with the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, mentioned that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to the fact that manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with the pieces coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured by command.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector says can lead to delays and loss of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in its Derbyshire factory, he said the company, so production should stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future EU relations was "scalibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as he said, not only the current success but also the use by us of this opportunity," said today's BBC Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it had not been able to provide an estimate of the time of suspension, Toyota indicated that, in the long term, added costs reduced the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinated the United Union trade union in that area, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back again.
A government spokesman said that "we have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
A meeting of Trump with Rosenstein can be added again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "added another week" given that there is still no understanding about Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's advisers and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The fact that Trump can be preparing the dispatch of the Deputy Attorney-General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of unmistakably recording the talks with Trump and the possibility of leaving the President via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has deduced the information.
But last Friday he moved to the White House, with information that he would be ready to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, which was held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I'd rather not give up" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then added to avoid overposition with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On the sixth day, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press assistant, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, may be this week but may also be added a week, bearing in mind all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders does not hold a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to a warning to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said, "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like protagonism."
He then made it clear that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President shall hold more meetings on questions and answers than any previous President," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We have analyzed these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to occur, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is definitely better than talking to me.
We tried to do this frequently and saw that we did it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they could talk to the President of the United States replaced any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
The press conferences alone are rare.
This week, the President showed why in New York, he appeared undisputedly and sometimes strange to the present journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service on Brexit's pensions
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working on the National Health Service elected to express the country's gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter at least six months after the EU UK's exit.
The Swedish government has already committed itself to costing the candidate status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services in the country.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "Over the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal were expected to be made for this autumn.
But the Government of the United Kingdom has also accelerated the preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate at this time how valuable the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality, is.
Members of the whole EU and of other sources bring a valuable experience and competence, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want them to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after suffering injuries in the head
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was submitted to an emergency surgery after suffering injuries in the head on Saturday at 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ, of the Tigers.
Tennesse's team trainer, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He drew close to the side line and practically disappeared," Reed reported.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying it in a bag and transporting it to a deeper evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year, suspended the studies during the first time with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five posters on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season for 18 posters.
A higher seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to cover a higher seal tax to foreign buyers who acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to non-abbreviated buyers
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The rise in sales tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to reach up to 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless
A higher pay tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to non-abbreviated ones, will be announced theresa May today.
The measure is dealt with as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest elected, with promises to make a more accessible accommodation available and to take the highest performances.
The rise in the land tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to stimulate the government's campaign to offer a roof to the homeless.
The ceiling - which is added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second rooms and purchases for rent - can rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to reach up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, making prices rise and making it difficult for first-room buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - became "fantama cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a court of the seal tax to help young people acquire their first apartment.
He told the large construction companies to keep the prices of the properties raised in the sugarcane areas they do not use, demanding that Mrs. May leave the quotas on the rooms available to resolve the "dangerous housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including wage checks and the end of costs "without justification".
I also want to assign the enlarged municipalities to the construction of new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is so easy to buy houses for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as well as for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of being generous from your house has become too far and the shame of who sleeps at rest continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
The Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is coming to become the Scottish electorate.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been successful in the challenge of giving life to the club in the north-east, currently third-classed in the First League, to the three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after directing St. Mirren on his return to the First Scottish Division in the past.
"To represent my country as a player.
But I just got an internationalisation B," Ross said to the Sports Sound program of BBC Scotland.
"I can see Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it has succeeded in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland trainer include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former coach of the Athletic Alloa says he didn't feel afraid when the names so consecrated in a club of such great size, after rejecting invitations from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, now the success is referred to as "can I take the club back to Prime League?"
Given the structure and facilities of the club, its location is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I just think it was a good thing here when I reach that goal."
Ross' career as a trainer has only three years, after a period of time as an auxiliary trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
Then Alloa helped recover from the decision to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of dispromotion to the campaign title at the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
To take account of Alloa's "it was a true encrosilized," remember.
"I've always seen me more in the role of trainer than in the player.
It looks weird because you did well, I got my life as a player, and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We've faced many challenges every week.
I still face the pressures and pressures of the job, but I feel very well as a trainer.
You always want to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurants chains.
The restoration groups recorded an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants increased by 4.8%, showing statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultant who compiled statistics, said: "The continuation of the good time and the career of England at the football World Championship, longer than expected, made the standard of the month of June, in which the pubs recorded a 2.8% increase in sales, was repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a harvest.
The loss of 1.8% registered in the sales of the restoration in June was punitive in July.
Pubs and bars with the silent business in the drinks had far better performance, with a homologous growth more than compensated for the decline in restaurants.
Pubs with the business in the meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks rose by 6.6% over the month, with meals to collect 3%."
Paul Newman, of the analysis of the laser sectors and RSM restoration, said: "These results extend the trend we have been recording since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors affecting the market sales of food outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when it comes to the extension of the cost pressure.
The long summer and hot summer could not reach any longer for operators with the profitable business in the meals. Only time will tell if the most dangerous temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the expansion of the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of the sales of the British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined business volume of over 9 billion pounds, being recognised as the benchmark of the sector.
One in every five children hiding from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in the social networks that conceals parents and teachers, revealed a study.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary school revealed an increase in the "false" pages in Instagram
The news angers the news about the publication of content of sexual nature
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show parents
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts on the social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "false" accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news angers the news about the publication of content of sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have an "primary" account in which to show parents, having at the same time private accounts.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found out that the teenager encouraged others to "swipe her."
The study conducted by the UK Digital Awarensess and the HMC Conference of Directors of Independent Schools revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which allowed them to keep private accounts.
HMC's director, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces online where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish athletic council
Eliidh Doyle was elected Executive Director of the Scottish Council of Athletics in the Annual General Assembly of the Regulator.
Doyle is the most practical medal of Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the last decade.
"Eilid is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and global community of athleticism and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will have a great deal to win with its presence in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute truly to help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-metre test in the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commenter in the BBC, left to go after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It's a month today that has a brain vascular accident.
I've been able to leave.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and until I did.
It's been a painful job but it's getting a total recovery, I've learned to go back and I've even been practicing agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
An announcement of milk extraction bomb compares mothers to cows, sharing online opinions
A milk extraction pump company shared online opinions with an ad that compares mothers who love cows in order.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first silent milk extracter bomb", Elvie's consumer technology company launched an ironic announcement inspired in the music videos to highlight the freedom conferred on the new milk-drawing mothers by the bomb.
Four mothers dance in a full-time vacation to the sound of a music that includes words like, "Yes, I'm ordering, but I don't have a fall" and "If you haven't repaired, I don't have tattoos, these are my tits."
The rehearsal continues: "Bombie, pumpkin, baby food, pumpkin, pumpkin, I'm ordering my babies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it eases the "horrors" of the Latinos sector.
"You decide to use cows to announce this product.
Like us, they have to grow up and give the light to produce milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after their birth," wrote a viewer.
The Elvie extraction bomb falls suddenly within a breast-feeding suite (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Scienceally traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone else said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarant".
"I think it's a great idea.
If he was still in love, he'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a crazy joke, but it makes all sense.
This product is great," one of the women wrote.
Another comment: "It's a fun announcement directed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like "vacas".
It is not an announcement to praise or judge the Latin sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the bomblights located in the suites.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's bomb is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and head gently inside a breast-feeding suite, giving women the freedom to move, to pick up their babies and even get out of the house while they're milking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that deserves an angry and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and milk cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and that people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time Elvie bomb was missing.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children jumped into the corridor to design Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children deliberately displaced for a camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained reached a peak, although the border crossings remained relatively unaltered, partly because the rhetoric and strict policies introduced by the administration of Trump made it difficult for children to escape.
Traditionally, most of the "grandchildren" are themselves undocumented immigrants, refusing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country while offering themselves to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the potential parents and other adults who integrate their family associations should register their digital impressions, and the data shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Control Service in Alfandangas, witnessed before the Congress that the service holds dozens of people who have applied for asylum in the absence of followers.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the inmates had no previous criminal activities.
"A portion of 80% of the parents or members of their family aggregates are found illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners with criminal record.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, in order to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those considered unlawful for aid will soon be deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are excessive in facilities of greater size than in Tornillo, where the great size contributes to the neglect of children’s disturbing signals.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or for the loss of friends increases the trauma that many have already discussed.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal from the "occupation forces" of the US, French and Turkish
Turning to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees to their home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moulalem, who is also the first Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are found illegally alone under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," said the Assembly.
Moulalem insisted that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions more displaced.
It was said that Damascus would continue "to carry on this sacred battle until we release all the Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and from "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and counseling Syrian forces and Syrian Arab forces to oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country destroyed by the war.
As for the question of refugees, Moulalem pointed out that the conditions for his return were secure, accusing "some Western countries" of "sailing irrational measures" that led refugees to stay outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're going to politics what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no help in rebuilding Syria while there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security area in the last large rebels in Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement avoided a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem pointed out that the agreement established "clear steps" and expressed hope that the military action would see the Jews, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the country for elections.
Moulalem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second mandate
According to this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the prosecution and scandals end their presidency in advance.
The one who would, of course, constitute "the most dramatic final of a permanent presidency"!
At the moment, there's no sign of the spectators' breathing.
Since 2014, there have been more than 1,05 million in the CNN and almost 1.6 million in the MSNC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in November, a rise to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC led the audience of the event with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC program "Designed Survivor", about a head of the office who becomes President after an attack that destroyed the capital.
In Scowell, a comedy veteran and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember once he called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," he told me.
The chaos has a value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike television programs, Washington's stories can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to the family meeting of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can give.
And yet, it is more than being a informed citizen when we are attending a six-hour expert debate on the use of "in-depth knowledge" sources by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear", the heart blouse of $15,000 of Paul Manafort" ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as Washington Post referred to by Stormy Daniels) and the implications of the mysterious descriptions of... hum...
For my part, I will never again find the Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he has done seems to be a reality show because he gives us something all night," said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on the dynamic list of Trump and the daily rotations of the network (attach to NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26th in the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house, I saw the MSNBC while writing CNN.
He did not hide from television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to witness before the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court in play.
"I still remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said: this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but finally they were right."

Meaning of external funding in the intercalar elections for the Chamber of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania is known for a flow of funding, thanks to the creation of the electoral circles that left two titlers on the run at the same place.
The recent restoration of Pittsburgh's suburban circles placed the democracy Conor Lamb in the race, which won its place in another circle in an extraordinary election in the spring past.
Lamb is running against another titler, the republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is largely supplanted in the new 17th century.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had decided in January that the old circles had inconstitutional favor with the Republicans.
The 17th round ran a long dispute over the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangental victory in the extremely controversial March exceptional elections for the 18th election circle of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
The US was able to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, returning to China
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Pequim, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from the direction.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of the North American diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "relevant decisions to cease recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a representative of the Department of State, in a communication this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalised this country in Central America with high unemployment and homicide rates.
Following the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, the top officials of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue in front of, on the whole, and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has organized an intervention at the conference, now marked for mid-October, in a signal of the importance the administration assigns to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives went back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House's vote for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three North American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the cover of the anonymous.
Their reports were consolidated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested the anonymous.
Study History
The next bomb to be launched could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there are currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be conducting his research in order to find out if the Trump campaign was designed with Russia to attack the elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Trump will face the responsibility of that body at the same time as it is prepared to present itself again to the voters and perhaps to be judged by his parents.
There are many hypotheses and I do not suggest that Mr Trump's absence is inevitable - neither to his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938 some German officials were prepared to give Hitler a state strike, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The course of History revolves around points of inflation like this, in which the inexhaustible course of democracy is accelerated or worked.
The North American are currently facing several of these inflation points.
What should we do if Trump dismissed the Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this paper reported that last year, he suggested writing in secret to the President, speculating on his inability to perform the task.
Rosenstein says The Times news is wrong.
"How will we answer if the recent requested FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court, despite the credible allegations of sexual abuse and the alleged witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the intercalar elections for a Congress responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we smile at these tests, democracy will be ready to cross a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to climb the streets of Sabath in that table with sustics.
With a legacy of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Optimistic Rangers before the game with the speed of Vienna
The Rangers receive Vienna's Rapid on Friday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive empathise in Spain with the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in good position to qualify for the Group G of the European League.
A joint injury prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time to the empathize the two balls with the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as trampolim for higher flights.
"It was a good score for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We found the game with a positive mentality and won a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but, in global terms, the empath was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part, but we gave it back and dominated it in the second part.
Thursday will be a big European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good outcome in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure we will give our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the trains are running well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past time and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with retiring of this post-reform account
Despite the fact that participants in the survey have a clear idea of the kind of care they intend to take, few people have talked to their families about the matter.
Nearly half of the individuals interviewed in the Nationalwide study referred to talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Just 10% mentioned talking to the children on the same subject.
"People want a family to take care of themselves, but they are not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Framework.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not deserve to know your wishes with due advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Includes your financial consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your continued care funding options may include a long-term long-term long-term insurance pool, a hybridised pool with monetary valuation to help cover these costs or finance by using its own savings, since it has these available values.
Prepare the legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care provider, choosing a person of your own trust to supervise your health care and to ensure that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating with them.
Consider also the establishment of a search for its funding.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly progenitor suffers a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only financial questions are in play, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Man raised several times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was taken several times with an air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, in the house of forty years, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in the chest, in the arm and arm.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve life-threatening risks, and the police asked witnesses.
Sissoms and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong sysmosis and tsunami that reached the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, referred to the authorities, hoping that the number of dead could increase.
With the broken communications, the adventurers were unable to obtain any information from the Donganga region, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude system 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghea, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the sysmosis and tsunami occurred.
Dondéna is a region that extends more than 300 km from the coast, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status below a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Donganga.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morouli, on the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donghea have been reached by tsunamis several times in the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghea.
A tsunami also reached the western part of Donghea in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Sysmic Fire Anel, and is regularly reached by sysmos.
These are some of the main sympathies and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong sysmism on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ache, north of Sumatra, originated a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226.000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong sysmos reached the western coast of Sumatra, at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nile Island, along Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude of 6.8 reached the south of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude system 7.6 reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude system 7.5 reached one of the Isle of Mentawai, along Sumatra, depolating a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep syssim reached the Pidie Jaya region, in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among the people who remembered the destruction caused by the deadly sysom and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the roofs of the buildings.
2018: Great sysmos reached the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The six destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.

At least 384 people died following a system that reached the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude symmetry 7.5 originated a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical networks and communications were cut, hoping that the number of deaths would rise in the next few days.

Ministry of Public Affairs demands a rare capital penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
The Ministry of Public Affairs of New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a truck located by Home Depot to launch an attack in October, in a cycle in West Side Highway, in the Manhattan Bay, attacking peas and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims "intendedly" and infected "intendedly" serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, recorded in the South-East York area.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder to the service of organized crime, usually used by the Ministry of Public Service in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack called for a "considerable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as "atroz, cruel and wrongful".
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," the report said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, New York's South Zone did not ask for the death penalty for an accusation.
The river, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug dealers, but the punishment was committed to eternal prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying acts in favour of the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, of the nature of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate any delays in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hang ISIS's flag in the hospital's room, he referred to the police.
It was declared innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defence attorneys, said they were "of course disappointed" with the decision of the accused.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction of guilt for eternal imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously asked the accused not to ask for the death penalty.
The Conservative Member states that NIGEL Farage should lead Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today "mobilising the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former leader of the UKIP said that politicians should "press the pressure" of the Euroscetians, while one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Officer Peter Bone stated in the play of Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage was a Brexit Minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile its deeply divided coral reefs was highlighted by conservationists who defend the sustainability, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The first Minister has discussed maintaining his commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, facing attacks by the Brexit parties, the Permanent Defence Forces and the EU.
The allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, urging the Euroscetics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the Caos.
Mr. Bone said at the beginning of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "get over with the Plan".
It suggested that Farage should have been entrusted with responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would've already gone," he said.
Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we should finish with the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be supplanted.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
He rejected the allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people changed ideas and intended to remain is completely lost".
The defender of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to journalists: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is imputable to the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is imputable in our own party and among the militias who take the campaigns to the street and who we owe our election.
Let the Chequers Plan fall and begin to hear."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, he added: "Only the first ministers who can keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "sent the pressure" if they prefer to bring the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to bring Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not going to know about it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to pressure our political class, which is about to bring Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-government United Kingdom."
However, the defenders left in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour workshop in the city centre.
A large number of activists posted posts with the message "Conservatives against the Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The representative of the Workers in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application in the opening of the convention.
"These are the people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'More Canada', for the unlimited border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete phrase.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren planned to "assist" the possible candidate to the President
North American Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "assist the candidate to the President" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual criticism of President Donald Trump, is invited to re-election in November against Republican President Geoffrey Diehl, co-mandator of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Sunday afternoon event in Holyoke was your 36th meeting with the electors in the form of a debate since Trump's possession.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to apply to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to correct our government's problems and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest under the murder of Wade Sims, of LSU Tigers
The baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Wade Sims, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was kidnapped near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a shot at his head, following which he ended up in jail," said the reporters on Saturday the chief of police Murphy J. Paul, according to the 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was raised by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted his presence at the site, imputing a weapon, acknowledging that he had raised Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without showing resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police team.
Sims, a June of 1.98 meters created in Baton Rouge, discussed 32 games and was titled 10 times in the past, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel in the team order
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders in Mercedes played a central role in the race.
Out of the field position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind to defend his position in the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the traffic at the end of the flight, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes was at the boxes a little later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed it after a retraced scan, after which Ferrari's pilot had temporarily left the inside of the free track, at risk of decalculation after a double correction of the trajectory to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen came out of the last line of the grid and found himself in the seventh place at the end of the first time, on the day of his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race, switching a lot later on pneus, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, with a view to crossing Kimi Raikkonen to finish in a fourth place.
He finished coming to the boxes at 44th time but could not improve his rhythm in the last eight times, which enabled Raikkonen to finish in the room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job throughout the weekend and was a real horseman, letting me pass it.
The team did an extraordinary job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump raciliated Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because of his insinuency that he would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in the West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the Ford witness before the Senate Justice Commission, noting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last days, see the anger, see how people are more, malicious and false," said Trump.
"When we see the information refugees and the media and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, is she running away from you?
Remember the answer to her... did you publish the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, let's wait there.
The escape departed from us... no, we didn't go," added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the flight occurred at the beginning of September, but he vowed that the flight would have taken place from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to be confidential and I respected her request."
But his disappointment did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday evening session: "You know that more, this was a bad body language.
It may not have been her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the term for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to withdraw power by resorting to all means.
We see the evil, the misery, no matter who can reach, who must take the power and control," the President said, according to the Mediate.

Aerial controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from symbiosis
An Indonesian air controller has been arrested as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers was safely decoyed.
More than 800 people died and many continued to disappear after a strong sysmosis had reached the island of Sulawesi on Friday, originating in a tsunami.
Replications continue to absorb the region, leaving many residents buried in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues had fled to save himself, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his position while the control tower collapsed violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained focused on ensuring that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was then on the track, was safely decoyed.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, in front of the huge shell.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian air navigation agency's spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, announced the Australian television chain ABC News.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he spoke this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated with this news," he added.
However, the authorities have accepted that the number of deaths can reach thousands, referring to the disaster management agency of the country whose access to the cities of Donghea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the holes that we have not yet been able to rescue," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting assistance and maintenance for the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute there's a couple of ampoules with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
The mini-marketers are being beaten all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is on a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he went to the local military forces and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was reached by six men who took over 550 lives.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after the plane crash in the lake
The air carrier responsible for the aircraft that emerged in a lake in Micronesia, Pacific, reports now that a man disappeared after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane to land.
In a communication, Air Niugini stated that he could not confirm the paradise of a male passenger from Saturday to evening.
The company said it was working with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane had landed in the water by attempting to land in the Chuuk Island Airport.
The official bodies stated that seven people had been hospitalized on Friday.
The airline progressed that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical framework.
We still do not know what the cause of the loss was or the exact sequence of the events.
The U.S. airline and Marine company were united in stating that the plane could not reach the track and landed in the lake.
Some witnesses thought the plane was out of track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane came very low.
"It was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others had been able to drag himself with the water by the belt and get to the emergency exits of the plane to sink.
He told me that the board assistants had gone into panic and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, seafarers who were working on an improvement work on a mollusc in the vicinity also helped rescue the ship to transport people to land before the plane was 30 metres (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with air companies registered in PNG, but no one involved Air Niugini.
Analystist explains the chronology of the night's events in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new judgment of a man accused of smoking a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours in the field of information analysis.
He described on the jury how he used the phone records to rebuild the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that her cell phone was with Chambers at the time she said she had been with her friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford testified on the Sabbath and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in his car that night, Sanford said he was lying because the car was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
The mobile records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis turned off SMS messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' mobile.
"He caught her alive," said Hale.
The defence should begin to present its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin to be analysed by the jury at the end of that day.

Another black one?!
Love of New York marriage process for dispatch through a "racist" text message
A love of New York is processing a marriage by discriminatory disposition after having received a mother's text message in an attempt to complain that "it was more black".
The marriage took the charges of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, showed some anxiety when she found out that the new love Giselle Maurice was ready when this was presented for her first day of work in 2016.
"There's no CRER..." wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to the husband, he sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he appeared from his pocket, a "buffed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Giselle Maurice saying the bad performance of the former African-American love and that he was waiting for a Philippines love.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and was sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the marriage and asking for a payment of $350 per day for the period of six months for which he had been elected without contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be stupid," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The marriage rejected the allegations of racism, saying that disseminating Giselle was perfectly logical since they received no confidence in her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent him something he really didn't mean to say.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"They would trust your children to someone who has treated you badly?
Is your son born recently?
I don't believe it."
When applying the "extortion" process, Plasco said that his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue someone like that?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
As the legal process unfolds, the court of the public opinion was censored to condemn marriage in the social networks, criticising its conduct and reasoning.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's editors received that readers could not identify themselves with a talking mouse
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put us in someone's skin that read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small urge to play writing the child book, would not have taken the pity if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had been a great pleasure given its fall in the past year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," said that the father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a man given to gambling," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we were proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think it was the way you did Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington's own."
My daughter was dying and I had to get off the phone.
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been taken in an emergency to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors went on their way to save her life.
"I didn't call friendly to say that the situation was even worse and that there were no chances of survival," said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to give up on me.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given you to keep your heart functioning were slow to stop making an effect and get out of your system.
I've been dead for a while, and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to tell you."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now struggling with the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers loyal to the test for what was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I always wanted my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that felt a great compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women of Love Offer Cartoons on Bridge to Avoid Squads
Two women who lost loved ones who had been murdered fought to prevent others from walking the same way.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have provided cards in a gallery bridge with mobile messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he died.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old resident in Lydney, said that the son was a chief promiser with a contagion smile.
"She was known for her smile.
They all said they were lighting the room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he had been "blowed in the darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the posters "to know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, or who is a friend.
They don't close up on you. They have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-term friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after the death of the soror.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed," he said.
"One day before Christmas we noticed a change in their behavior.
The day of Christmas, it was a trap, when the boys opened up the present, and he didn't even look at them."
He said his death had traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to go through: "Drive a family.
No one will be indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in play with the start of FBI research
"I thought that in terms of what it looked like - a time- and-range investigation - we could be more united," said Jeff Flake on the Sabbath, fearing that the commission would be "demoroning" facing a united party.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your revolution is just a matter of time.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to choose their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to force them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom she met Ashley, the personal secretary of Bush at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to vote out and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korea deserts decreased during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters to North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong's rise to power seven years ago.
In citing data from the Ministry of the Union of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 deserts occurred last year compared with 2706 of 2011.
Park stated that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people's opponents ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public statement.
General rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korea deserters.
Only stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go by China, which has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than the strongly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal and non-refugees, and it is often repatriated.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that were held in an atmosphere.
The discussions took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on the Sabbath, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North-Korean, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is historical and inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in Camera, said that Brett Kavanaugh, who was a candidate for the Supreme Court, was historically and temporarily inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, she would soon be called history," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate's Judicial Commission on Friday
Kavanaugh emotionally hired all the sexual abuse links to Dr.a Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional opening, sometimes in a loud and clear voice, talking about his family and school years.
He also explicitly accused the Committee's Democrats, calling for the allegations made against him of "mortem and conspiracy murder" organized by liberal candidates by Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that Kavanaugh's witness proves that there are no conditions for serving in the Supreme Court because of its preconceived attitude against the Democrats.
"I think that he was disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
When he was asked if he would try to impose the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won most of the Chamber of Representatives, Pelosi went away.
"What I can say is that lying to Congress or the FBI does not gather the conditions for being in the Supreme Court, nor even for serving in its current court," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge in the Court of Justice of the Circumscription of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he received potential views from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (but best known by Obamacare) or the case of Roe vs Wade, given the popularity of being a conservative judge.
During the hearings of confirmation, Kavanaugh asked questions about the possibility of coming to reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to choose a historical and preconceived person for the Supreme Court and to wait for us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control emotions.
It's a justified diaphragm, months and years of fatigue to cross, and it can't be debashed without crying.
"We're looking at us," said Mr. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive job in a company helped me so much. She told me that she also cried when she was crying, but she had created a technique. When she was crying and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to "I don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm hungry."
And he kept on.
And I thought for myself... it's brilliant." continued Mr. Steinem.
The tears are accepted when expressing anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly that, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which there was an unexpressable rage, being waited by the eye by an older woman--a friendly no-one who threatened me a little--and literally dragged to the steps to hear say
"You never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy because they've been able to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the Democratic Congressional date of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her application for presidentials.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-conjugal relationship on the board of a ship called Monkey Business and resigned from the application, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply for herself to the presidentials.
"It wasn't a very weighted decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates and another one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who appealed to the situation of "The White of Snow and the Seven Years."
Given his late income, the fund-raising was almost as desirable and he swore that he would only be able to earn $2 million in the race.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He discovered that some of his sympathetics only gave him $250, although they had given him $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - thanks to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fund-raising and makes the message to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears rose.
"Even he seemed depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder when talking about the reaction of the media.
"I'd have thought Klenex was my business sponsor.
What were they supposed to write in my epitaph now?
"She's sick?"
Like the U.S. trade war and China can be beneficial to Pequim
The first rescue of the U.S. trade war and China was overwhelming, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the eyes of experts, the separation of the two countries can be beneficial for Pequim for a long time.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when important Chinese imports involving solar, steel and aluminium panels were taxed.
This week was marked by a significant increase in the situation with the new rates to affect goods at the value of $200 billion (150 billion) and taxing half of all goods sent by China to the U.S.A.
Pequim has always criticized the same currency, rising rates of 5 to 10 per cent for North-American goods at the value of $60 billion.
China committed itself to following the steps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be vaccinated in the near future.
Making Washington withdrawing would mean subjugating the demands, but showing public service to the U.S. would be too burdensome for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Pequim makes good use of its trunks, the pressures imposed by the U.S. war can sustain China for a long time by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that a temporary political decision of Washington or Beijing can result in a economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia in the Center for New American Security, a group of reflection.
Minister for Foreign Affairs says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in rebuilding a country destroyed for more than seven years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists have destroyed to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that left behind due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily life and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who remained in the country needed humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would receive good aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he said that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that were sponsoring the revolution.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Selection beats the U.S. and wins Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive cuts in Europe alone since they won Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe will again be victorious after the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost all the tournaments, stopped the run-up tea for water in box 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the most classified player of the European Selection, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The most well-classed player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England in which he may have been his last participation in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I can't tell.
It was a difficult year.
I can't stop thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy for having won the Tata.
It was all a team effort and I am happy that I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who destroyed the North American golf course, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for having defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up to see him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Involving statistical values of one of the biggest players of all time with 14 great winning titles and just hit by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed for reaching the fairway.
The North American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the determinant performance of his team. "I admire them. They fought.
This morning, we were able to put some fear in Europe.
Let's fight.
My parabens to Thomas.
It's a big captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
Let's reorganize ourselves and I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to continue.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat to another team.
They were better."
