Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to "go to maps"
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a lack of willingness to accept the proposal for the appointment of an abbreviator to the MWP (from the Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Parliament of Wales).
The problem decision relates to plans to amend the name of the Assembly of Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible shortcomings in this observatory.
One of the librarians, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new librarians “refuses Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: on the Wally twp means "tupica", and pwp is "kakaska".
According to a member of the Assembly of the Party of Wales, his organization was “not satisfied” and offered other options.
The representatives of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new observatory, but note that MWP is close to writing the word Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w is produced in the Welsh language as a letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing a draft Law on the Exchange of Names, made the following statement: “The final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly, of course, remains after them.”
The Wales National Assembly Act of 2017 authorized it to change its name.
In June, the Committee had published the results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options, according to which the House of Wales, rather than the Assembly, had received extensive support from the local population.
With regard to the names of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of the House of Wales” (Wellsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the option was given the highest public support by the MWP.
At the same time, the members of the Assembly have proposed other options, but the President, Elina Johns, will simply find a challenging solution to all decisions, and we remember that the draft amendment law must be submitted within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other amendments to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the system of the Committee.
Members of the Assembly shall vote for the final version of their appointment during the legislative debate.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on their country's change of name
In the wake of the resurrection, Macedonians are voting on the country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The international vote is called for to allow for a multi-year dispute with a neighbor of Greece in which its province of Macedonia is located.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” assumes territorial claims in the Greek province and has repeatedly been opposed to the entry into force of its northern neighbour in Eurojust and NATO.
President George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, stated that his results would not be recognized.
However, the referendum party, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, notes that the change in the country's name is the total price of entry into the EU and NATO.
Harlem income crisis: always shut down St. Martin's neck
“The older areas I met said that earlier on each corner was on the bar and on the church,” Adams relates.
“And now there is no remaining one.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of society has changed.”
“The bar stopped being the kind of guest of the whole area where they came regularly.”
As for the Church, it is concerned that the means of sale of assets are limited to what their leaders may have given them. They will either be left behind or be left behind.
At the place of the church, he added, there will be a multi-quartered house where residents will not be able to support those who remain in the area of income.
“Most of the buyers of these rooms will be white,” Adams says. “And this is about the day when such churches are finally closed, because new neighbours will never be their guests.”
Both churches were formed by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin was ten years later.
The first arrivals of the Methodist Church were abandoned in the 30th century.
Their building was purchased by a black house with a neighbor.
When St. Martina's church passed into the hands of the black community, she led a similar man, John Howard Johnson, who organized a shop fight on 125th Street, the main commercial art of Harlem, where they refused to accept work or improve their service.
In 1939 a fire caused significant damage to the building, and during the restoration work, Johnson’s father ordered the establishment of a carillion.
Similar to David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who changed him into the head of St. Martin’s church, he proudly referred to the Charylon as “cocks for the poor. ”
But the expert, who tried the carillion in July, called it “cultural heritage” and “one historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that, in the first place in the world, Saint Martin was the first tool to play in the world by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger career in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriots, St. Martin's church has not been replaced yet.
During the last few months of St. Martin’s church, a complex situation arose with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by worldly church leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
The gathering of the remnant, the governing body of the income of the world's leaders in July, turned to the Eparhia, concerned that the Eparchi ' trying to transfer the value of the work to the congregation, although the latter had no regard for the election of the architects and contractors sent by Epachi.
The lack of transparency on the part of the European Union has been some of the causes.
In California, a 13-year-old miner, the miner of the Lobsters
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobbying season, 13-year-old boy in California was attacked by sharks and suffered physical injuries.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. from the Bikon Beach beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel told at the KSWB-TV station (San-Diego), he met his friends on Saturday morning, and for about half an hour, he heard a boy crying for help.
According to Hammela, he began to decide that the boy was very happy with the lobester’s smile, but soon he realized that he cried “I’ve been listening!
I have heard it!"
Under the influence of the needle, Hammel noted that “he had completely torn his skin around the key”.
“I called for all of them to be chosen from the water, ‘Aquala here!’” says Hammel.
The boy was brought to the Reed Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The kind of shark that hits a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Gailz, told the press that a few weeks ago, a shark had been detected in this place, but it did not lead to dangerous sights.
Gailz also added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the area of the upper floor.
The representatives of the authorities closed the zone from the Panto beach in Casablade to the Swami beach in Ensinitas, for 48 hours to conduct investigations and ensure the safety of the population.
Gailz noted that there are 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to submit to the United Kingdom perfume-cosmetic market
Seinsberi is going to set up cosmetics and perfumes units in Butts, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetic consultants, according to the model of luxury universes.
The U.S. Parfumemer-Cosmetic Market is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of stellings and continues to grow, while in the area of fashion and goods for domestic sales they fall. For the sake of a significant share of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country, space departments of cosmetics and perfumes will be presented, and in the event of success in many other shops next year should be expected.
The owners of supermarkets will seek to fill the fields that were previously released under television, microwave ovens, household goods, and investment in the perfume-cosmetic market.
According to the representatives of Seinsberi, it is planned to increase the two assortment of cosmetic products to 3,000 names, including the first ones to be proposed such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing assortment of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented to a greater extent, in specific locations, by the type of organization of goods in the Butts stores.
In addition, a business line of "Botik-Cosmetics" will be reorganized with the transition to vegan products in order to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Seinsberi stores will be represented by the Chinese perfume producer Fragrance Shop: the first one has already been opened in Croatia in south London last week, and the second one is expected to be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small quantity of products every day in small shops soon from home led to the fact that supermarkets were forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Kup, President Seinsbury, says that the planes will gradually turn into the universe, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers in the competitive fight against retail shops, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Hundreds of Seinsberi supermarkets are located at Argos Airports, some of which are now available to the Habitats store since the network acquired two years ago, resulting in increased sales of food goods and publications through these purchases.
Previous attempts to give the supermarket a new life to its cosmetic and aesthetic departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, Seinsberi and Butts were organized, but further differences arose between participants in the income division from the sale of patents in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinsberi pharmaceutical business (all 281 stores) by Selesio, the owner of Lloyds Farmasi network, for 125 million pounds of stellings three years ago.
It is expected that Lloyds will support the implementation of the plan, adding a broad line of luxury care facilities for La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Seinsbury, says: "We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetic offices to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited special trained consultants who will always be ready to assist the Council.
Our brand assortment of any taste, pleasant design, and the convenient availability of shops will attract many visitors to cosmetics and perfumes, which will be a completely new concept of shopping".
Peter Jones responded to Holly Willowby's 11 million pounds of styrling
Logovo Dragon star Peter Johns "scared" by Holly Willowby's telephony deal at 11 million pounds of stelling, which she had intended to conclude with Peter's Lifstal brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their common brand of home clothes and accessories, Truly.
This couple's business was compared to the Goop actress's brand of Gwent Peltro.
The 37-year-old “Ettim tomorrow” management programme announced its decision in Instagram.
The decision of Holly Willowby to leave their legacy of lifstal brand to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV led to the spread of Peter Jones, the star of God's dragon.
According to our sources, Johns was "discovered", when a TV lovers at a pressing meeting held on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlou, Bakinghamshire, admitted that after the conclusion of the new contracts, up to 1.5 million of them had no time left for their common brand of home clothes and accessories of Truly.
Their mark was compared to the child's actress Gwent Peltrou Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double the state of Willowby, estimated at 11 million pounds of stelling.
The 37-year-old leader announced his treatment in Instagram, and Johns himself left Britain on a private plane for one of his own volleyballs.
As one source reports, "Mark Truly was the main priority of Holly.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure its safe existence for the next few decades.
Its decision led to the conclusion of all parties to the transaction.
They were all shocked by what happened on Tuesday, since the weeks they had been counted before the start of the mark.
The headquarters in Marlow remains the entire warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that one of the most popular stars of Great Britain's " Etim tomorrow" treatment can be covered by a company in millions of Starling Pounds due to significant inputs into goods: from the shower and candle to the clothing, as well as the potential delay of the line.
In addition, it is about breaking up old friendships.
The three children of Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been dating Johns and his wife, Taro Cap, for ten years.
Willowby set up a brand Truly with Taro Cap in 2016, and Tari, 52-year-old Peter Jones, took the lead in the company in March.
Both couples often leave together, and in addition, Johnso has 40 per cent of the shares of Dana Baldwina.
Willowby will become a M&S brand and replace Anthony Macparttlin as the lead translator of the ITV “I – Significance”.
The source from nearby Jones said last night, "We cannot comment on his business".
"And then we loved each other"
He sought out a criticism that was criticized by the media because of the “inappropriate president” comment and the positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Tramp refuse such claims?
He said Trump, echoing the voice of the leading news.
"I did not give up."
He noted that Kim Chen Yin was interested in the reconvened meeting, after Trap called their first summit in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing the stocks of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been in vain.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, high-level North Korean diplomat Li John Ho spoke to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still awaiting “responsible responses” from the United States after the initial disarmament measures of the CDC.
Instead, the United States has noted a diplomat, which continues to use sanctions as a string of pressure.
During the meeting of its supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation is remarkable in North Korea”, he said.
“We were at the border with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a wonderful relationship."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yun brought fruit: the end of the rocket tests had been completed, prisoners had been released, and American military personnel in the territory of the CNDD had also returned to their families.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Chen Yun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was nothing strange.
“Bring yourself like the president so simply, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street, who are in this whole dead room, there would be 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing at the crowd before him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: marked disaster destructions, victims are estimated by hundreds
On the first day after the earthquake that struck Lombok, the foreign NGOs said that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombo were left with head injuries, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was mandatory for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they clearly understood that international support was not needed, so it was not easy,” explains Selina Sambong.
The Children's Peace Organization is preparing a team to go to Palu, but we still don't know if a foreign group will be able to work on site.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Administration for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, Indonesia assessed the situation in Palo to determine the relevance of the involvement of international organizations.
In view of the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continues to be badly prepared for natural disasters.
Although roofs were built in Ache, they are rarely found on other coastal lines.
Despite the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren to warn the people that, most likely, the victims were so numerous.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is difficult enough even in a good time.
Stoic disasters are becoming more and more a challenge to logistics.
The former hospital in Lombok to assist land victims is located in Palu, but the road to the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has strengthened the strong infrastructure of Indonesia by focusing on its pre-election campaign and has spent considerable resources on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, which was flying for a new period of time next year, has been in trouble with funding.
The President also criticises the expansion of the interconfessional influence between the conservative majority of Muslims in Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were left behind as a result of a link between Christians and Muslims, armed swords, rifles, and other suicides.

Mr. Cromwell's memory before Parliament's construction led to a heated discussion on the "repetition of history"
“Exemption” Cromwell would be a reward for the destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memory Society called Mr. Krika's proposal "summashesty" and "the attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “In the context of the ongoing debate on the origin of historic monuments, the question of the status of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Court has been raised.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the economic movement during the English civil war.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell suffers for the sins of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
The great statue of Cromvel of Sir William Hamo Tornnikrovt reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many consider to be worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell the protector of the parliament from outside pressure, in his case a monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate, it remains the subject of expert debates.
But it can be confirmed with conviction that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve high assessments and respect.”
The Chinese farmer's death burned the pig-killer
In one of the South-West China markets, the farmer became a victim of swine, reports local media.
The victim's body (in the IMI only referred to as his name, “Yuan”), with a broken artery, was found on the market in the province of Luupanšu, in southern China, and reported to the Morning Post in the resurrection.
Swinov is ready to introduce pigs to the pigyard, 30 May 2005, in the province of Sinin, China.
Yuan and his twin brother came from the neighboring province of Yuan and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the brother discovered that Yuan’s body was unconscious, and the door was opened to the neighboring priest.
There was a huge red - blooded chicken in the kitchen.
During the trial trial, it was found that the swine fever increased by 250 kilograms to the farmer's death.
“ My brother’s legs were broken and torn, ” said the newspaper Guiyang Evening News, a victim’s relative.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to torture his animals.
The body was found about the time of the fall.
The Swindler didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was isolated in a separate prison during the investigation in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administration on compensation for the death of the farmer.
Cases involving pigs in people's lives are not uncommon.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., a heavy traumatized man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kilograms of animal was dragged by a whale creatinine into the tractor and left only by a successful woman.
In 2012, a case was recorded when a farmer from Oregon, U.S., was accompanied by his own pigs. As CBC News, one Canadian farmer, told CBC News, pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can operate on their secret aggression as a "suspending mechanism".
"The pig's games,
They're cute and they're very nice, but they don't have a purpose to try you.
You should just bring your feelings to your attention and to your dignity."
Uragan Rosa will bring olives to a large part of the South-West United States
According to the forecast, hurricane Rosa loses its power by moving through a more colder zone to the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring olive oil and water into the territory of North Mexico and the South West United States.
As of Saturday, 5 hours ago in New York City, the cycle reached the 1st category of winds up to 135 km/h, which is 360 km south-west of the city of Punta Euhenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north in the resurrection.
At the same time, the Pacific begins to form a low-pressure zone, which will move east to the west coast of the United States.
More than 25 cm of seats are expected on Monday in Mexico.
As a result of the tropical drought falling in the emerging low-pressure zone, strong elephants are expected to be in the near future in the South West.
The ranges from 2.5 to 10 cm are the result of dangerous evaporation, gravitational flows and possible uses in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to the high tropical humidity of the air, the rate of drought can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the South-West United States, most of the territory of Arizona, up to 5-10 cm is expected.
It is not excluded from the risk of sudden expeditious flooding due to the inequitable distribution of tropical rainforests.
If there is a risk of a tropical lion walking in the desert, there are serious consequences.
Lions can turn cannons into stormy rivers, and the town can pull out the cold winds and lift the dust.
With the rise of low-pressure zones on the southern California coast, lions are breaking down.
It is possible that up to 1.5 cm of sequentials can cause small cross-sectional flows and create narrow surfaces on the roads.
These are the first cuts since the beginning of the season of rain in the region.
In the evening of the resurrection and in the morning of the Monday in Arizona, tropical rains will flow over other territories until Monday and Tuesday evening.
On Tuesday, the lions will go into the area of four angles and extend to the evening.
In October, the United States will be monitored for high temperatures due to low air temperature in Arctic with sufficient high temperatures in tropical areas.
Such a combination sometimes leads to a strong change in temperature in a small territory.
Such high temperatures will be particularly noticeable in the central part of the United States in the resurrection.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Missori) and Omahe (Nebresca), as well as between St. Louis and De-Muns (Iyova), there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer camp will be attacked and spread to other territories.
In most central and eastern parts of the United States, temperatures are expected early in October, and temperatures will reach 27 degrees south-east of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, up to 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast of time is promising a very unlikely high temperature on the east coast of the United States before mid-October.
Senate hearings by Judge Bretta Kavano have seen more than 20 million observers
The statements of Bretta Cavano and Christina Blazi Ford, who accused Kavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew attention to more than 20 million viewers of six televisions on Thursday.
The political opposition in the area of the Kavano candidate's approval received an unexpected continuation, and a urgent communication was made on Friday in the media: the Republican Jeff Fleek provided that a lawyer's prosecution was investigated by the FBI within a week.
As stated by the Forum at the hearings before the Legal Committee of Senat, it was determined by “100 per cent” that Kavano was attacked and tried to divorce her at school.
Cavano gave emotional evidence, stating that 100 per cent had been convinced that it had not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the five-year debate was viewed by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account the average statistical data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are still available.
Moreover, Nielsen's rating does not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
For comparisons, it's about the middle auditor following the mother of the American football club in the play-off or the Oskar holding ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leading firemen supported the appointment of Kavano: Senate hearings throughout the day were seen by 5.69 million viewers, reported by the Nielsen Agency.
The second is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS auditors accounted for 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2,52 million exams, reports Nielsen.
After listening to the matter, we don't get tired.
On Friday, this drama was played by Jeff Fleyk.
After a senator from Arizona, who was considered a moderated Republican, reported his intention to support Kavano's application, CNN and CBS telephonies were able to press on the camera, as Flake met on Friday on the occasion of the meeting of the Legal Committee with a group of activists who had been critical of the senator.
The whole world saw, as he left his eyes, getting rid of the women who had been wounded in a direct CNN ephere.
Said one of them, 'I am standing before you.'
Do you think that he is telling the truth?
“You have the strength, at the same time as so many women,” they tried to explain their position.
Flyk replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and that he was speaking on the subject at the Committee meeting, and the doors of the elevator were closed, hiding the senator from the cameras.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve Kavan's application for a post of judges and send it to the Senate in a general vote, all the channels were transpired into a direct ephere.
However, Fleek provided one condition — the investigation by the FBI of the allegations against the candidate for the following week, as the democratic minority was obtained.
Flyk claims that he has changed his opinion through the involvement of another senator from the Democrats of Chris Kunssa.
He made a final decision, talking to Kuns and several other senators.
The decision of the Flyka had an effect, as it was evident that the Republicans were not able to vote for Kavan without an investigation.
By order of President Trampa FBR, the investigation of the charges had been conducted in Kavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses her critics of “political games” in the context of the situation with Bressito
In an interview on Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the Euro-Union, as they were disproportionately interested in the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published in one field with the May interview, the former head of MID Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Shashki plan within Brazil, saying that it considered the customs messages between Britain and the EU to be “very bad”.
The death of Wade Sims in the shooting: The police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the murder of the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a man suspected of killing a 20-year-old basketballist who was playing at the University of Louisiana.
As reported by the baton-Ruja police, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and detained for the second time.
The police published video clips with the participation of Sims and Simpson, where Sims lost his eyes.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police discovered the DNA Simpson on the sights found at the crime scene.
During the investigation, Simpson admitted that Wyad had been killed.
According to the Advocate release, Simpson had a deposit of $350,000.
The East Coast Coroner of Baton-Russia issued a preliminary conclusion on Friday: death was caused by a massive combined fire wound of the sword and head.
The Division is grateful to the Department of Criminal Investigation of the State of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the South University Police and the local residents who have assisted in carrying out operational and research activities that have resulted in detention.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the rule of law for their "good work for the sake of the offender".
Simsu was 20 years old.
The two-metre Forvard was the teacher of Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played in the command of the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, Sims picked 5.6 shots and made 2.6 rounds in the middle of the match.
The trainer, Will Way, made a statement on Friday morning, said that the tragic death of Wade Sims called “sock” and “current” in all games.
"That's what I'm always afraid of," added the trainer.
The volcanic eruption in Mexico
Volcano Popocapetel buried the palm of the southern coast of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Natural Disasters, Mexico, recommended that the population not be close to the volcano: the activity was registered in its courtyard and 183 parasitic emissions were made.
According to the Center, close to the volcano, sin was often spread and drug abuse was felt.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social networks users have posted photos of truck lobe skeletals covered with thin cloth.
After the earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which struck the central part of Mexico in September 2017, the geophysics seized the participating volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popocapetel (or, for his "Don Goo") is an active volcano since 1994.
Police placement with Catalan separatists prior to the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, the first anniversary of the referendum on the departure of Spain from Spain from two camps was held without any interference between the parties to autonomy and the police; six participants were detained.
Police officers relieved the protestors of independence, and as the last ones dressed in black masks, they forgot to keep the eggs and the prairie, raising the cloud of dark dust in the centre of Barcelona itself.
After the police left the door to stop the mob, the order was renewed with a new force.
For a number of hours, the people of the party were wont to say: We shall not forget, nor shall we be sorry. And their opponents answered: "Peace be to Spain!"
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were burned at the hospital with mild injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the departure of Catalan from Spain, recognized by the illegal Spanish Government, but was important to the separatists.
Catalonia with a large movement voted for the departure of Spain, but the evidence was low because the opposition to the exit was significantly boycotted by the referendum.
According to the Catalan official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured during the past year when police tried to block the referendum in the electoral areas of the country.
On Friday, the separatists engaged in the alleged follow-up of the demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to interfere with its operation.
The demonstration was all the same, but it went the other way.
The 68-year-old electric Narciss Termes, visiting separatists in his wife's company, is focusing on the hope of acquiring the Catalion of sovereignty.
“One of the most important events in our lives has happened last year.
My parents cried out with joy, had the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a position to be raised," he says.
In recent December elections, the local authorities of the Spanish office of the Catholic Party have won a significant victory, even with a small explosion, but this year their movement has lost its supporters, since many of the leading leaders are either in refugee or under guard, waiting for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, 42-year-old mechanic, writing on the phone matching in support of the police, said that the conflict was fueled by both sides of the political spectrum.
He added, "It is a great shock."
On Saturday, Oriol Junckeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, at the end of the last year in the pre-trial detention chamber, announced his intention to fly to the European Parliament next year.
"Participation in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Government of Spain," he said.
Londoners: The car has fallen into the house, all three of the participants have been arrested
One of the houses in Londonbury was several times owned by a car; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The tour was completed on Thursday about 19:30 at local time in the Balinagard Crecent area.
As a result of the riot, the police officer Bob Bloomings reported that the building was damaged.
There's a report that the car could have been made of a fire.
Livingstone's victory over Rangers thanks to Mangy's bullet.
The first goal of Dolly Mangy was to win a guaranteed victory for the Livingstone team.
Thanks to the murder of Livingstone, he won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the chief coach of the Scottish Club, Steven Gerard, this is the second floor of 18 games.
The direct attack by Dolly Mangy was compared to the command of Gary Holt with the Hibernian Club in the accounting table where they were second-placed.
The Gerard Club remained unconquered in the Premier League season, and in the resurrection they met with the leaders of the Harts group, from which the Rangers remained on eight o'clock.
On Thursday, Rangers will take part in their field of the League of Europe with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club has continued its inexhaustible series in the division, played six tours, and has not received any injuries since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the commander of the team.
Leaved moments for Livingstone in the presence of guests
Colporteurs should have been informed from the very beginning that the Rangers had obviously not been able to cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of protection, but his weak attempt failed.
The host party allowed Rangers to play in front of their protection line, counting at dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's what they did and missed this important goal.
The Rangers were released, and Livingstone used the opportunity: Declan Gallager and Robinson were transferred to Menge, who had been killed by the central regime.
At that point, Rangers was superior to the sword, but the protection of the host team was unwarranted, so the returnor, Liam Kelly, was not concerned.
The second time, the same scheme continued, although Kelly was still under attack from Alfredo Morelos.
The Kingners, Mr. Allen McGregor, took the sword from Scott Pittman, and Litgo made a broad reference to the standard.
The sword has always fallen into Livingstone’s script, but all the attacks have been exposed, and the two requirements of the panels — one for the fun of Glenna Midlothon Halket and the other for the game — have not been satisfied.
"Fenomenal" game "Livingstone" — Analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, report to the "Toni Macaroni Arena" stadium
A financial game and a great result for the Livingstone team.
All the games were absolutely great and, on a certain occasion, all the expectations continued to arise on the football Olympics.
Their style of game and composition has not changed in practice since they came from their origin to the top of the ratings, and the great reward of Coach Holt has been that he has made this team mobile.
There were not any of these heroes in his command.
Captain Halket led a highly organized protection, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Urallo weaken.
At the same time, Rangers could never enter the rhythm.
Although they had good playtimes with trainer Gerard, they did not reason for our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they did not have the power of the sword, but they had only once been protected by the host team.
The cold welcome of Erdogan during a visit to Kelne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the Turkish and German leaders met in the afternoon, there was a wonderful time, and the two superiors were in an excellent position.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO States parties — the visit without any conflict.
I believe that countries have failed to understand such issues as human rights, freedom to print and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Then Erdogan was sent to Keller to attend the ceremony to open a large new memorial.
Kelne lives in the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
With regard to security, the police did not allow a 25-year-old crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters were standing in a distance to see their president.
At the same time, the opposition to the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, were gathered to condemn the Government of Germany in full voice both the Erdogan policy and the decision of the German Government to invite it with a visit to Germany.
The presence of radically opposite points of view at the meeting reflects the substance of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accidents: Motor collision led to the death of a driver
In London, a car broke down with a driver who ended up in an accident.
The accident took place shortly after Bezhid Street and Evelyn Street, a resurfaced in the southeastern part of the town of Depfort, about 10:15 at the local time.
The driver of the car and those who came to the hospital tried to help the driver, but the man did not come to his senses.
This is not the only accident with the death outlet in this area: it's about a mile from the scene on the Chailders Street street, and another passenger was hit by a car that the driver had lost.
The London police report that there is work to be done to establish the identity of the deceased and to inform his close relatives.
As long as the road is closed and the bus is changed, car drivers are asked not to travel in this area.
No orders in Long-Lartin Prison: six police officers injured
According to the Long-Lartin Administration, six police officers were injured during the riots in a man prison.
In a man prison in the harsh LongLardin (Wustershire) regime, the arrangements for the resurrection continue at about 09:30 a.m. on local time.
The “Tornado” group was called for to strike orders involving eight prisoners from one wing.
The police received minor injuries to the soft tissue; medical assistance was provided at the site.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were recruited to permit the incident in the Long-Lartin correctional institution.
Six of them got trauma.
We are categorically ashamed of the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be transferred to the police and their measures of detention may be changed for a longer time.”
There are now more than 500 prisoners in LongLartine, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the media reported that the prison manager had fallen into a hospital and had been attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the prison leadership had been forced to attract a special mission to calm down the imprisoned prisoners who had thrown billions of dollars into the supervisors.
Uragan Rosa can warm up Phenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the dryer territories)
The rice often falls into the area of the intense tropical cycle, but this time it has been “suspended”: at the beginning of the next week, hurricane Rosa made last fish, had to pass over the desert part of South-West and bear the risk of the lion's walnuts.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of the lion's flocks on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and the southern and eastern parts of the state of Nevada, in southern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Uragan Rosa will go straight over Fenix on Tuesday and fall late on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service Office in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of tropical fever or depression, at a distance of 320 km from Fenix since 1950.
Uragan Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest estimates of the National Meteorological Service, there are from 5 to 10 cm of seats, up to 15 cm on the Mogolon-Roman square.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Scalistic Mountains and the Great Bassey, there may be up to 2,5 to 5 cm in length, where the settlements may reach 10 cm.
For the area where the river flows are to the side, the rain caused by the Rose hurricane can be a blessing, as the region has long suffered from drought.
Although the awnings may pose a threat, the desired rains can facilitate the dry season not going to the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory is considered to be at least a heavy burden (the second category of burden)” — reports the website weather.com.
The U.S. U.A. started in the Mexican state of Lower California.
As a wake-up morning, the hurricane, the maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Euhenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Uragan has been in the area with a colder water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its strength.
In the second half of the day, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the "tropic storm" category.
It is expected that in certain regions of Mexico, the presence of popular lions will result in the threat of flooding.
“In the territory of Lower California to the north-west of Sonori, it may fall to 7 to 10 cm, instead of 25 cm,” reports the website weather.com.
The uragan Rosa will be sent north through the territory of Mexico, and early Tuesday morning he will come to the border with Arizona in the tropical cycle, from Arizona to the southern part of the state of Yuta to the evening.
“The main potential risk associated with the hurricane Rose and its remnants associated with the strong lions in Lower California, northwestern Sonor and desert areas of the South-West States”, the National Meteorological Service reports.
It is expected that the cuts will cause dangerous awnings, sanding flows in the desert and possible uses in the mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four suspects were arrested in an attempt to kill
In Somerset, 16-year-olds suffered severe kidney injuries, and three-year-olds and 20-year-olds were suspected of attempted murder.
A victim of severe injuries was found in the Exelsier Terras city of Midsomer Norton about 4 hours a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is considered to be “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstok area, reported to the police in Evon and Somerset district.
The police will search for witnesses of crimes with any video records on the mobile phone.
Donald Tramp: "All hatred, all evil" of democracies have been destroyed in Cavano
“The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote against the cruel and repressive tactics applied by democracy,” Tramp told his colleagues in Wiling, West Virginia.
According to Trampa, in the process of approving the nomination of Kawano for the candidate, “all hatred, all evil” of the Democratic Party has been “conquered. ”
In the United States Congress on Thursday, Cavano gave a speech in which he categorically denied Christina Blazi Ford's accusation that he had been sexually abused more than 30 years ago when they were both adults.
Dr. Ford also provided evidence in the hearing of her complaint.
On Saturday, the president of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class and gender” in Kavano.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kavano is the vote for the approval of one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an unconfirmed public service list,” the president of the group of his colleagues in West Virginia declared.
In his speech, the President had repeatedly raised the question of the appointment of Kavano, referring to the importance of the election of the Republicans at Congress and the Chamber of Representatives.
“For the most important elections in our lives, there are five weeks left.
I do not participate in them, but I do participate in the race in another sense.”
"I'm acting like a hero and I'm fighting for our great candidates."
The tramp believes that democracy has committed itself to the task of “all forces to give us resistance”.
Under the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate on the approval of the Kawano candidate should be held no later than Friday, the Assistant to the High Representative of the Republican Party was informed.
The earthquake in Indonesia has resulted in hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many of whom had been captured by giant waves covering the beaches of the Indonesian island of Solavesi, where the incredible power of tsunamis and earthquakes had been destroyed.
The first victims became hundreds of guests of a beach festival in the city of Palu, and on Friday at the beach, they reached a height of almost six meters, which swept everything on their way and led many of them to the ignominious deaths of the present.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Richter scale.
“When a storm was announced yesterday, people continued to breathe, rather than run away immediately, and thus lost their lives,” said Sutopo Pravo Nugroho, the official representative of the Indonesian National Administration for the Elimination of Natural Disasters at the Jakarta press conference.
“The tsunamis did not come alone, and in the flood of water, cars, roads, homes, and goods destroyed everything on their way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at 497 km/h and all the forces were destroyed on the coast.
Some of those present were taken to the trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 refugee camps in Palu.
Aerophotoses of the management of natural disasters are seen as destroyed houses, warehouses that damaged the bridge and burned.
On Saturday, the coastal city still has underground interpretations.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory with a population of 2.4 million.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake caused the emissions of energy occurred about 200 times more than when the atomic bomb destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunamis may have been stronger than expected, due to the geographical situation of the city at the end of the long river.
Nugroho called the damage “a huge”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Under the ruins of damaged buildings, corpses were found, 540 people were injured, and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and destructions could be even more significant near 300 km from Palu, in the village of Dungal, which was closer to the earthquake.
The communication with Dungal was “completely destroyed, no information has been received”.
“More than 300,000 people live in the Dungal region”, reported in its communiqué of the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been in the disaster zone.
“Trade has occurred, but it has not yet been done,” the report says.
On Saturday, the Office was critical because it did not report the arrival of the tsunamis in Palu, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at the time the initial warning was still in force.
Social networks have shown a loving video where a man on the roof of the building shouts about the rising tsunamis, hoping to attract people to the street.
Within a few minutes, the wall of water was broken down and the entire house and car were destroyed.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authority of this role.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have led to a massive supply of electricity, which has caused the loss of connection in Paul, which has made it very difficult for rescue operations to be carried out.
In Jakarta and other cities, military transportation aircraft were sent with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still did not have the food and items necessary for the first time. Government sources were reported.
The city's airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on the resurrection.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charity came from Dungal to Palu, where staff found shelter in the fireplaces that had been destroyed in their office building. According to Doseb Sinai, they had a terrible picture of total destruction on their way.
“They have seen a great many destroyed houses,” he says.
It's very bad.
Blessed organizations have begun to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many regret that international NGOs have failed to succeed in entering the palace.
Indonesia ' s legislation allows funding, humanitarian assistance and staff of foreign organizations to be invoked only after the site has been declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that there is a local disaster,” reports Aulia Ariani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government announces the natural disaster to the national, we can accept foreign aid, but until the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster, Paul, his friends and relatives, who were missing, still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will bring the people of faith in the best possible way.
On Saturday, a small boy was saved in a canalized hole.
In the resurrection, rescuers pulled out of under the clouds of a woman’s building, who spent two days there, surrounded by her mother’s breathless body.
Hendon Subandano, the National Assembly of Indonesia's parapolarism trainer, prepared two of the missing pilots to a recent Asian game in Indonesia.
Among the others who had fallen into a trap in the Roa Roa Room were his disciples, including Mandela.
"I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive," he said.
He recalls how, after learning of the breach of Roa Roa Roa's house by other parapolanists, he had been desperately trying to contact his colleagues at the beach festival for the next hours.
However, his messages were displayed with one serious stick, not two holes.
“This means that the reports have not been delivered.”
Arrears of $26,750 in the banking service in the city of Newport-on-Lviv
On Friday morning, 2,750 miners were killed at Brink's Incasator, a banker in Newport-on-Lviv, speaking in the press release of the Newport police.
According to researcher Dennis McCarty, the head of the bronchial micropathy took the presence of a bank in the entertainment complex and decided to manage it by new banks.
At the time, “like Brink's staff, he ran away from a thief” and stole a bag with banknotes for banknotes.
According to the witnesses of the incident, several suspects fled from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information on these persons are requested to contact the local police office, number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The repper changed his name to Him
Rapper Kane West has given himself a new name: Yes.
In this regard, he announced on Saturday in Twitter: “A charity previously known as Kanya West”.
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and has even put it in the name of his eighth album, which appeared in June.
News of this occurred before Kanya appeared in the Saturday Night Live transfer, where he planned to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanje West, in place of Ariana, who refused to participate because of “emotional experiences”, reported the author of the transfer.
Wast earlier stated that the pseudonym was not only a minor version of his name but also a religious concept.
“ Yes, the most frequent word in the Bible, ‘ yes ’, ” West explained the name of his album in one of the recent interviews of the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
"It's me, it's you, it's us.
The beginning was Kanya, which means “one, ” and now I — and only Him — is the reflection of the very good, the bad, the innocent of us all at once.
And the album is an attempt to make us think who we are.
The dog is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Shawn Combs, previously known as Paf Deddi, Pi Diddy or just Diddy, this year asked him to call himself Lav (love) or Brazza Lav (Brother Love or Brother Love).
He also changed his name several times with the West Rep. J. Z.: with a defisted and unwritten letter or letter.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico, has never tried to win the war against the civilian population before the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended with a bloodbath.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatelolko Square, President Lopes Obrador promised: “You will never get help from the Mexican people.”
At this point, on 2 October 1968, during the peaceful demonstration of the students, the first shootings were launched and 300 people were killed, which was based on the strengthening of left student movements in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship for education and opening up a large number of free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects for education bring young people into the criminal world.
United States dollars need to double funding for the development of II
China and its efforts in the field of artistic intelligence (II) should not be underestimated. The United States must double investment in its scientific development, according to Li Caifu, investor and entrepreneur for the development of II with the experience of work in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
A number of U.S. ministries have previously made statements about II, although in general the United States does not have a clear strategy for II development.
At the same time, China has presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in IE innovations by 2030.
“The increase in the budget for IIA research would be a good start twice, given that all other countries are very far away from the United States, and we expect the next break in IIA,” says Li.
The increase in funding can double the chances that the next major II will be achieved in the United States, Li CNBC said this week.
Li, whose book "Supertains of Art: China, the Kremnia Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director-General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding IO companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie-Mellon, which took over the best game in the United States of America, and was then the leader of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
It referred to previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Defence Advanced Research Projects, and wondered when the next competition would be to help people find a non-traditional idea.
According to Li, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government benefits.
“China does not attract academic leaders, but corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been drawing from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
I am convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to develop artistic intelligence.
“I think that Green Card candidates should be offered automatically in the field of artistic intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of the next generation's artistic intelligence.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences grants scientific funding in the same way as the National Scientific Fund and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is below, according to Li.
Earlier this year, the United States Ministry of Defence has established a United Nations Centre for Arts, where partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House has announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Cultural Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced that $2 billion was invested in the AI Next programme.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million per year in IA study.
In the meantime, the United States legislation that has tried to establish the National Intelligence Commission has not taken any action in this regard for a few months.
Macedonians vote at the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in the referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, consisting of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has put emphasis on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June both Governments concluded an agreement based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalists claimed that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign of the fighter questioned whether the voter would be at least 50 per cent in the referendum.
The question raised at the referendum was raised as follows: “Are you a member of NATO and the EU, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
The parties to the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for entry into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future country, for Macedonia’s youth, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would observe the results of the vote in order to make it decisive, although it did not have a binding legal force.
The amendment will require a majority of two thirds of Members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received by 13:00.
However, the figure was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, president of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son Dusko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country, which opens the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Before the Assembly was established in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene by setting up a chair for the halls set up by the subjects of citizens who are gathering to celebrate the referendum.
"We are members of NATO and the EU, but we want to join a high-level head rather than defeating official cabinets," Kavardarkov says.
"Yes, we are the citizens of the poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not want to adopt us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would invest in Macedonia, which was so necessary in that country where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be more than that because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be “a reward for our well-being”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies indicated that from 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that was the below requirement.
In another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV, it was found that 57 per cent of respondents were planning to vote in the resurrection.
70 per cent of this figure claims to be positive.
For the referendum to be established, the vote should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major attack on Western Government policies since it came to power in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City is protecting Briton to kill naked
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have dealt with the protection of Briton, bringing Manchester City to victory with account 2:0 on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero was killed at 65 minutes, it was said that he had no work to do.
At the beginning of the episode, an Argentine attacker got a dog in the center of the field.
He's been walking between the three Britons before he hit open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four opponents in the green football field.
He planted a protector and planted several more on the edge of the Bridge.
He next handed the Starling sword to the left.
The English attacker, in the inscription area, returned to the sword of Aguero, whose right to it was broken by the traitor of Briton, Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
"Aguero is experiencing some foot-and-mouth problems," said the coach Manchester City, Pep Gvardiol.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was said to us that he killed the cave at that time."
But Sterling gave the "heavenly Deep" initial advantage in fighting the Prime Minister.
That guy was killed in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero got a sword, being deep in the Briton Territory.
He gave a great deal of money on the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few cases before sending Starling to the next stage.
The attacker "heavens" killed a sword in his mouth just before he found himself outside the field.
Manchester City met Hoffenheim in the Ligi Championships group on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rein-Nekkar-Arene in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick up a check at Colorado Rockies.
After Washington Nachionals was released from the play-off battle, there was no special reason to force the events.
But the innovative Sherzer is hoping to take up the fight against Colorado Rokis in the resurrection, but only if Rokis, who are in a game in Los Angeles Dogers in the Western Division, starts with playoff problems.
Winning 5-2 over Neschenals on Friday night, Rokizi has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to have their title in the first division.
“And although we play just that, at least we can hold positions, knowing the great importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and another team, probably unforeseeable this year.
How can I miss that?"
Neschenals have not yet declared the poet to be resurrected, but, in the latter case, they are willing to present Sherzer in this role.
Sherzer, who's going to play 34th, he's going to be a drinker on the fourth floor, and on the resurrection day, he's going to be a drinker.
Washington, D.C., 18-7 with rating ERA 2,53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
The tram runs a preliminary race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the election of the Republicans, the President referred to the situation in Bretta Kavano, a candidate appointed by the President of the Supreme Court.
“All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remained before one of the most important choices in our lives.
That's very, very important, and I'm not running, although I'm really running, I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere."
The trumpet continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to return their authority, using any necessary means, and we are observing the breadth and movement.
They are all equal to those they try to transgress in order to gain power and control, but we are not going to give them any more.
Democrats, he claims, have set out to “restrain and stop.”
He said, “You will observe it in the last four days.” He said, “The wicked, the ignorant, the foolish, and the liars.”
He referred to the Legal Committee of Senat, referring to Senator Diane Finstein, who called for a loud call from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you allowed the contents of this document to be removed?
Mm... mm... what document?
No, no, I've never seen the body's language before.'
The Liberian Party is no longer an organization that maintains different views.
It does not show tolerance to someone who expresses his opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party offered me a suggestion on the cause of my mistrust, that was not unexpected.
Finally, I am the last of several Members of parliament from the Liberian Party who have not yet said that we are not pleased with what we have said.
The same is true of my colleague, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, in my case, I've been criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe — on the ground of the trial — is the issue that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Leborist Congregation was informed on Friday that “we would like the assemblies to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight-year stay as a local member of parliament from the Liberian party was the GC Friday evenings.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not match those many meetings, but the promise of a "better human and soft" policy has been long forgotten if it was ever so.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Liberian party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader; the colleagues whom I previously viewed as my own political outlook expected me to make a cardinal change in my views and take a position that I would never agree with — whether on national security or on the single EU market.
Every time after my public statement, because it is not important for me to say what I am saying, social networks should be subjected to harassment calling for elections to be rejected by the centre's policy or claiming that I should not be a member of the lobbyist party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
In fact, I know that I have been attracted to more than some of my colleagues, because the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I am proud of the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who daily face sexual or racist attacks, but never give up.
Most of all in this policy, it is disappointing that such a number of abuses have been considered normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said that the Liberian party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church” and with each vote of distrust or change of the party's election rules has already become.
For the past two years, I have received many recommendations that invite me to sit down and talk, and then everything will be fine with me.
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Since I joined the Liberians 32 years ago, as a student of the school that was rewarded by the anti-fraud attitude of the Government of Tetcher, which my school class had literally collapsed, I have tried to stand up to the highest standard of public service for those who need most — whether the local Member State or the Government Minister.
I've never been hiding my political views, I haven't done it in the past.
No one in the East could correctly interpret my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would like to say to those who supported this vote on Friday: our country is moving with this effort to Brexit, which will certainly bring economic, industrial and public unrest, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to call is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are legislators or not: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that no threat to canceling the results of the elections or political advantage does not prevent me from acting as I consider necessary in your interests.

Ery 38 - 17 Melrous: The Unvicted Ere comes first
Two delayed attempts may have had some final results, but Er has undoubtedly earned a triumph in this amazingly interesting matter of the Tenent Premier.
Now they're headed by a table, the only unvictable team of ten.
Finally, all thanks to their superior protection, as well as the ability to choose the time needed, which gave Peter Merchi the master and trainer the right to be fully satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for integrity, and we are still in the wrong, so I have no reason to regret it,” Peter Merci commented.
Robin Cristy, Melrous, said, "It's going to give us the right ear, they've been better for us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, carried out by Fréser Climo, led to the "E" ahead, but the wild card released for the game "Voriors" by the Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrous" to move forward, and Jason Baggott seized an unrealized attempt.
The climate increased the "Er" emissions from the fine, before, directly in the middle of the game, the shock was working, and then, in the break, it carried out a single attempt, making the "Er" account 17-5.
But Melrous started a second half good, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to achieve the Biggoto was reduced to five seconds.
Then a long break was made because of the serious trauma of Rurida Knott, who had been raised, and after the re-examination, Er continued thanks to the efforts of Stafford McDouale to realize the climate.
Acting Captain Blair McFerson then received a yellow card, and Melrous again persuaded the opponents to pay a certain game for an infamous attempt by Bruce Colvin, at the end of the period of intense pressure.
However, the economy was back, and when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card to capture the climate without a stick line, McFerson made a tacdown behind the next "Er" coin.
Climo realized the advantage, not remaining practically from its own return, after Kyle Roo had been hit by David Armstrong and sent to the top attacker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the field.
Still Game Star is about to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kiran star is about to start working in the hotel industry: it has been known that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular show, which he writes, and is filmed together with former comedian partner Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Creigang.
According to official information, he is the Director of the Afförmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan intends to participate in the "increasing restaurant business" in Glazgo.
"We're the sea": without access to the Bolivian sea, hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the La Pase military headquarters.
The public buildings are covered with mud.
The military-morrow bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described by a lozung: "We must be right.
It is our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a living memory of the coastal line lost in Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century because of the resources; life and effort are reflowing over the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the strongest in recent decades, as Bolivia expects the decisions of the International Court of Justice, which will be held on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a mental balance, and, of course, there is a positive outcome," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many patients will observe the decision-making process in the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia's declaration that, after decades of urgent negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to provide Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is struggling to re-election next year, also looks forward to the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not take a decision for Bolivia, and if so, that will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to manage the Chilean territory and has already declared that there will be no impact on possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made only six months after the last arguments were heard says that the case was “not difficult”, says Pas Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
In the last four years, Bolivia's case has not been resolved, and it has always been dismissed.
“The current administration of Bolivia used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes”, says Zarate.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chilean kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
These two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, did not agree that the court's decision was made too quickly.
The Monday will provide Bolivia with “a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity “to put an end to 139 years of mutual benefit”.
Calzadili also disagrees that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, is using the military and maritime problem as a political trap.
“The disease is never denied its right to access the Pacific,” he says.
“The decision of the court is another opportunity to convince us that we have to move through our past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be until it can trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Riy Yoon Ho says that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
At the United Nations Geneva meeting on Saturday, Riy took the floor.
He called on the United States to implement the commitments made at summits in Singapore between the leaders of its countries.
His comments are based on the gradual return of US Commissioner Mike Pompeo to the reinstatement of the Turkish nuclear diplomacy over more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Xin.
Ri argues: The dream that the long sanctions and objections of the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean war at any time put the North on the knees is a lie.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration unless Phanyan has already taken significant steps to disarmament.
And Kim, and president of the United States Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, scepticism regarding the fact that Phinyan is seriously involved in the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security is widely distributed.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Tramp.
Paris fashion shows a new line of massive bulkheads that promise to appear in the mass sale and will carry them directly with you
If you want to add a needle to your collection or completely protect from sunlight, you don't have to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the mass of unusual main units, which were part of their SS19 collection and the blind visitors of the week of fashion in Paris.
In this summer, very unactivative trails attracted the popularity of Instagram signatories, and designers decided to send their nesting creatures to the floor.
The outstanding example of Valentino: the main refugee group, shaped by large fields, appeared on the front, was beautiful on the heads of models.
Other massive accessors included damaged precious stones of the archipelago and even annas, but not all of these headaches were intended to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also appeared at peace with the collection of amazing masks, which had come very close to the attack of Halloween.
On many of these beaches, there was a mouth protection, and they had more memories of the portrait of Hannival Laker than the creation of the kitchen.
One of the specimens recalled a watertight swim with a hole and a protective shield, while the other was a growing sea.
If you are a worshiper of the Most High, He will guide you.
Modal criticism predicts that these huge slips have every chance to break into a mass sale — directly to you.
The huge peaks are five La Bomba, a ballast with a field of width in two feet, which were already expected from Riana to Emily Ratakovski.
The cultural label, which released this extremely unprofessional trap, has brought such widespread popularity into the social networks, has been born and sent out to play on the floor by another huge accessories — a flat bag, almost as large as the one in the buyer’s own model missing.
The orange bag from the decorated raffle with a white leather handle and an anchovies from the raffin became a bright specimen of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on Sunday of fashion in Paris.
Selebritist Luke Armitage tells F.D.: “I think large bags and bags will appear in the mass sale next year, as the designer has already produced such a forum for his products, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is of great importance to citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue to be the tradition of flashing education, which was confirmed again in 2018: the results of the exams have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other public-based disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, and seek to provide a higher level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education chosen by them as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in the language he understands, you call him to mind.
If you speak with him in his own language, you will surely approach him with your heart.’
This is convincing evidence that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
As a result of this year's latest exams, we see that languages take leadership positions in the league tables and have the highest grades of exams in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of foreign-language students received a higher “A”.
The data received by 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (China) while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that in Scotland ' s independent schools foreign languages are undoubtedly important for children and young people in the future.
Language items are currently being used with the same question as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the education programmes of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the causes of the difficulties faced by workers in filling vacancies were inadequate in language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly a guarantee of a successful career for young people.
Given that more predictable jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what a student will choose, if he learns a second language, he will receive a real advantage in the future, with another additional training that will be acceptable to him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages the competitive benefits.
According to YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak enough foreign language to support the discussion, and only 15 percent spoke French with a dual language.
That's why investment in language education is so current.
The knowledge of a number of languages, especially those of developing countries, gives children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland schools, there is a great deal of confusion about languages that are taught — in each school in its own language.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are most important to Britain in the light of the country’s future development by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, in independent schools, he will always choose from a number of languages with a teaching component, which members are experts in those languages.
The Independent Schools of Scotland strive to create an environment for training and training for children and to equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denied that language is still vital in the global business environment for the future development of the country, and that should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “arts of the international community”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which ensures diversity and advantages for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edwards, Director of Scotland Independent Schools Board
Lebron deplores Lakers in San Diego on the resurrection
The dark waiting for fans to see how Lebron James will first appear in Los Angeles Lakes, almost finished.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James is playing in a pre-resurrection match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how long he's gonna have to play.
"More than one and less than eight hours," Walton replied to the official Lakers website.
The Lakers Reporter Mike Truddle wrote in Twitter that James, most recently, played a limited time.
After training early this week, James asked about his plans about six pre-school games in Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to be in pre-school games to prepare for the season,” he replied.
Front-end trampa in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp starts a preliminary meeting tonight at Wiling, West Virginia.
This was the first of five planned Trampa meetings the following week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidate proposed by the Supreme Court was suspended, the Tempp seeks to provide support to the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote is held in November.
How many meetings will there be tonight in West Virginia, and how can you see it online?
The meeting with Trompo in Wiling, West Virginia will be held at 19:00 a.m. to the east today, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trampa meeting with the Western Virginia voters online on YouTube's direct transmission.
The trauma is likely to be heard this week in order to raise its candidate, Brett Kavano, to serve as the Supreme Court, and the proposal by this candidate led to a mass of negative objections, as Kawano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote that was to be taken in Senate would be postponed until the week before the FBI conducted the investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the republics of the November elections to take a preliminary step.
Thus, the campaign of President Trampa aimed at helping those five meetings to be held the following week to “increase the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters wrote.
“The control over the Congress is so important to his report that the President must visit as many states as possible, as we are entering the pressing pre-election aggression season,” said the press secretary of the Trampa pre-election campaign, who was rejected, told Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wilinging could attract participants from "... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract attention to the Pittsburgh media", reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit to the West Virginia Treaty this Saturday is the second visit to that country in the last month, for it has benefited more than 40 per cent in 2016.
The tramp is trying to assist the candidate in the Senate of Patrick Morris, West Virginia, which remains the result of the investigations.
“The fact that Morrisi has to come in for an interview with the competitors, is a bad sign for Morris himself,” says Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia, quoted by Reuters.
Raider's 2018 Cube: The United States of America is ready to fight and asks for hope by sending in the wake of a joint meeting
After three separate sessions, the Saturday game two to two, perhaps, was what Cubak Rydera needed.
The moving initiative is an outstanding game concept, but it is believed to be a game, and it is very clear on such occasions.
So who has the initiative?
"They've had six shots, and now four, so, I think, this is a small initiative for us," Jordan Spy said.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four shots, and twelve more on the horse.
The Americans, in the view of the Sparta, feel “the wind in the clouds”, and they have reason to keep the spirit on high, not least because of the form of Sparta and Justin Thomas played all day together, and each can be praised by three of the four stars.
Spit was kept from you to the grass before he gave a personal example.
The winning voices became all too loud as his circle continued, and the decisive sword was thrown into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas entered two to two.
His attack, which won them on the 15th of July, was met with a similar vote, one of those who spoke of his faith in a chance for the American team.
“You must meet with all your strengths and focus only on your game,” he commented.
That's all that's left of the games now.
Go 18 months and become winners.
The only games that have played for the last two days are Spit and Thomas, French Mollinaires and Tommy Flytwood, who have never been in the history of Kubka Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe had been shot four out of four, and they didn't seem to know the mistake.
"Molivid" was the only couple who didn't pick up the gods on Saturday, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday morning, Friday on Friday, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series and their energy seems to circle between them and indistinct patients, strengthens the belief that and in the resurrection they will not be defeated, and when the sun falls beyond the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more significant game that confirms the potential victory of Europe than Flytwood or Molinari.
It would be great if both were on different moons at the same time.
However, speak of the glory of Europe until it is too late.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly discussed with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the game in four games when he was in a fight with Alex Norren.
The gods and the two gods on the first nine moons cast down the Spanish and the Swedish, from which they were unable to find.
So in the resurrection no one will help you get out of your stomach.
It is so exciting to watch the games in four games and four games because of the interaction between couples, the councils they exchange, and those they intend to reduce, and how the strategy can be changed in one motion.
So far, Europe has played better than a team, and has had a great impact on the past day, but this fourth session has also shown that the United States of America has all the forces to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
At the end of the day, the Council of Europe is headed by account 10-6
Europe will receive the most sensitive privilege on the final day of Cuba Raider after the end of the Saturday mats in four cats and fours with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired poets Tommy Flytwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the fighter Tiger Woods to bring the account to Le Golf National in four seconds.
The European team of Thomas Bourne, who wanted to return to the lost in Hazellina two years ago, dominated the American team's leading error in tomorrow's games, winning with account 3-1.
The United States has had more opposition in the quarter, won two matches, but they have not been able to cut the gap in the accounts.
Commander Jim Ferica needs eight copies of the 12th of resurrected mothers to keep the trophies.
Flytwood is the first European novel to win four prizes, while he and Molinaires, who received the name Molliwood after the seasonings, have become the only second pair who won four prizes in the first four matches in the history of Cuba Ryder.
When Woods and Patrick Reid broke into four swords, they then gathered hugely together to win over the Falling Spirit of Woods and American Newborn Briton with even more decisive 5/4.
The Woods, last two Saturdays, showed periodical problems, but now he lost 19 out of 29 mats in four cats, and the four were seven.
Justin Rose, who took the lead in the morning game in four games, returned to Henry Stanson's team on Thursday, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with account 2/1, taking the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game has not become easy and pleasant for the day to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time champions George Spitt and Justin Thomas worked as two shots for the Americans on Saturday.
They worked hard with the 2/1 account over the Spanish John Ramom and Ayan Polter in the game in four games and returned later to play Polter and Rory Makillro's 4/3 account, lost the first two moons.
Only two times in the history of Kubka Ryder, the team had to be pulled out of four shots, leaving alone, bearing in mind that the Ferika team, as I do, had to be played out to hold the trophies.
However, after two days of second arrest, the contract in the resurrection seems to be beyond their ability.
North Korea says that “categories” will not be deployed in a unilateral manner without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea declared to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions strengthened the confidence of the United States, and that his country would not give up its nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner under any circumstances.
Ri Yon Ho said to the General Assembly every year that North Korea had taken “a major measure of good will” last year, such as the end of nuclear and rocket tests, the decommissioning of nuclear ignition and the obligation not to increase nuclear weapons stocks and not to develop nuclear technologies.
"But we don't see a symmetric reaction from the United States," he said.
“With no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot take the first action on disarmament”.
While Ri reiterated the voice of North Korean complaints against Washington ' s “passing” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step action, its statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as had been done in the past by Phenyan.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Chen Yun and Donald Tramp on the first in history between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader who took place in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start the movement on the part of the Korean peninsula, and Trap promised North Korea security.
North Korea is attempting to formalize the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States states that Phinyan must have begun to withdraw from its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the call for the reduction of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that "denuclearization must first be produced", and that the pressure through sanctions is increased in order to achieve its objective urgently and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", says Ri.
“The notion that sanctions can put us on the knees is a doubling dream of people who don’t know us.
But this problem is that continuing sanctions strengthen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second high-level meeting between Kim and Tramp, which the United States leader mentioned at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun J. Inom, who took place in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been a party to this issue, rather than the United States, the Korean peninsula would not have been such a fool.”
However, Ri's words were quite different from last year when he told the UN Assembly that the target of North Korea's rocket on the United States mother was inevitable after the “Mr. President of Evil” Trap called Kim “smomist”.
This year, UN Tromp, who had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for her courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there was still much to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is not released.
In the middle of the trip, he said that he did not indicate any time period for this process: “It would take two years, three or five months. ”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Phanyan for the steps taken.
However, United States Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and legally until we see a complete, final and confirmed decollarization”.
The Security Council has consistently strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to closing the financing of the Phenyan nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN Geneva summit and reported that he would visit Phenyan again in the next month to prepare for the second high-level meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has failed.
In July he left Phinyan, saying that progress had been made, but for a few hours after that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandite requirements”.
North Korea has promised to demonstrate a rocket complex and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Mona this month, if the United States will take “relevant measures”.
In his statement Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he had mentioned were security assurances that the Tempp had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to breathe at special courses
A new course introduced this year at Harvard University helped all students to learn more to sleep and to fight the shovinist culture of the continuous use of caffeine in order to celebrate “nightly”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, a sleep health professor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he considered to be the first in his class in the United States.
After his opening, he was angered by the idea of introducing such a course, which had been preceded by a report on the impact of sleep failure on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, ‘I’m sorry that I knew about this only now that I’m almost finished.’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which I was surprised," he told The Telegraph.
The course, first proposed for students this year, describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports success, as well as how it improves the overall sense of human being.
Paul Barreyra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, says that the university has decided to introduce this course after it has been made clear that students are experiencing a serious lack of sleep during the school week.
Over a period of time, the students are carrying out a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections of employment, it is suggested that a room in the community where students wear coffee hats, teas, coaches and books get information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, and lack of sleep — affect sports results and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In the second section, participants are aware of how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The interactive map of the campaign encourages the participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these jobs do not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the false feeling of pride that a person can “sleep all night ” is still quite widespread, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
According to him, the amount of sleep of good quality is a “secret weapon” of a student to fight stress, nervousness, and anxiety, and even to fight with an empty weight, as a lack of sleep translates the brain into a diet, allowing him to constantly experience hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old caliph, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course, visited one of the jobs last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to spread this information across the camp.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all the inspectors to conduct a similar training program before going to a competitive training institute.
Professor Chesler recommends that students set up a guide that warns them to sleep and relax, as well as to remember the harmful effects of the “old world” on electronic screens and light-delight lamps, which corrupts the human bureaucratic and leads to problems with pollution.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga wins over Gerard's command
The Rangers survived a series of press release meetings, as Dolly Menga had brought an unconvened team of Steven Gerard to the ground with an account of 1:0 in Livingstone.
The command of Ibross was expected to win his first victory after the victory with account 4:1 in February in St. Johnston, but the command of Gary Holta brought only the second defeat of Gerard of 18 games as manager, leaving his command on eight o'clock behind, giving the easy victory to the Order of Harts, the leader of the Scottish Prime Minister.
Menga was killed in seven minutes before the break, and the Reingers, who had lost the spirit, seemed to be unable to balance the account.
At the time that Rangers had now settled in the sixth place, Livingstone was raised in the third place, and Hybernian only had access to dead heads.
The Rangers may also have additional problems after a linear judge, Kalum Spence, came to treat the head wound after an item was removed from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in a team that passed through Er in a semifinal for the Scottish religion of Cuba.
In turn, Holt went with the same strategy as Livi 11, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be happy to see his well-informed composition push the opponents on every step.
The Rangers may have led the sword into power, but Livingstone survived more when the sword came to it.
They had to lose their head in just two minutes, when the first translator of Manga Scott Pittman stopped Ann McGregor, but the lawyer used the chance shown.
Kigan Jackobs has been attacked by the captain of the crew of Craig Halkettu, but his defense partner, Alan Litgo, has only managed to send a sword to the side of the next stage.
The Rangers took control, but in the last three, it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he was supposed to have been hit in forty-five minutes when he and Stephen Lawles met, but Judge Steven Thompson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers did two first-time strikes, but former owner of Aebros, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about the attack by Lassan Kulibali on his head, and the weak strike by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's first goal, which was killed at 34 minutes, may not have been in harmony with the game, no one can deny that they earned it exclusively by their own efforts.
However, the Rangers failed to deal with the game of Jacobs with the standard.
Scott Archfield didn't react when Declan Galler gave Scott Robinson the sword, trying to get all the power to hand the sword over to Menga to finish it.
Gerard began to act on the break when Kulibali spoke to Ryan Kenta, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted when the final plaintiff left Morelos's passport, but the impressive Kelly started out with her cover line.
But Livingstone continued to attract guests in their dream game with the participation of Litgo and Halket, constantly making long transfers.
The Holta team tried to increase the gap at the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgo was transferred from the field.
The Rangers game, Glenn Midlton, had a sudden hit after he had met Jacobs, but Thompson had refused.
Almanah: Recruiter of the Hague Accountant
And now the page of our Almanac “Montenegro”: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, in Germany, the future physics of Johannes Wilhelm Gans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — a device known as the Geiger account.
As one of the basis of science, Geiger's account also became one of the basis of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film "Colocola Coronado", with the Combo-like Roma Rogers and Dale Evans — such as those that are not similar to scientists — in the main role:
The human said, “What is the matter with these birds?”
Rogers: "It's the Geiger account, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you hope for these particles, you can actually hear the effects of atoms born with radioactivity in minerals."
Evans will say, "You have listened now."
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not a few days before he was 63 years old.
But his creation, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to see the anomaly cells
A new anticancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see” the anomaly growing cells and kill them.
Part of the treatment of vaccines is to learn the immune system to identify anatomical cells
Method of removing the immune cells from the patient and changing them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells get the ability to see a protein type that is characteristic of many cancers, then cells must be 0 again
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who has been infected with this vaccine and the immune system that has learned to recognize the anomaly cells has been infected with ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which modified cells can see HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then re-enter the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, National Institute for Cancer Research, Wifezda, Maryland, states: “The results we have received suggest that we have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers”, including the cancer of the liver, the liver, the liver, the liver, and the blood.
A similar method has been successfully applied to the treatment of leukemia, and it has been included in the collection of immunological cells in patients and their “learning” as it should affect cancer cells.
Kane West spoke in defense of the trampa in the MAGA trap after his arrival in SNL.
It's all gone bad.
Kanje West was awarded a scholarship during the Saturday concert he held in the defence of President Donald Trampa, claiming that he would resume the post in 2020.
After completing his third song, called "Gold-Prizrak", he followed the title "America's Great Reconnaissance", the performer spoke against the democracies and supported the Trip.
I often talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support the Tranquill, who is a racist?"
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have been out of America a long time."
The SNL channel held a parallel show with Matt Damon in the main role of the Hollywood star, where the presentation of Brett Cavano before the Senate's Court Committee on Christina Blaise Ford's statement on sexual harassment.
On television, they did not show how the crowd reacted to Westa’s statement, but the video was loaded into social networks by Chris Rock’s comics.
Now it's not clear whether Rock tried this step to take Westa.
West also appealed to the public to have his hat taken from the culinary.
“They put their hands on me behind my back.
They say, don't get out of this trap.
They were really up against me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying: “And they still said that my position is not bad.”
He will say, "Would you like to know that there is no god but He?
Then you will need love."
At least two of his comments drew the attention of the audience, SNL members were said to be lost, and one person said: “All the studies were being carried out in silence.”
Wasta recently invited to replace Ariane Grande, who was a former boyfriend, Reper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
Many have chosen to perform the West song "I Love it" in Perrier's boots.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Kendis Terner Conservative Group, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the most courageous people: SPASIBO FOR THE STAY OF MONEY”.
The leading actor Karen Hunter wrote in Twitter that West was just “the one who is, and that is absolutely remarkable”.
“However, I do not want to support anyone (purchasing his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creation) who, in my view, divides and spreads a ideology that is valuable to my community.
He is a free man.
Like us!" she said.
Before the show started, Reper announced in Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he was now “formally known as Kanya West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's on Diddy's feet, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Pi Diddy.
In his colleague, Rep. Snup Doga had a name for Snup Lyon, and as another example, it is possible to bring in an executioner, a newly formed legend, the Prince who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist, previously known as Prince.
Attempting to prosecute for the murder of a tax collector in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife injuries on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred in Ballihakamore, as reported in the police.
The respondent is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the State Prosecutor.
Kit Harington's game star is attacked by toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a migrating sword of John Snow in the violent mid-medium fantasy series HBO "The Game of Prestols".
However, recently, a 31-year-old actor went so far as to criticise a heroist stereotype, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that to be respected, they must be cruel.
In his interview The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he felt that “something was wrong” and asked how to solve the issue of toxic masculinity in the era #MeToo.
Kitt, who recently married his colleague on the film Game of Presbyterians, admitted that he was “not quite equal” to the problem.
“I personally take this question seriously, where have we been affected by the masculinity?" asked the actor.
“Why do we teach adult children that we have a problem today?”
China believes that television can be partly blamed for the complexity of toxicity caused by too many muscle personnel.
And he will say, “What is it that is cursed, and what has been given to him?”
What do they teach on television and on the streets, making young men feel that they should show only one particular aspect of maturity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question of how we can change it?
Because today with young people, it's really not.
In the interview, he also recognized that he would not participate in any “The Game of the Thrones” anymore after the series ended next summer, saying that he was “completed with battalions and evils”.
As of November, Kitt played a major role in the filming of the real West Sam Shepard, the film producer and his brother, the rapist.
The actor recently announced that he believed that meeting with a woman named Rose was the best final for him.
“I met my wife on this series, so he gave me my family and my life, ” said the actor.
Rose played Igrist — an object of passion by the Chinese staff John Snow in the fictional series entitled Amy’s prize.
Para noted the marriage in June 2018 at Lesley's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
Only about 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
In most cases new cases of disease were sexually transmitted, which indicates changes in the trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of the flow of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV injuries, namely, had been practically zeroed, by Chinese health representatives at a conference in the province of June.
Every year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexualism was determinized in China in 1997, but the discrimination against LGBT was still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex relations with men end up marrying women due to the conservative values of the country.
In many cases the transmission of diseases is due to the lack of protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to drugs against HIV as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Watters is investigating information about the prosecution of the senators of the Republican Party, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “precious theories”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, denied on Saturday that one of her staff provided personal information to three United States senators on the websites of the lawmakers in Wikipedia.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that claims were made by “ultra-legal” experts and websites.
“Lie, lie, and even more lie,” says Wutters in his Twitter.
The information is reported to include the address and telephone number of the United States senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Yuta.
This information was made available on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hall during the hearings of the Senate Commission on Sexual Charges against a candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano.
The escape occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of communications had been linked to the Waters office, and that information was made available to the Waters staff, reports Hill.
“This unreasonably false claim is absolutely false,” Utters assures.
“The members of my staff, whose personality, information and security have been compromised as a result of these muscle actions, were not in any way responsible for the withdrawal of this information.
This unreasonably false claim is a lie.”
Uters' statement immediately triggered criticism on the Internet, including by former press secretary of the White House, Ari Flejcher.
"This is a hate," says Fleycher.
“This means that the author has a temperature that is not suitable for the work of the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why don't you get hurt?
And you don't have to justify it either.
And you shouldn't be hiding in the motives of the prosecutors either.
You must remain calm and cool.”
Flyshire, it was said, compared with Utters' reaction to the democratic criticism of the Kawano judge, whose criticism was accused of being too bad during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans who fought at Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If this is the truth, it is very important," he says.
In his statement, Walters writes that her office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these moustaches.
“We are concerned that the criminals will be found,” she writes, “and that they will be responsible for all their actions that can be devastating and dangerous for all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny Inglich is replaying a blow — a weak parade of spy Rowen Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film that describes Britain in some way, which is also related to the new traditional Spanish novel "Agenta Johnny Ingles", which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film "Agent Johnny Ingles: Recharge".
Does a self-sustaining picture with a “probably we’re all dead” is a new attempt on national exports?
In any case, Professor Johnny Inglesch's fingerprints have acquired his right to chaos a second time — that is, his name clearly means that he is a broad-screen comic book designed for a non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, was a secret agent who, despite his impressive claims on glazing, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bina's painting and his poem, which brought a single note to the young Chariots of Fire in London at the Olympics ceremony in 2012.
Initially, this person was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the forgotten “International” Atkinson, who once played in the memory of Barclaycard’s television advertising, in which the hero left behind the chaos.
There is one or two pleasant moments at this latest.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglesch came near the helicopter, walked in the middle of the afternoon, and the thieves lay on his back.
Yes, it shows that Atkinson's contribution to the physical performance of the comedian scenes, but the heat itself seems to be quite weak and strange, especially since such "serious" cinemas as Agent 007 and the "Mission failure" are now confidently offering a comedian as an element.
Such a feeling that anger is calculated on children rather than on adults, and I think the amazing crimes of Johnny England are not as dramatic and appropriate as those of Atkinson in the films about Mr. Bine.
The Permanent Mission is now committed to the fact that Britain is in serious crisis.
Kiber hacker entered the top-secret Spanish British network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the district agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, had an epidemiological role.
This is the last trap for the Prime Minister, who has tried and posted a picture that is already suffering from huge political instability: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the Quazi Terez-May personnel, but in the scenario there is nothing to do with it.
Its intelligence consultants inform her that, as each active spy has been compromised, she has to remove someone from the scene.
And here is a scene where Johnny Inglesch is an independent person, who is now working as a school teacher in some places, but also gives informal lessons about the secret operation: there are several good jumps here, as England offers Spanish Academy skills in the style of "ro".
England is returning to Withol for extra instruction and reunited with its former ineffective friend Buff, who is playing Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is under the command of the underwater boat, the role of the "beast hockeys" in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Betman and Robin are back in the game because of the terrible mistakes they have made in her secret service, and they are faced with a beautiful year's wife, Ophelia Bulletto, in the performance of Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of falling under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that British computer problems can be solved by the evil Jason Walt, who plays by Jake Lacey.
England and Buff start their haircuts: masked under officers, they are under the French restaurant; they create chaos, a barrier to the wort-skin carriage; England is born with a fragile anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality guarantee to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All these scenes, of course, are kind and touching, but in all of this there is something very childish.
It's full of stuff.
And, as with other films, I couldn't imagine, did the British cinema industry ever have a role to play in Rouen Atkinson, a truly balanced talent?
The Liberians deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the work week of the British until four days after the fifth day of payment
Jeremy Corbin's Leiborist Party is going to consider a radical plan for which the British will work four days a week, but the payments will be made in five days.
The party, as reported, would like the directors of the companies to hand over the savings received as a result of the revolution in the field of artistic intelligence to provide them with additional output.
This would allow staff to enjoy the same three-day income for the same wage.
The sources reported that the idea was “written” in the economic agenda of the party and would help the people of the country become a part of the workforce.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved a four-day working week shift so that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
The High Representative of the Liberian Party said: The Sunday Times is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not occur at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which corresponds to the approach of the Party to change the economic balance for the benefit of the work force, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Liberian Party is not the first to support this idea, since the Green Party has promised four-day working weeks still during its 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this effort is not currently approved by the majority of the Liberian Party.
The representative of the Liberian Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not a party”.
The Tenet Chancellor John McDonnell used a lecture by the lobbyists last week to confirm his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to seize power in the "individual directors" and "expectants" of municipal companies.
The plans of the TEA also mean that current VOCs can not get back all their share, as the Liberian Government can “sacrifices” on the basis of alleged crimes.
It also reaffirmed the plans for the inclusion of business directors in the Board of Directors and the establishment of the Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector's capital to employees who could receive annual dividends up to 500 pounds of Starling.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say 60 minutes, can the FBI's investigation about Cavano change their opinion?
The FBR ' s investigation of charges to Judge Bretta Cavano held a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Judge as a minimum per week and asked whether the Agency's findings could encourage any of the senators to support Cavano.
In the interview presented in the resurrection, “60 minutes” by Scott Pelley, the senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Grem, could the FBI find anything that would stop them from changing their views.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"No, of course," answered Kennedy.
“When I came to the meeting, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
His answer was firm, firm and consistent.”
But Graham's opinion remained unclear when he voted.
"I have firmly determined that Brett Kavano, and my opinion can only be changed with arguments, because of actions comparable to the dynamics," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know is that Brett strongly rejected all of this," said Graham, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of her witnesses could confirm those facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I have not seen in it any new thing.’
What is this Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival (Festival Citizens of Peace) will be the annual musical event that will take part in the impressive star-making and yet impressive mission -- the end of poverty all over the world.
Seven years have passed since the Festival of World Citizens, as many as tens of thousands of people have reached the capital of the Central Park, but not only to satisfy the statements of such executives as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to talk about this objective: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of World Citizens, which was opened in 2012, was the continuation of a global poverty reduction project, which was conducted by the international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively combating it.
In order to obtain a free ticket (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you must have participated in voluntary activities or sent an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other important action aimed at helping to raise awareness of your purpose to end poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of Peace been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is it the idea that people will be rewarded with a free visit to the concert now to convince the arrested to call for action, or is this just another case of so-called "clicitism", when people believe that they make real changes by signing an online petition or sending a message to Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered at the festival by its participants, who pursue many different objectives.
It is recalled that, through these actions, world leaders promised to allocate more than $37 billion, which should affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group heard 390 commitments and declarations made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which has already been paid or collected.
According to the assessment of the group, the funds allocated were directly assisted by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important obligations is the name of The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementing experts committed to “helping children fully open their capacity”, promised Rwanda to provide $35 million to help put an end to the unrest in the area, which was done after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, as you are, we can commit social injustice with regard to the lack of food in the past,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman at a live concert in London, held in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve food for mothers and children in Britain, the Government had announced funding for the Food Chain project, which included 5 million women and children through activities to improve food.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, the festival said: "Why do you think we can end with extreme poverty?"
The organizers of the Global Citizen respond: “This will be a long and difficult way for us to meet and fall down from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights fight and anti-partite movements, we succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wikkend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janel Money, are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, and his leaders will become Debora Lee Fernes and Heu Jackman.
The United States may use a military-naval fleet for the purpose of blockades to prevent the export of Russian energy: Minister of Internal Affairs
US Minister for Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could, when necessary, resort to its military and maritime fleet to prevent the fall of Russian energy carriers on the market, including in the Middle East.
Zinka claims that Russia's presence in Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a proposal to study new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the maritime routes and, where necessary, the blockade that their energy does not enter the market”, said the Minister.
Zinke referred to the activities organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group, which positions itself as the “word of the energy user” in the United States.
It further compares Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient in fuel use and replacement,” said the Minister, calling Russia 'monies with one triangle', whose economy depends on the fossil fuel.
Statements were made because the Trampa Administration had made it a task to increase its exports of frozen natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much more flexible option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the administration of the Trampa, including the United States President Donald Trampa, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "indistinct" project of North Stream-2, which, according to Trampa, made Berlin "Plennik" Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project worth $11 billion, which should double the existing transit capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of poor competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a force for pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States affected the negative reaction of Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industry in the face of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State engages in our energy supply, this creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully explore the potential for presidential elections in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would carefully examine the possibility of balloting in the post of President after the mid-term elections.
At the City Council meeting in Hollyk, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the pre-election run.
“There has been a time for women to go to Washington and "beginning" our corrupt government, and for that reason a woman needs a "up"," says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of balloting in the Presidents.”
Warren thus assessed the activities of President Donald Trampa at the meeting: “This area is going to be in the wrong direction”.
"I'm worried about Donald Trump's doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Tramp itself and his candidate at the post of Supreme Judge Brett Kavano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to conduct a FBI investigation before we start voting.”
However, a survey published in Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should be fought in 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe, 85 per cent of the "problem" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be ballisticked.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other well-known names of democracies discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Berni Sanders.
Baiden claims that he will take an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sara Peelin spoke of the post-traumatic stress disorder of Traka Pellin at a meeting with Donalda Trampa voters
Trek Pailin, 26 years old, served in the army in September, spent the year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experience as members of other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and who have injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Tramp in Talse, Oklahoma.
Pailin called his arrest a blind eye and said of his son and other veterans: “They are already returned to others who are cursed by the question, and are given the same respect to their friends, soldiers, healers and any other war they have committed in their country.”
Trak Peelin was arrested on Monday in Basil, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women in the situation of violence and the possession of weapons in the state of alcohol abuse, according to Dan Bennet, the representative of the police department of Basil.
18 States, in the region of Colombia, support the challenges of the new asylum policy
Eightty states and the region of Colombia support the legal dispute of a new policy of the United States that prohibits the provision of asylum to refugees or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, the representatives of 18 states and districts in Washington, on Friday, gave an analytical note by the Court's consultant on support for the asylum seeker in dispute policy.
The full name of the "Grace v. Sessions", submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not declared.
The woman claims that her civil husband “and his sons in the criminal group” have been subjected to ill-treatment, but on 20 July United States officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers of the States that support Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala make a large number of requests for asylum in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of the United States with regard to the granting of asylum rejected the decision of the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents of domestic violence to submit a declaration of asylum.
In his statement on Friday, the Attorney General of the region of Colombia, Carl Rainin, stated that the new policy “ignores the decades of application of public, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires all requests for asylum to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the search, and this prohibition violates the principle”, said a judicial consultant.
Lawyers also claim that policies prohibiting immigrants from entering into the United States are harmful to the economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour force”.
In June, Dr. Jeff Seschens ordered immigration judges no longer to provide asylum to victims of domestic or Bandit violence.
“The asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” said Sheshns in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious people face every day around the world.
Expected efforts to save people in Paul: the number of missing is doubled in the search for survivors
The situation has become more and more difficult for survivors.
“It is now very difficult,” said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, calming her sick baby at the center of the city of Palu.
“I would like to give a minute of quick assistance to the wounded.
Clean water in a large deficit."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed houses, dig in the dark and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and patients affected by the earthquake of Magnitude 7.5 were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including the Two Harris, who had been the victim of the night shift and the robbery, had to rest at Paul's military hospital, where patients had been treated in open air because they had to leave the room because of continuing strong waves.
He laments how severe earthquakes have destroyed the number in the room in the fifth floor he and his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was impressed by the walls, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screamed, asked for help, and then came quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they will be saved, and I hope they will be all right."
The Ambassador of the United States accuses China of “injurious” attacks carried out by the propaganda campaign.
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a daily release on the four pages of the United States and China on the mutual profit of trade, the US Ambassador of China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Tramp, in the past, sent a payment supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper of the state of Iowa, with accusations in China to try to involve in the elections at the United States Congress on 6 November, which was rejected by China.
The Trampa claim that Beijing is trying to involve itself in the United States election is a confirmation of the fact that US officials reported to Reuters: a new phase is taking place in the growing Washington pressure campaign in China.
While it is normal for foreign Governments to place advertising for the promotion of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the state of trade skating, resulting in the comparison of import tariffs for their countries.
China's responses to the start of the war had the task of harassing exporters in countries such as Ayova, which supported the Republican Party of Trip, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, a United States Ambassador to China and former former governor of Ayov, the major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing is causing harm to American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the resurrection magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this tragedy by placing the propaganda in our own free press”.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Government of China is benefiting our heart from the American tradition of freedom of speech and of free press, advertising and placing a message in the Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
"But in the newspapers here, on the streets of Beijing, you'll never hear unusual voices and you won't see the true variety of views that China might have been aware of, because local media are under strict control of China's Communist Party," he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers “was opened” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not bring the exact name of the issue.
Analyticals warn: by contrast, the Republican Republicans remove female voters from the interim period
Many high-ranking republics prefer to remain on the side and protect the candidate of Supreme Judge Brett Kavano, despite several statements of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, particularly from women who may be affected by the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the situation had spread to the limit, and most of the Republicans had officially declared that they wanted to continue to vote.
Such things cannot be repeated later, says Grant Reyer, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Reyer is convinced that the efforts of Senator Jeff Fleek (R-Arizona) to conduct a FBR investigation, which has been made in the last minute, will be sufficient to satisfy the disappointed voters.
“Women don’t want to forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget about it either tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pier, the senior adviser and the national representative of the MovingOn Group of Progress, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scand the November front! against Senat, when the Republicans of the Judicial Committee had decided to apply to Cavano, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, told Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be behind the framework”, said journalist Stu Rottenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already been strong enough, and that is the truth.
But things can get worse, especially in the case of female voters in the camps and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.”
Even before the Forum had publicly testified against the candidate at the post of the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual harassment, the analysts had assumed that if the Republicans had confirmed the move, this could have been a response.
“This is already an order for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republic in the beginning of the week, as reported by NBC News.
“It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote or whether Kawano is on the ground of suspects, but also about how the Republicans deal with the way they deal with it,” says Guy Cessil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose democracy, the new channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have divided themselves into a number of issues that are to be believed to be for either Ford or Cavano, and they are somewhat closer to the latter.
The new survey, YouGov, shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in the Forum exactly or not, while 35 per cent said they believe in Kavano exactly or not.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano is more likely to be injured or some time ago, while only 30 per cent said the same about the Forum.
Flyk FBR is currently investigating the charges made by the Forum and, at least, another prosecutor, Deboro Ramires, reports The Guardian.
Last week, the Ford under the Covenant witnessed in the Senate's Legal Committee that Cavano, in a state of shock, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramires argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown her his generality at dinner during his studies at the Jelska University in the 1980s.
World Patriotic Buyer Plans to Launch a New Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Ley, the founder of the World Heritage site, is launching a campaign to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people to access.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Lei found that Inrupt's goal was to obtain “peace”.
"We must do this now," he says about his start.
"It's a historic moment."
The annex uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "identity online data storage" or POD.
It may contain a list of contacts, cases, as well as a calendar, music library and other personal and professional data-processing tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — everything can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data online is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a personal extension of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to the Director-General of the company John Bruce, Inrupt concludes that the company has provided resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid available to all.
At present, the company consists of Berners-Lie, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of state-owned developers with whom a contract was concluded on the project, and a community of programmers and volunteers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Ly said that he and his team would not negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether his companies should make cardinal changes, resulting in the total change in all their business models.
“We do not ask their permission.”
In his post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lie wrote that “Mission Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new solid network”.
In 1994, Berners-Lie translated the Internet, establishing a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the voice of Berners-Lie has been quite powerful in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even at the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lie is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next Internet era,” says Berners Lee.
Bernard Vann: Church servant rewarded by Victoria during World War I
In the history of the Church of England, only one war priest was rewarded by Victoria during World War I, and this event was noted in his hometown 100 years later.
Under Colonel Bernard Van was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for participation in the attack on Bellengles and Leukure.
Unfortunately, he was killed four days later by the shooter, so he never realized that he had received a higher British military prize.
A memorial in respect of this event was a tragicly open-ended presentation by his two grandsons at the council in Ruschden, Nortgemptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was a “symbolic sign” that the memorial was opened 100 years after his grandfather received a prize.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Van had his battalion through the canal of St. Canten, “in a very tight streaming and under a strong fire of field weapons and bombs”.
He later jumped onto the fire line and led the group forward, and then one hand broke the field gun, killing three troops of the unit.
Colonel Van was killed by a German gunman on October 4, 1918 — almost a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of hero Michael Van said that “he could hardly do the same heroic thing, but that would calm him down.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set up a vein at the end of the council led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “for him, it was a great honor to participate in the Council” and added that “the well-being of the real hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
The MMA volunteers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they showed Peppa's brother.
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 games, including six main programmes, because they spent all night in a direct effrey on 5 British television channels.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Hagard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British patients were shocked to see the screens of the “Sinku Peppa”.
Some patients did not realize this because they did not sleep until the morning just to see the light.
One of the worshippers in Twitter called this change of news on a child’s multifilm “a sick joke”.
“The public ruling that the content was inappropriate for 6 hours this morning, so they had to switch to child programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, senior vice-president of Bellator on marketing and communications when asked why it had happened.
"Yes, "Skinka Poppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said they were planning to draw up a schedule so that in the future they could also see viewers from Britain.
“As for the re-examination, I think we can solve this issue,” says Kocker.
“But the resurrection there is six hours tomorrow, and we cannot resolve this matter until the resurrection of our time, and for them it will be Monday.
But we're doing the best we can.
Believe that when the news was changed, the boxes of text messages were filled, and all of them were far from friendly.
We were trying to solve this problem right away, thinking it was some technical fault.
It turned out that it was a matter of public importance.
I promise that this will not happen exactly the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of wars to five instead of six, as we usually do, and we're trying to increase this number for fans, but we've got over.
Yes, it has.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily tried to feel inadequate because of his sexual orientation
Olympic driver Tom Daily says he's grown, feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he did not understand that “not all like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first radio program 4 Desert Island Discs, by Lauren Lavern, he said that he had spoken about the rights of gays to give others hope.
He also said that the victory on the Olympics became less anxious after the birth of a child.
A regular multi-year-old show of Kirsty Young took a few months to leave because of the disease.
Daily, speaking on behalf of the main guest in Laverna's programme, said that he felt “more innocent than any of the students” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says, "These feelings of worthlessness and incompatibility have been completely real to this day, but they have given me strength, and I have been able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “something that meant ” not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The double-blind Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and, at his statement on the Games of the Society in Australia, this year called on countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he felt that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time World Championship said that the feelings of a man, the American director of Dustin Lansa Black, with whom he met in 2013, were “resisted.”
In the past year, Dale has been married to the ulareta Oscar, who is 20 years older than he is, but he claims that the difference in age has never been a problem.
“If everything is so young in your life,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died three years later, “it is difficult to find a relative who would have the same cardi-like experience.
Para became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daily said that “all his world life was changed”.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," said a sportsman.
"But you know, there are more and more gold olympic medals.
"My Lord is the Golden Golden Medal."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily told him that his father did not want to rest from his death, and one of his last requests was the ticket in the first round of London 2012.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Dad, you're not going to be a couple anymore, and you can't sit there in the first row," she says.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped to learn, and only when he actually stopped to learn, I finally realized that he was not invincible," said a sportsman.
The following year, Daily participated in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had hoped for all my life, to throw in front of a bunch of Olympic players, it wasn't a better feeling," he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which has helped him to prepare for the Olympics, and he still enjoys it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, resurrection 11:15 in English summer time.
Michaelson, who's not in the shape, has done this Saturday, Kubka Rydera on the stairs.
American Phil Mikelson will set up a record in the resurrection, playing his 47-year-old Kubka Ryder, but he needs to strengthen his form in order to avoid an unpleasant background.
Michaelson, who played in the 12th record, was sent by Captain Jim Furrick to the castle on Saturday for four swords and four.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often in the United States, the five-time winner divided his day between watching and working on his own game in the field in hopes of correcting his concerns.
Never had the most direct hit, even at the peak of his 48-year-old sportman is not an ideal candidate for the heavy break of Le Golf National, where the long race usually inflicts on the wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Michaelson will meet with the exact British Open French Mollinaire champion, who joined the newsman Tommy Flytwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four shots in 12 single matches make a bright start, Michaelson's match can be a decisive one.
Felix expressed confidence in his partner, even though he could still say.
“He fully understood the role he had on him today, grabbed me back, covered me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” he commented.
"He is confident enough.
He's going to the Hall of Glory, and he's done so much for these orders and last week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's what it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On the resurrection day, Michaelson won the Nica Foldo record for the number of mothers in Cuba Rydera.
This may mean the end of the career in Cuba, which was never consistent with the heights of its individual record.
Michaelson had 18 victories, 20 injuries, and seven nothings, although Felix said his presence had brought little benefit to the team.
“He is a funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to impress people, and he's a great guy with whom he's interested,” he explained.
“I think that this week the young players have joined him, and that was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows that a great privilege can soon be lost
Thomas Bourne, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant leadership in a single-level area in Cuba in the Rydera can easily turn into an undesirable side.
In 1997 the Datchan deputised in Valderrame, where the command led by the North Balleteros had a advantage over the Americans in five seconds, but just passed the final score before the smallest difference, won with the account 1411⁄2-131/2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only until then”, said Bourne, impressed on the photo, after the review of the 2018 class, who won the Le Golf National field with account 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday that resulted in 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
You'll be out in full tomorrow.
Go and do the right thing.
Until there are no shots on the table, nothing is done.
We have a goal, and that's a chance to win the trophies, and that's what we need to focus on.
I didn't mean to focus on the 12 games of our team, but we know so well what we are against – the biggest games of peace.”
He added: “I would never have taken myself too seriously.
We're waiting for another test tomorrow.
In the morning, individual statements are being made, and this is already another matter.
It's always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're trying your best at the professional golf course.
That is what must be done in order to be fully exposed tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also make all his efforts."
Unlike Bourne, his opponent, Jim Felix, believes that his individual game will be better than his partners, except for Jordan Sparta and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four shots.
Felix himself went through all this puzzle in recent days, became part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before he finally disappeared when Europe was doing a miracle in the Middle East.
“I remember every detail of this,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krensou, the captain in 1999, had stolen his toys before the last day.
“We have 12 important mothers tomorrow, but you would like to finish all of this earlier as in Brooklyn as in Medin.
When the initiative is moved on one side, this is a major pressure on the media.
We have set up our plan for the game, and have made the children as we thought to be the right one, and we are trying to create a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas had the task of attempting to lead the opposition by meeting Rory McKilroum at the top of the platform with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ramom, Tommy Flytwood and Ayyan Polter, as well as other European games from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen such a group of guys, and in this way, because I think that they are thereby overcoming all possible shortcomings,” Bourne said, commenting on her choice of individual games.
Entry into operation of the new German military vessel has been resumed
The new flag of the German fleet should be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this will not occur at least in the following year because of the wrong system and the cost-effective increase, local SMEs report.
The introduction of the Reinland-Pfaltz, the main ship, perfectly new flagheads of the Baden-Wurtemberg class, now located before the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit with a reference to the military representative.
The court had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen after the shipment had challenged the judgement of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wurtemberg-class ships commissioned by the Marine fleet in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as it is known, they will have a powerful rifle, a multitude of nuclear and anti-shipment rockets, as well as some satellite technologies, such as reduced radiological, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer periods of service, which should be possible for the deployment of new brakes for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the continuous withdrawal of entry into operation means that the most modern military ships, which, as they say, allow Germany to expand its power abroad, are already ageing until they enter into arms, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 FD fell into the headline of news last year when the German Navy officially refused to enter the ship's operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss farm in Hamburg.
This was the first case when the fleet returned to the ship’s crew after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, but German SMEs referred to a number of critical “programme and equipment defects” that made the warship useless in the use of the war.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as Baden-Wurtemberg's court would operate on a crew of about 120 seafarers — only half of the workforce in the old Bremen class.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy to reduce its productivity and limit the ability of the IMF to introduce innovations in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes of the Rhineland-Palatz were twice as heavy as those of the same class that were used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong equipment, the value of the whole project, including the training of the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of detention on which new brakes are being especially important in the light of recent warnings of the reduction of German military and maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the military and maritime forces had indeed “required the stock of ships capable of deployment”.
The officer said that the problem was time-consuming, as old ships had been driven out of operation, but their ships had not been provided for.
He visited that none of Baden-Wurtemberg's classmates could take the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of flying mice
A new study carried out in one of the far corners of Scotland is designed to show how flies use landshaft in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data obtained will re-examine the conduct of unique micro-organisms and assist in further conservation activities.
A study organized by the Scottish National Fund for Science will examine the traditional non-polluteries, sopranoses, as well as the roots of the long-lasting muscle healings and dobanton nights of Inverwe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registries will be established in some areas around the place to monitor the operations of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using manual detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls as well as the types of activities that different groups of these animals are responsible for.
Then a live environment map will be drawn up and a report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on landshaft.
Rob Duar, a natural conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that these results will show which places of residence are the most important and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of management of habitat management, such as the formation of lakes, as well as the way in which forest masses are maintained, optimal for liquefied mice and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk of disappearing because of construction and development work that affects their housing and the loss of the living environment.
Wind turbines and lighting facilities may pose a danger, as well as a soft band, chemical processing of building materials and cleaning of household boilers.
Actually, the muscles are not blind.
However, their nightly lodgings are usually such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complex eco-location technique to accurately identify obstacles to flight travel.
NTS, which is responsible for handling over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant buildings and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of the flying fish.
Ten trained experts are working in the organization, regularly conducting examinations, exit checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only reserve of flyers in Scotland instead of Treve in Dampris and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish flyers live.
David Thompson, the managing director of mobility, says that property is an ideal territory for them.
“This is a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good living environment.
But many of the flying mice remain unknown, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they are needed for the well-being of the people."
He recalled the importance of checking the presence of flying mice prior to technical services within private authorities, so that the unintended destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 individuals and young persons, and perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
The flying mice are protected by law, destruction, destruction or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Office for the Conservation of Birds, calls on the public to help.
She says, "There are many more that we have to know about our bones. We do not know how many different kinds of them live."
Ronalda rejects the charges of rape and his lawyers are going to be brought to court in the German magazine
Christina Ronalda rejects the charges against him, calling them “female news”, and claims that people simply “wanted to get away” using his name.
His lawyers are going to be brought to court at the German newsmagazine Schpiel, who filed charges against the footballist.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus were charged with rape by American name, Catherine Mayorg, who had a place in the hotel number Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 in order to talk about the incident, reported on the fifth "Spigel".
Speaking in a video in Instagram, with 142 million subscribers following a few hours after reporting charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information “female news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is all the fictional news,” says the 5th winner of Ballon d'Or on the camera.
“They just want to disappear, using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be marked by my name, but it's just part of their work.
I’m a happy person, and I’m always having a great time. ”
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to file to the Spigel court for charges they have called “unacceptable information on suspects in the field of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc stated that the game was intended to require compensation for “a moral damage to the extent relevant to the seriousness of legal violations, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Having met at the club at night, Ronalda and Mayorga had returned to the playroom, where he suspected that he had raped her in an anal form, according to the documents given to the Clarca District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo stood on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent of a good guy, but he was injured by one per cent”.
The documents state that Ronalda confirmed that the couple were having sex, but that was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and that the hospital had taken photos of her trauma, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “dangerous that she would suffer” and was afraid of“ public humiliation”.
34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change the place of residence, as she continued to experience the trauma caused by the alleged incident.
Ronald agreed to join Real Madrid from Manchester Union during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian Yuwe giants for 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “Asks for car manufacturers who have always been lost”
The Minister for Business and Enterprise Greg Clark stated that Britain “will always regret it” if Brexit lost its status as a world leader in car production.
He also commented on the fact that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that, if Britain comes out of the EU without a deal, it will temporarily cease its production in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the effects of border delays if there was no trade within Brexit could result in loss of jobs.
In Bernaston, Toyota Auris and Avenis are produced and released almost 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, production on our farm will be resumed," says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Great Britain expressed concern about EU exit without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to the fact that, in the absence of Brexit supply chain transactions, car manufacturers are at a greater risk.
The Toyota production line shall be launched “at exactly the right time” and details for vehicles manufactured by order shall be provided by suppliers of Britain and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be difficulties at the border which, according to the representatives of the industry, can lead to delays and shortcomings.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to store stocks on its premises in Derbyshire for more than one day, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Terez May plan, called in the Czechs, on future relations with the EU, was "really calibrated to avoid these border checks".
“We need a deal: we want to conclude a better agreement, which will allow me to repeat, not only to achieve success now but also to use this opportunity in the future,” he said in the effigy of the BBC Radio 4 programme “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to clarify the duration of the production, but in a longer-term perspective, it had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the profession and would ultimately lead to reduced jobs.
Peter Cavallaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the trade union, says that the concern of the members of the organization is growing: “My experience, if we lose these jobs, we can’t return them anymore.”
The representative of the Government says: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU”.
The Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed on information from the White House
The Donald Tramp's meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rozenstein could be "transferd to another week", as the struggle for Brett Kavano's candidate continues to be a case for the Supreme Court, and the White House announced in the resurrection.
Rosenstein is investigating the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the link between the supporters of the Treaty and Russia and the potential obstacles to justice by the President.
Whether the Deputy Prosecutor General's Trust will be removed from office, thus endangering Muller's independence, there has been a lot of evidence in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a forum to record talks with the Treaty and the possibility of the President with the help of the amendment 25.
Rosstein is investigating this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House in order to get away.
Instead, a meeting with the Tempp was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said he “would not begin” to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended to avoid contact with the Senate ' s judicial committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Cristina Blaise Ford gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump was scheduled to conduct a weekly investigation on the complaints of the FBR in Cavano, which further stopped the full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News in the resurrection.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press in the course."
Some journalists object to this claim: Sanders did not perform briefings at the White House on 10 September.
The leader Chris Wallace was interested in why.
Sanders says that the lack of briefings is not caused by the "punishing" of television reporters, although she added, "I will not deny that they play public".
It proposed an increase in the number of direct contacts between the tramp and the press.
“The President holds more meetings in response to the questions of journalists than any other president before him”, she added, without adding the exact figures: “We have these figures.”
Sanders was convinced that the briefings would continue, but "if there is a direct opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions, that is much better than talking to me."
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, that is a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
The tram regularly answers questions from the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with seniors.
The press conference is a common practice.
The fact that the president's weird behavior was in front of the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer.
The Minister for Health calls on EU workers in Scotland to write a letter of concern to Brexit
The Minister of Health has called on EU staff working in the Scottish GSP to express appreciation for the country ' s ownership and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed the letter to staff less than six months before the EU's arrival from Great Britain.
The Government of Scotland has already made a commitment to cover the cost of making statements on the status of EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit continued, and this step must be taken.
However, the Government of Great Britain is also strengthening the preparation of a possible scenario with no transaction.
I know this must be very, very anxious time for all of you.
That is why I now want to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows with the whole EU and beyond will bring valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercromby has carried out an extensive head injury operation
Michael Organ from Tennessee reported that the Tennissian State Tigers, Christian Abercromby, transferred an extraneous operation, received a head injury on Saturday after the 31th to 27th of the Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief trainer in Tennessee, Rod Reid, told journalists that the trauma was received shortly before the break.
"He went up to the side line and just moved there," said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombies oxygen on the side line before placing it on the back of the arm and carrying it to a medical examination.
The official representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombies had been operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details about the type/level of trauma”, and in Tennessee they try to figure out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercromby, only on the second course, it was the first season in Tennessee City after the transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully caught five cats, which amounted to 18 cats per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher Serbian collection for the purchase of real estate in Great Britain.
In accordance with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will take a higher host collection for the purchase of real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to assist homeless people.
This step leads to the net results of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
A higher herd will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The figure expects it to collect up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless persons
The foreign buyers will take a higher Serbian collection on the purchase of real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to assist homeless people, as Teresa May announced today.
This step has led to Corbin ' s attempt to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase citizens ' income.
The increase in the gross collection will be taken from natural persons and non-tax firms in Britain, and additional funds thus issued should encourage the Government's efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The addition to the existing hybrid collection, including an increase made two years ago for the acquisition of secondary housing and rental housing, may be up to three per cent.
It is expected that this step will provide up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London estates are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for purchasers to improve their living conditions later on.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “city examples” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy was developed a few weeks later, after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the Serbian congregation to help a larger number of young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of charging prices for real estate, purchased land, but actually not using them, and called on Mrs. May to withdraw from the quota available for housing in order to correct the “watchful situation with housing” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include controlling rent payments and ending unreasonably expulsion.
He also wanted to give local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I dedicated my sovereignty to the fulfillment of the British dream, so that life would become better with every new generation.
This, including the solution to the problems on our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is unfair that people who are not British citizens, as well as foreign companies, have access to real estate as well as to British workers.
For too many people, the dream of buying their own house has become too far, and the threat of some being on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: My final goal is to manage Scotland
Boss Sunderland Club Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become a certain stage manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish is satisfied with the restoration of the North-East Club, which is now the third place in the first league, separated from the first three.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after he returned to St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got Cap B, and everything," said Ross Sport Sound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at my father as a child for Scotland in Hampden, and that always attracted me back.
However, this will only be possible if I can become a successful club manager.”
The presidents of Rossa, the manager of Sunderland, were also Dica Lawyers, David Moies, Sam Heirdez, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kein, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said that he had not tried a test before such authoritarian names in such large clubs, as he had previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me success at this point will depend on whether I can return this club to the Prime Minister.
According to its structure and opportunities, this club will certainly belong to the Prime Minister," said the trainer.
“Get him out of there is a difficult task, but I will think that I have done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross worked for three years as a manager, starting with the assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at the Hearts Train Station.
He then helped Alla get up from the third level, and in the next season he took St. Mirren from the lower positions in the champion's winner.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepolol, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It must have been this cross,” he recalls his work in Alla.
"I sincerely believed that management was more appropriate to me than the game.
That sounds strange, because I've done everything well, I've worked very hard on this job and made some progress.
But the game is harder.
There's a lot to do every week.
I'm still under pressure at work, but I feel good at the manager's job.
I always wanted to guide, and now, by doing so, I feel the most comfortable of all the fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.”
You can listen to a full interview at Sports Sound on September 30, on Scotland radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the survey, 17:30 is the ideal time for beer paints
The summer summer brought the sale of British papacy, but it reduced the sale of restaurants.
According to statistics, the sale of potatoes and bars in July increased by 2.7 per cent and in restaurants by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin from CGA, who received this statistics, says: “The long-term solar activity, as well as the longer it was expected, the participation of England in the World Championship meant that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when the sales in cotton increased by 2.8 per cent and in restaurants, on the other hand, significantly decreased.”
The June fall in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent continued in July.
Peaches and barbes sold in spirit have shown much higher results compared with restaurants.
Babies that sell only food also suffer from sunlight, although not as strong as the restaurant.
It's a feeling that people want to jump out the street just to miss the shooter.
The sale of beer and beer increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food was by 3 per cent".
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the field of long-term and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we observe since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sports events remain key factors when it comes to market sales.
It is not surprising that the restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, since sales fall by 4.8 per cent per cent per annum will be particularly painful because of continuing price pressure.
It has been a long summer that has never been the case for ice-working operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, with more moderate temperatures, will provide such a necessary transition.”
The overall growth in cotton and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of branding.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry's monitoring of the British pop, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes the productivity of 47 networks with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds of stellings and is a recognised industrial steel.
Every fifth child has secret accounts on social networks that he is hiding from parents
According to the survey, every fifth child, some 11 years of age, has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the Facebook page
This news has intensified the fear of the content of sexual activity
Twenty per cent of the students said they have a "primary" account that parents know about
However, every fifth child, some 11 years of age, creates an account in the cells that he hides from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of Facebook accounts, i.e. Instagram, a site for the exchange of photos.
This news has intensified the fear of the publications of the content of the sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of the students stated that they had a basic, clean account that had access to their parents, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally obtained access to the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, moved there to an adult who called on others to “enforce him”.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in their cells, and half of them recognized that one of them was generally secret.
HMC Mike Bukenen's head says: “Many adults are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and that is a disturbing fact.”
Ellid Doyle will become the "voice of sportsmen" of the Scottish Light Attic
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of the Scottish Light Attraction as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most titled Scottish athlete on easy athletics, and President Jan Bitty claims that this step is an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports to make use of the extensive experience of sports at the international level over the last decade.
“Elid is enjoying great respect in the Scottish, British and World Light Atlantic Community, and we are confident that its participation will bring great benefit to Scotland,” she says.
Doyle says, "I want to become a sportsman's voice, and I hope that I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now working with a number of BBC commentators, who lost the ability to walk after the transfer of the insulin.
He writes in his Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said it's only time to show me if I can fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was a shame job, but I was completely cured, and I learned to walk again, and today I practice fishing!
Thank you so much for your support."
Advertisement of milk osteoporosis, in which breast-feeding mothers share the views of Internet users
The milk-producing company called for disputes on the Internet, publishing a advertising that compares breast-feeding with breast-feeding.
By placing on the market, as they say, “the world's first free milk to carry on the breast”, Elvie published a advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk milk is providing to breast-feeding mothers.
The four real moms dance in the full-time corner of the kitchen under a musical track, with the words, "Yes, I'm running with my own milk, but you won't see me sick" and, "If you don't notice, it's not wise, it's my heart."
And the cry shall be, 'We are to deliver, we are to deliver; we are to deliver, we are to be delivered.'
This advertising role, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised online disputes.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: The video has received a series of responses from viewers, and many say that it shines light into the milk industry.
“It was a bad decision to use the cows for the advertising of this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their children take them for a few days after birth," says one user.
Elvie molluscs are dressed directly under the special buffer (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “It is obviously equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk for mothers who leave their children alone?"
Another user adds: “Reclaim removed from reality.”
Others, on the other hand, protected the role, and one woman even wrote that the song “just great. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were a kid, I'd be obliged to buy that.
The heart beat really made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is, of course, a little clumsy, but maybe it feels that way.
A generic product” wrote one user.
Another comment was: “A procrastination report on a mother who wears a chest (often they do it directly at her workplace or in the toilets) and who, in fact, feel a little "cocks."
This is not to celebrate or consume our milk industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women showed that they were all dancing with these undetected milk sauces that were under the belts.
The concept of this advertising campaign is often based on the fact that many pregnant women say that they feel lonely.
In fact, Elvie's milk can be absolutely unsatisfied, without any transportation or garbage, and is free to be placed in the laundry for cooking, while unsatisfied, allowing women to move, hold little children, and even go out on the street during pregnancy.
Anna Balarin, a partner and child development specialist in Mother’s company, comments: “Molokotossos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a strong and provocative advertising.
By conducting a parallel between women and pregnant cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, thereby demonstrating the amazing sense of freedom that gives new milk.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk is falling into the headlines of news.
During the London Week, the mother of two children appeared on the floor of the designer of Mart Jacobs, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children have safely moved to a camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trampa administration have made it difficult for children to be placed in the hands of the authors.
Most sponsors are usually the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to risk their stay in the country, and they have taken the child under the command of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential contractors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified at the Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who had requested to be trained without the protection of minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested were not indicted before.
“About 80 per cent of persons who are either the sponsors or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
That is why we continue to persecute these people," said Albens.
With a view to speeding up the process of child training, the officials introduced new rules that some of them should appear before the court within a month of detention, not after 60 days as previously.
In order to claim their legal status as a judge on immigration cases, many of them are present on video media rather than on their own.
Those who are considered not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
According to reception workers and information that has occurred in the system in recent months, more children remain in detention, the likelihood that they are overwhelmed by anxiety or depression, which may lead to the outbreak of violence or attempted escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are being intensified in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs that the child is experiencing difficulties will most likely be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that carrying children into the palace camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or to spend time with friends can reduce the burden many of them are already struggling with.
Syria directs the “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw the army
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mullam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war had already taken place in the country for eight years.
Muala, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on the Syrian territory illegally, with the proposal to combat terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must go immediately and without any conditions”, he said to the assembled crowd.
Mualam insists that in Syria, where more than 36,000,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “war against terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus would continue to “send this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and from “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed around 2000 military personnel in Syria, who are primarily trained and consulted by both Kurdish and Syrian Arab leaders against President Basar Assad.
The French contingent accounts for more than 1,000 military personnel in the occupied war country.
In the case of refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been established for their return and charged “some Western countries” with spreading irradiation insurance, which forced refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to the return of civilians,” he said.
“They policy on what must be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to cease the war is reached.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone at the latest on the Idlib rebels created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a wide-ranging attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “a fixed time” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including the fighters from the Al-Qaida front of Nussra, who “will be destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened soon, consisting of a meeting of government representatives and opposition to develop a post-constitution constitution for Syria and propose a path to the election.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in this committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “examined articles of the current Constitution” and a warning of interference.
Why Trip wins the second time
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the election in 2020 if the impression and scandal do not pre-close his presidency, which is probably the hope of many liberal observers.
And this will certainly be “the very dramatic end of the presidency for all history.”
At this point, there are no signs of the blindness of the viewers.
From 2014, prime time ratings increased by more than two — up to 1.05 million CNN and nearly three times by 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premium-time viewers compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddo Show" has taken over cable channels by bringing 3.5 million viewers to the screen at night during the main news show.
“It is a fire to which people suffer because it is beyond our understanding”, says Nil Beer, director of the ABC drama “A significant survivor”, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skwell, a former comedian writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant facts about the discovery of Hollywood Boys” suggests another theory.
She recalls how she once went to a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trampa.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "That is because he is funny."
In all this chaos there is something precious — a joy.
Of course, unlike the rest of the television-transmitted content, Washington’s combined lines of events can determine the future of the Roo v. Wieda and respond to the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the world economy.
The exception is the age limit that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you've been looking at the expert group for six hours to discuss the use of Bob Woodward for his book "Strates", or about Paul Manafort's box of $15,000 from the Straussian skin (dwelling, burned throat), or a brief description by St. Daniels, we say, Mr. Trampa's anatoms are already coming out of ordinary information.
For example, I never look at Super Mario with eyes.
“His part of his work to make us feel that the reality of the show is that he's going to beat you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director Wheelhouse Entertainment and Pawn Stars on the changing activist composition of the Trampa show and the daily rotations of the compound (Dr. N.F.L., honouring Kim Chen Yina).
You can't let yourself miss any episode or you're hopelessly gone.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the north coast of Kaway, the sun lit, but he hid inside his house and saw MSNBC at the time of CNN.
He could not leave the screen, at least not exactly when it was shown how Brett Kavano was presenting before the Senate Legal Committee and decided to come to the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all these confusing shows, people said, "It was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleis.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Autsaider money is involved in the worst intermediate elections leading to the White House
It is no wonder that the 17th district of Pennsylvania has received the flow of availability through the change in the districts of the Congress, where two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This fertile area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so recently, supports democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of the Conor Lamb, who has been placed in another district in the extraordinary elections of the past.
Lamb is speaking against another active official, the Republic of China Rotfus, who is currently represented by the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly exceeded by the new 17th century.
The cards were reviewed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that, as a result of pre-election machines, the old areas had been registered by the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
In the new 17th district, Hong Kong launched a heated discussion on the financing of the campaign between the financial forces of the main party — the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NCRC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after the victory with a small difference to the widely observed special elections in March in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Tramp has won a round of 20 prizes.
Political experts have given the Democrats little advantage.
The United States has ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing as a negative reaction to Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Vareloy, who was also in Panama until partners had left the management team of the organization of the Trampa.
The representatives of the Department decided to withdraw from the American leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent non-recognition decisions of Taiwan”, the press secretary of the Department of State of Hezer Nauart announced early this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only with respect to El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed tax sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the target visa restrictions, would be a disease for Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
On the basis of regular meetings, representatives of the North and Central America held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was followed by a similar meeting that took place last year, which took place as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration in the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior representatives of the Administration understood that they wanted the preparation of the conference to continue, and actually stopped considering El Salvador ' s punishment.
According to the diplomats, the conference was scheduled for mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens to indicate that the administration has made the meeting really important.
Three American diplomatic representatives had voluntarily returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having received any new violent messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates of three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues under anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the side analysis of the administration, but also referred to anonymity.
Learn History
The next step could be the communication of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possibility of preventing Mr. Trampa from justice, which is currently very important evidence in public records.
Mr. Muller, he also reported, was investigating the existence of the arguments of the Trampa campaign with Russia and its attacks during the previous elections.
If the Congress changes its business, Mr. Tramp is presenting responsibility in this body, just as he is ready to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of 'if'; I do not mean that Mr. Trampa's fall is inevitable, as is his fall in Europe.
We all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which is about the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set up a coup and overthrow Hitler, and that would have been the case if the West had been opposed and supported by the Czech army in Munich.
However, we did not, and this allowed us to avoid the following years of bloodshed.
The course of history is being developed on such points, and the unfavourable march of democracy is speeding up or halting.
The Americans are experiencing some of these extreme moments right now.
What would we do if Mr. Tramp killed the Deputy General Prosecutor General Roda Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the paper, he has proposed a secret record of the president's activities last year and has discussed his inadmissibility to the post.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that The Times data are false.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBR investigation concerning Brett Kavano is not complete or true, or if all of it is approved by the Supreme Court in spite of the credible allegations of sexual harassment and false evidence?
And above all, will we, in the medium term, vote for Congress, which will bring Mr. Trampa to responsibility?
If we don't pass these tests properly, this winter is too heavy for democracy.
But I believe we can go through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to the Osvens by the same Nazi regime that the officials had once occupied a house in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she forced me to break the Sabbath candles on the table with the symbol of the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with my family?'
Norman Eisen, the senior scientist of the Brookings Institute, is the president of the City of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of the book “Last quarter: the concerned century of Europe in the history of five lives and one legendary home”.
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Venetian Football Club Rapid.
The Rangers adopted the Vienna Rapid Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians, after impressing nothing in Spain over the Wilderreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe.
The trauma of the knee moved to the defense of Graham Dorrans first to speak before the session with account 2:2 against Villarreala, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trauma to achieve great results.
"It was a good moment for us, because Wilderreal was a good team," said a 31-year-old football player.
"We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we went with nothing.
Perhaps at the end of the day, we were able to deal with it, but in general nothing was likely to be a fair outcome.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came to the second time where we were better.
There's another big European night this Thursday.
I hope we can get three shots, but this will be a hard game because they have shown good results in their last game, but I am sure that we can move forward and get positive results.
The past year has certainly been hard, taking into account all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is well improved, and children are really satisfied with this; training has gone on to “hours”.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the previous season and succeed."
Women lose sleep out of fear of their pensions
Despite having a clear picture of how they wanted to be concerned, few spoke to their family.
About half of the people involved in the national study said that they had discussed with their wives the value of long - term care.
However, only 10% said they were talking to their children on this subject.
“People want to know about them, but they don’t try to discuss it with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide.
That's what we have to do.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family for them if you do not wish to do so.
Discuss with your consultant and family, where and how you will receive medical assistance, as this choice may be an important factor in expenditure.
Consult with your financial consultant: he will help you develop a plan for the costs.
Your selection of long-term care funding may be covered by the traditional long-term care insurance policy or mixed life insurance policy that will help to cover these costs or to protect yourself with the help of your own property, provided that you have money.
Bring in your legal documents: save yourself from legal battalions.
Build trust in medical services and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical service and monitor the performance of your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended that we consider the possibility of financial reliability.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts if you feel inadequate.
Do not forget, too, that your loved one needs immediate medical help, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you, in this case, provide information on what medication he is taking and on what allergy he has?
Write all these details in a book so that you can prepare for each case.
Martin adds: “It is not only the availability of funds but also the choice of doctors.”
"What medicines do you take?
Who's gonna care about your dog?
Make and record this plan."
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times from a pneumatic window.
A man shot several times from a pneumatic window, returning home from playing games.
The victim, in the chest, life and arm that had been burned, was 40 years old in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police characterised the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30, in English summer, as “cool”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, the police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official figures, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunamis in the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, and it is expected that the number of dead will grow.
As a result of the arrival of communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donghal, the region north of Palu, which is located near the earthquake site of the 7.5 ball.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palau as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Donghal, located on the island of Solavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a short bay on the west coast of the island of Solavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (in 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis took place.
Donggala is a district that extends up to 300 km (180 km) of the coastal line to the north-west of the island of Sulavesi.
In 2017 there were 299,200 people in the Administrative Area of the Minorities.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Province of Central Sulvaes, in particular the coastal region of the Donggal region.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the economy of the province, but mainly focused in Moroval, on the opposite side of the island of Solavesi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Management Agency, in the past 100 years, several times the destructions in Palu and Donggal have been caused.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunamis also occurred in the western part of Tonga in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic volcano and suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ache on 26 December caused tsunamis in 14 countries that killed 226,000 people near the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Ache.
2005: In the end of March and early April, the consequences of heavy landfills fell on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Neas, in the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 South Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, caused tsunamis on the southern coast, resulting in the death of some 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 bollocks occurred on one of the Isle of Mantawa in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 feet [10 m] that destroyed ten trees and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake broke out in the area of Pidi Jaja in Ache, causing destruction and panic, as people have remembered the 2004 earthquake and tsunamis.
The tsunami did not occur this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have devastated the island of Indonesia Lombok, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained in ruins for a time.
The oldest son of Sari Pelin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Pelin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaski and vice-president of the president of Sira Pelin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Pailin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence in a situation where domestic violence occurred and for the opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the police of the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a prominent man tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he chose her phone.
According to KTUU, Peelin is in the Mat-Su investigation facility and will be released at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “excusable innocence.”
The burning of three small offences in Class A is a threat, which means that it may be deprived of a period of one year and spent at $250,000.
He was also charged with the crime of Class B, which had been sentenced to a period of up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first case when criminal charges against Pellina were filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sara Pelin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the veteran court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, the sale of family violence and the storage of weapons in the circumstances of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her face.
Sara Pelin was criticized by the Veterans Group in 2016 after explaining his son's ill-treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his services in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people were killed as a result of earthquakes on the Indonesian island of Solavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 volleyball earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will grow in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred shortly after the Central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The social networks show video recordings of the event.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Paula when the tsunami broke out in the mountains.
The Federal Prosecutor wishes to bring a rare death sentence to the suspect in New York
The federal prosecutor in New York was sentenced to death for Saiful Saipov, suspected of performing the earthquake in New York, resulting in the death of eight people, a rare punishment for federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October Saipov, 30 years old, they took some home Depot truck to attack the six West Side Road, in Lower Manhattan, hit by passengers and passengers.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov had “probably” killed eight people and that the ships had been subjected to serious physical injuries, according to a notification of his intention to receive a death penalty in the South of New York.
According to the court document, there may be a death sentence on both of these charges.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury had sentenced Saipov to 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of murder for the record used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as violence and car destruction.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “very planned and planned”, Saipov carried it out, as described, “simply, viciously and criminally”.
"Syfullo Habibullaević Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Loror Dekad, Darrena Dreyka, Ariel Erlia, Erna Ferruchi, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnukko," states the report.
Five of the missing were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years ago, in the South New York area, the prosecutor needed a death sentence.
In September 2009, the accused Halid Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The death penalty for federal cases in New York was last applied in 1953 in relation to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to a contract for spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rozenbergi was executed on 19 June 1953.
According to the Saipov case documents, Uzbek's teacher demonstrated the lack of disbandation after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch the IGIL video on the phone when he was attacked.
He also asked to bring the IGIL flag to his hospital room, the police reported.
He rejects his guilt for all 22 counts of conviction.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on the side of Saipov, said that they were “exploited” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not the life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only eliminate the pain of these events for all their participants,” said Patton.
Saipova's protection had previously appealed to the prosecutors with a request not to receive a death penalty.
A member of the Parliament of Tori said that NAYJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraj conference, the people ' s army was “mobilizing”.
Former leader Ukip said that policies should be "feeling like" Eurosceptics, as a member of the Teresa parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bown, a member of the Conservative Party, told the Mitinger in Birmingham that Britain would already "go", if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May, trying to calm her deeply divided ranks is further compounded by the fact that the members of the Tori Party, who are opposed to EU exit, join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan, called in Chekers in the wake of an attack by the Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and liborists to choose between her package and her "haos".
Mr. Bown told the lecturer Leave Means Leave in Solichall that he wanted to play the Chuckers.
He proposed that Mr. Faraž be moderated and responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
He said, “Had he been responsible, we would have gone away.”
Members of Velingboro added: "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play the Czechs."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in the world wars to be independent.
We wish to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their opinion and that they want to remain completely out of line with reality.”
Journalist Brexit of Tori Andrea Jenkins' party was also presenting comments to journalists: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“Checkers is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also not popular among the members of our party and our activists, who actually push the streets and first select us.
Please leave the Czechs side and listen to what they say.”
In her brief address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Minister will remain in his office, if they remain faithful to their promise.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies were to make a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum, they needed to stop “feeling naked”.
"This is now the issue of trust between us, people, and our political class," he says.
"They're trying to pass Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let you down."
Turning to the confused crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is at the border of Brexit, to feel closer.
“We are mobilized by the people’s army of this country, which brings us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
At the time, Brexit's opponents went through a demonstration in Bergingham and then held a two-hour rally at the city center.
Several activists were mixing Tori v. Brexit's posters in these outputs.
At the opening of a conference of a member of the Liberian Party, Lord Adonis criticized conservators for the safety problems of their party ' s mobile application.
“And these people claim that they can set up Canada's ICT and technology plus, for work at the borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is one of the two sides of the road.
The good Brexit does not exist in principle," he says.
Warren plans to "extended" the opportunity to participate in the presidential run
A member of the United States Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections, she would “study to study the possibilities of balloting in the presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that a Moscow Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future at a meeting of soldiers in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a member of the presidential criticism of Donald Tramp, was voted against in November against the member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dila, who was co-chaired by the Trampa campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Talks are being held that it has the opportunity to post the Trampa in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with the voters; since the beginning of her post, it has been her 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a round-up meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to fly to the president's post.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to "start" our corrupt government and that it would require a woman to be up there.”
As a result of Simsa's murder, the LSU game was under arrest
The Baton Rouge Police, the state of Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (strength) of LSU Wyad Sims, who had been arrested on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 after the English press conference, Baton-Ruj police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old .
On Friday, the Police Department published video shoots asking for help to identify the person who was able to remove the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot around South University campus on Friday morning.
“Oyed Sims received a shot at the head that ended,” said the chief of police, Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade came in for his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been involved in the incident, had weapons with him, and had shot him in Wade Sims.
During the arrest, Simpson was not opposed and was detained in the East Baton Rouge district police.
A young man grew up at 1 m 82 cm in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and played in the middle of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 shots and 2.9 game teams.
Gran At Russia: Luis Hamilton is approaching the title of the world champion after the command tactic gave him victory over Sebastian Fattel
Since Walter Botts passed his qualification on Saturday, Luis Hamilton, it has become clear that the Merses command tactic plays a major role in the race.
With half-push Botts, he was well-started and practically dependent on Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two rounds and invited Fettel to attack his teammates.
The party first went to the pist stop, leaving Hamilton in the corner of the whole group a choice that would be decisive.
Mercedes went up to the pith-stairs one round down, and then to the back of the Fettel, but Hamilton, after some collusion battle, stepped forward that the Ferrari driver suddenly left the inner space free, risking to sink after a double movement to protect the third floor.
On his 21st day of birth, Max Ferstappen started off a series of networks and was on the seventh floor at the end of the first round.
After that, he drove most of the race, held on the family tracks, to finish it quickly, and moved Kim Reikkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he went up to the peak at the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds, as Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was difficult because Walter had done fantastic work on the outside and had shown this kindness by sharing it with me.
The team did such an extraordinary job to have a pair of trolls in stock," Hamilton said.
Inquiry of the host language
President Donald Tramp criticised Senator Diane Finstein's meeting with the voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not publish a letter from Christina Blaise Ford, accused of Brett Cavano, a candidate for the Supreme Court, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not recall the direct statements made by the Forum before the Senate Legal Committee, saying that the participants in the Senate showed that the events were “low, thin and lying people”.
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate, is great, it's anger, evil, cruelty and lies,” he said.
You will see all of them running away. Then they will say, "No, I did not do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Fynstein, did you send the information?
Remember her answer... did you send the information to the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't promise.
Yeah, stop.
We, what, did we? No, we didn't, he added to the senator's introductory.
In July Finstein was sent a letter with a detailed statement of charges made by the Forum against Cavano, and in early September it was unlawfully declared, but Finstein denied that the flight had occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t share her information,” said Finnstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she requested.”
However, the manner in which she refused to apologize in the run did not seem to favor the president, who commented on it during the sub-mission: "What I say to you is that the tongue of the body has made it very good.
It may not be that she has spoken it, but the tongue of the body is worse than what I have seen."
The President, while continuing to protect his candidate at the post of the Supreme Judge, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, suggested that democracy was using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to return their authority in all the available ways.
We observe the subsistency, the misery, the misery, and the extent to which they are trying to go through to gain power and control," the President quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: Dandi Stars 5-3 Belfast Janets
Patrick Duyer killed two holes for "Jiants" in a game against "Dandy"
In the game of Elite hockey, Dandi Stars was paid for a fifth assault on Belfast Janets, winning the corresponding match on Saturday with the account 5-3 on Dani.
Janets received an early advantage in two rounds thanks to the beatings of Patrick Duier and Francis Bowler.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Kouni raised the household team level before Dowier took Jaiants to the leader.
France Bush compared the "Danney" account, before the two voices of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen confirmed their victory.
For the people of Adam Kifa, who won Dani's victory at 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third plague in the season of the Elite League.
It was the fourth meeting of the parties in the season when Janets won three previous matches.
The first round of Duiere arrived at 3:35 after the main pass of Kendall McFolla with the support of David Rezerford, after which Boulier doubled the privilege of four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sallivan returned players in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markwardt helped Connie to calculate the account at 15:16.
The Duyer confirmed that Jaiants took the initiative in the first round when he killed the second floor at the end of the first period.
Hosea was regrouped, and Bush returned to the account, killing the head with a number of transfers at 27:37.
Kouni and Charles Corcoran were united to help Nilsen to give Dani the opportunity to take the lead at the end of the second period, after which he, together with his team, won the victory, held opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jaiants, the last four of the five missing mothers, are sent to Milton Kenns for the next match, which will be held on Friday.
The aircraft inspector died in order to avoid earthquakes by hundreds of people on board the aircraft
The Indonesian air inspector was sentenced to death by a hero after being informed of his death in order to have an aircraft with hundreds of passengers safely out.
More than 800 people have died and many have died without news as a result of a massive earthquake on the island of Sulavesi on the fifth of the tsunamis.
Strong underground towers continue to destroy this area, and many of the inhabitants of the city of Paula were under the walls of buildings.
Although his colleagues were saved by escape for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a dreadfully dissipated airport of Mutira Sis Al-Jufri, the city of Paul.
He remained on his way to prove that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then in the air-conditioning field, was safe.
Then, when it was shown to him that the tower was broken, he ran away with it.
He ended up in the hospital later.
The representative of Indonesia's air navigation officer Johannes Sirait stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimanton to deliver it to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the dissident ended before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are very sorry about this loss," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of people who have been killed as a result of earthquakes could reach thousands, as the information provided by the disaster relief agencies has limited access to the cities of Tonga, Sigi and Butong.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, as a large number of people are still under siege, and many have not been able to choose from there,” says the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The wave, which reached six feet [6 m], left the city of Paul, where the mass burial of the dead would take place in the resurrection.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance in the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Special assistance brings victims every minute.
Clean water is not enough.
The mines are all over the world.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “Indonesia Red Cross colleagues are already running to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will stay there.
The tragedy has already taken quite a heavy toll, but it can be much worse."
Indonesian President Jacques Vidodo came to Paul in the resurrection and spoke before the armed forces of the country, in particular, saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to meet all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
In early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombo, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that one person lost without news after the plane crash in the camp
The air carrier, carrying out a flight that had been damaged by the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia, is now reporting that one person had disappeared without news, as it had been said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had successfully left a flying plane.
Air Niugini reported that, as of Saturday, she had no information about a male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police in an attempt to find the person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on passengers, such as their age or nationality.
The local seamen helped save other passengers and aircraft after he landed on the water, trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers had been hospitalized on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The causes of the aviation disaster and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. airlines and WMS claim that the aircraft has landed in the cabin near the airport.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft could not land on the airfield.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane is getting to an air-conditioning area too low.
"And that's very good," adds Janes.
Janes said he and other passengers were able to get to the emergency exits on a ton of land, as the water level was on the ground.
He also said that the Stoards panicked and screamed on the ship and that he got a slight headache.
The U.S.S. reported that the mariners who repaired the near-surface also helped to rescue the ship they had brought to the shore before the plane was loaded about 30 feet (100 feet) above water.
The flight safety data show that in the last two decades, Air Niugini had lost 111 people, but none of them had any relation to Air Niugini.
Analytics on informed consent to prove that women are pregnant
On Saturday, the charges were raised against the men charged with marriage in 2014 by the inhabitants of Mississippi.
Analysis by the Department of Justice of the United States Paul Roullett provided a number of timely evidence as an expert in the analysis of the missing persons.
He told the members of the department how he used the mobile phone records to draw up a common picture of the action of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulette said he had received information about the location of these people on several mobile phones; according to that, on that night, Tellis spent time with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statements, reports The Clear Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, but according to the data received, his cell phone was close to Chambers; when the situation was resolved, the police called on the Singapore police.
In his statement he said that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Telis said the truth, claiming that the night was in Sanford's truck, Sandford said that "it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to telephone records, they were only scheduled for one week.
Roulette also showed that, shortly after the death of Chambers Telis removed her text messages, calls and contact information from her cell phone.
He says, “It is the star of her life.”
Protection should begin with its final arguments in the resurrection.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be handed over later that day.
The High Breed: what is this "known hip-hop"?
Trio hip-hoppers are trying to combat the negative attitude of this genre by filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that the content of the hip-hop has changed as a result of significant political and social problems.
The group's participants want to return to their roots and make the "recognised" hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become witnesses of rebirth in Britain, thanks to such artists as Akal and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York State passed a family sentence for racist purposes.
The New York Women ' s Court of the Family for the Prevention of Discrimination, after receiving a complaint from women, complained that she had not been “one more black”, which she mistakenly sent instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the search is "for the purpose of making a request".
Linci Plasco-Fleksman, the mother of two children, expressed concern, knowing that the new wedding proposed by the child care service, Jigel Morris, was blackmailed when she came into her family on her first working day in 2016.
"Not so much as another black one," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Fleksman in the mind of her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she had twice misjudged her husband, Mrs. Morris.
Acknowledging his grief, the “confused” Plasco-Fleksman killed Morris, claiming in service that nothing that happened to the Africans was doing his job badly, and in general that they were waiting for the Philippines, not the American, reports New York Post.
Morris paid for the job one day and then went home to Uber.
Morris is now in court on a family basis and requires compensation for the release of $350 a day for six months, under the terms of a specific oral agreement, which, however, was not concluded by any contract.
"I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable," she said on Friday, adding, "and I know that this is discrimination."
The spouses disagree with the charges of racism and claim that the release of Morris could be viewed as a reasonable step because, in trying, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her in a message that she did not really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, Post.
“And why did you not trust your children with whom you had been guilty, even if you were to be imprisoned?
Would you trust your newborn child?
That's good for you.
Calling his wife a child two months ago, he said that his wife had given birth to a child and had been in a difficult situation.
“Are you willing to persecute a man who is in such a state?
Not very nice of you," added a bank employee specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but the public opinion has already brought its judgment on social networks, accusing couples of unacceptable behaviour and logic problems.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not be able to walk with the speaker, says in a new letter.
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the publication was adopted, was so moved by the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the first person who reads the production before it was published.
It is a pleasure to know that Paddington has great success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a child book on the bear, had worked on BBC, and would refuse to publish it with optimism, and added that 60-year-old jubilees had been “happy and bitter” since their author had not been there last year.
With regard to Paddington's own nurse, she called him “a very important member of our family”, and her father was quietly proud that his staff at the end of the day had grown in knowledge.
"He was a quiet man," said his daughter.
“And Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success; he was proud, although he did not consider it a success for himself.
I think he was referring to Paddington's success in that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he was also always giving the proper ride."
I had to ask my dying daughter on the phone.
After the flight, her daughter was transferred to the Nicci Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called on us regularly and said that it was really bad that something was wrong," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes, and that we should be excused.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, enabling her to work, gradually stopped acting, leaving her body.
She died before she was expected.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that everything was going to end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I have come to hold my hands firmly."
At the end of Ms. Ednan Laperus, concerned about the loss of his daughter, the village was on a plane with other passengers, with a huge loss that she had just had to survive.
"No-one knew what had happened," she says.
"My head broke, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this profound feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed so much in my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have survived the loss of their loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are located on Welsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Miss Davis Taylor was 13 when he was depressed, and at the age of 18, he ended up with him.
“I don’t want other parents to test the same thing I try every day,” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says that her son was a great fighter and had a queer boutique.
"All of them loved his kiss.
They said, “When he is thirsty, the light will come down upon him.”
However, before his death, he left his job because he was living in a time of fear.”
This happened in 2014, and the man who ended up with Tyler found his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm not afraid of a cholera reaction."
Mrs. Davis thought of these openings, "because people knew that there was someone who could call and tell you everything, even if it was your friend.
I can't sit and listen, I need to talk to people."
Mrs. Hamfriz, who has been married to Miss Davis for many years, lost his wife, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, not shortly after his mother died.
She said, “He did not say that he felt confused, confused, or in a state of confusion.”
“After a few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his attitude.
It was especially bad for him in his birth. He did not even look at children when they discovered their gifts."
She says that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they should go through it, and this happened to our family.
It ruined her part.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Future Bretta Cavano hairdresser: FBI starts research
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — a time-limited investigation and amount, we could bring a little unity,” said Mr. Flyk on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "disrupt" on the basis of a growing party-based response.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the cause of their confusion.
The interlocutory elections will take place in five weeks, November 6, and if, as expected, everything will go wrong for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and select him as the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush calls on the senators, with the support of Mr. Kavano, who has been working in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who has met with his future wife, Ashley, then a personal secretary, Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI finds out its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
At the same time, it would not be clear whether Mr. Kavano would be able to get 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Penss to resolve the problem of equality of votes and confirm his application to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased in Kim
Since Kim Chen Yin had arrived in power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has been reduced, and a South Korean lawyer has said.
Again, in submission to the Ministry of the South, Ben Seug stated that, compared to the 2706 escape cases established in 2011, the figure dropped to 1127 last year.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors had increased border control between North Korea and China, as well as increased rates taken by the smuggling of people.
The general public comment is not given.
The resulting majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often underprivileged them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in the war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Beijing to resume the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of the Presidents of the United States of America, Donald Trampa and Kim Chen Yina, in Singapore, where they reached the common disarmament agreements on the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Riy Yun Ho, accused the United States of preventing progress in this matter by their sanctions.
“If we do not have little confidence in the United States, we will also lack confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot begin disarmament in a unilateral manner,” Mr. Rey said in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavano "extreme", and asserts that he is not willing to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, named Brett Kavano, a candidate at the Supreme Court ' s office, "sister" and said that he was not qualified for work in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t imagine that if a woman had ever allowed herself to behave in such a way, she would immediately be called a “stirk”,” says Pelosi about her reaction to Kavano's statement to the Legal Committee of Sena, given to them in Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's charge of sexual harassment, which was a place when they were both teenagers.
Cavano spoke emotionally, and in time he even fell on his knees and laughed, talking about his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the Committee's democracies, calling it “a gross and clearly planned murder of an active person”, organized by liberals who were disappointed that Hillary Clinton had missed the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, he merely confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was concerned with democracy.
“I think he is disqualifying himself with his own convictions, as well as with the way he refers to Clinton and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi replied when asked if she was in charge of Kavano, if his fault was confirmed, and if the democracies were to receive most of the representatives in the Palace.
"I will say this: if he does not speak the truth of Congress or the FBI, he will not only stand for the Supreme Court but also for the court in which he is now," said Pelosi.
Cavano is currently the judges of the District Appeal Court D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned by the possible decisions made by Cavano on access to health care Act or "Roo v. Waida", since she was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings of his candidate, Cavano raised the question of whether he would reject some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time to leave the arrogant and oppressed man at the office of the Supreme Judge, and to cry out, "How great!"," says Pelosi.
And women should be able to do this.
It's true anger, months, and years of light, she can't go through it without it.
"When we're wrong, we're crying," said Mrs. Stein, 45 down.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She continued, "The woman who worked for a position of guidance has helped me to say that she cried when she was ill, but has developed a technique which she has explained to her companion: 'You may think I am crying because I am upset.
In fact, I'm upset."
And then she just kept talking.
I've been impressed by this approach."
The tears are allowed to come out of anger because they are treated unjustly in the background.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office where men were dominated was that I once cried out of anger, but I understood the deep breath of the woman, the heartless manager that I was always afraid of, and turned into a wooden cell.
"Never let them see how you weep," she said to me.
They do not know that you cry for help.
They think that you are confused, and they rejoice, and they think that they have brought you the end.’
Patricia Shreder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught up in an intrusion and stepped out of the race, Mrs. Shreder, deeply disappointed, decided that there were no reasons for her to fight at the president's post.
“This decision was not to be considered,” she admitted with a smile 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates were already in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that Bellosnežka and seven crimes.
The campaign had already reached its end, it had given up a lot of money, and therefore it had claimed that it would not participate in the race unless it had collected $2 million.
It's said it was a perfectly abandoned option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, offered her only 250.
"What am I to them, that which is valued?" she wondered.
When she said that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, as well as the anger of discrimination on the grounds that she was breathing.
“You would think I have a nervous breakdown,” recalled Ms. Shreder about how the press reacted to it.
"It may have been thought that Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I still thought, "What are they writing on my memory?"
"She doesn't end up screaming?"
How a trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first decline in trade wars between the United States and China has been disgusting, and although the fight is still far from over, the divide between countries can lead to the long-term benefit of Beijing.
Donald Tramp, President of the United States, made the first warning early this year, on the tax of major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant auction took place this week when new tariffs affected goods amounting to $200 billion (150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming from the United States of China.
Beijing has each reported an equivalent response attack, recently establishing US$60 billion in sales of five to ten per cent.
China promised that responses to the United States would be equal each time, and the second on the scale of the world economy would hardly begin to test the smaller difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to give up means to accept claims, but to make the United States public would be too sensitive to Si Chipin, the president of China.
However, experts believe that, if Beijing can properly play its cards, the US-led war may provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic unrest in any of these countries, in fact, much more dangerous than former observers have recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security (Center for New American Security), specialized in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and calls for assistance in the restoration of a country that has been left out of war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid al-Mullam reported that conditions in the country improved.
“Today the situation on the ground has become more stable and safe thanks to the success of counter-terrorism”, he said.
The Government continues to restore the devastated areas so that people can live in peace there.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country to which they were forced to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives are being created.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mullam said that the Syrian regime would be blessed for helping to restore the damaged country.
But he stressed that the country would not receive assistance under any circumstances or assistance from countries that were sponsoring terrorism.
Europe confirms the victory of Kubke Rydera in Paris
The European team won Cubak Raider 2018, won the US team with a final account from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has already lost sixfold in Europe, and the European Cuboc Ryder has not won since 1993.
Europe returned to its homeland thanks to the command of the Danish Captain Thomas Bourne, who had taken 14,5 shells that they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who fought most of the tournament, made his first round in water on the 16th of Monday, par-3, his rival Francesco Mollinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won in all its rounds, became 1-x-4 games that once went 5-0-0, as the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit suffered a 5.4-game with the lowest rating in the European team, the Turbir Alesen from Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, introduced 2:1 Jan Polter from England, who may have been involved in the Cubca Rydera last time.
The Spanish Serhio Garsia, a veteran of eight Kubkov Ryder, has become the winner of a tournament for all of Europe's history with 25.5 spectators for careers.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cube again.
Everything is in the team, and I am glad that you can help," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed over to his co-founder John Ramu, who won the victory over the American legend golfer Tiger Woods with account 2:1 in a single game.
“I’m experiencing incredible pride for this victory — I’m growing up watching the game of Tiger Woods,” says 23-year-old Rome.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France, and his career record is now 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the greatest games of all time, won by only Jack Niclaus.
The United States of America fought throughout all its exits, trying hard to overcome, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the golf course of the highest school throughout the entire tournament.
The United States Captain Jim Führer said after a recent statement by his team: “I'm angry with these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to make it easy for Europe.
I didn't get it.
Let's take a shot in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 games were overplayed.
We are regrouping, I will work with the PGA America and our Committee on the Cubca Ryder, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 children, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to play.
We have lost."
Green: News of the micro-organisms ' concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The recent report of the Florida Fisheries and Dictual Commission reflected a general reduction in the concentration of fine-tuning in some parts of the Tampa region.
According to FWC, the areas of Pinellas, Manatita, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koler are reported to be highly colored, which refers to reducing the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Sea is spread about 130 miles from the northern Pinella to the southern area of Li.
Occasions can be observed about 10 miles away from the Hillsboro border, but their number has decreased significantly over the past few weeks.
The bluefin tuna is also observed in the area of Pasco.
Last week, the average concentration in and around Pinellas was reported, from low to high concentration in the Hillsboro coastal area, high concentration in the Manat and Sarasto districts and to coastal areas, medium concentration in the Charlotte area, high concentration in the area of Li, and low concentration in the area of Koler.
In the areas of Pinellas, Manatita, Sarasota, Li and Koler, there is still the likelihood of the dispersion of breathing pathways.
In the northwestern Florida, there was no reports of this probability last week.
