Members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that they will be ‘compared with Muppets’
The Members of the Wales National Assembly are asked to make a proposal to change their title in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to amend the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ in the ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of several political parties have been concerned that the new name will be changed accordingly.
A member of the National Meeting of Wales of the Labour Party said MWP ‘remotes on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for geek and pwp is Welsh for pop.
A member of the National Meeting of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘satisfied’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party ‘open state’ for the change of names, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar to each other.
In this context the Welsh letter W is addressed as a short one.
The Committee of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently involved in the creation of legislation to implement the change in names, said: 'Of course, the members of the Wales National Assembly themselves take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government or Wales Act 2017, members of the Wales National Assembly received the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, showing that most people felt that the National Assembly should be baptized to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Wells Parliament Members’ or ‘WMPs’, but the option MWP received most support in the public consultation.
The members of the National Assembly should now propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach consensus, and they must have a legislative proposal for the changes within a few weeks.
The Law on Reform also includes other amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will certainly be able to vote on their new title when they discuss the legislation.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
Every day voters vote or wish to change the name of their country in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organized in an effort to solve an intriguing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athens argues that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would appeal in its territory and has repeatedly challenged Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the change in names, said that he would not take account of the report of the referendum.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that the change in names is only the price to be paid to be a member of the EU and NATO.
The hours of Saint Martin's weak, which are hard for Harlem.
'The older people I talked to said that there was a coffee and a church in every corner earlier,' said Mr. Adams.
Today there's another coffee here, another church to spy on.'
He said it's understandable that coffee's gone.
'People now have social contact in another way,' he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the village, where people regularly walk.’
However, he makes sure that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will go less long than the leaders expect, ‘and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.’
Church, he adds, could be replaced by flat apartment buildings where the kind of people would live that would not help in the rest of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will lead to the conclusion that these churches will soon be closed, because it is unlikely that the people who move to such flats will become members of the church.’
Both churches have ever been built by a white church before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists was abandoned in the 1930s.
A black church from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who led a Boycott of the dealers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks but rarely could get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishes of Eervald Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a bicycle.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Johnson, and his successor in Saint Martin's, he called the beaard pride "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the piano in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural shadow’ and ‘an unreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first time in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger audience of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complex story of architects and adopters, some of whom were housed by the laymen of the church, others by the Bisdom.
The Consistory (the governing body of the parishion, consisting of medical leaders) wrote in July to express its concern that the Bisdom would ‘recognize the costs’ to the consistory, although the constitution was not involved in the introduction of the architects and recipients who sent the bisdom.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the bisdom.
Haai spends 13-year-olds who go to a dock in California
Saturday, on the first day of the Christmas season, a horse is a 13-year-old boy on the way to the dock in California. The young man was amazed, so it sounds.
The attack took place just 7 hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had spent about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he asked the boy for help. Together with some others he went to the boy to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought he was calling the boy because he had a brain, but then he realized that the boy cried: ‘ I’m praying!
I'm praying!'
His key legs were completely open," saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
'I cried that everyone had to go out of the water, 'There's a horse in the water!'
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was injured in a life-threatening accident.
It is not known what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told in a press conference that a shark was placed nearby a few weeks ago, but that it was then concluded that it was not going to be a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburys wants to break up on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competition with Boats, Superdrug and Debenhams and direct beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to overcome the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are sold in 11 stores throughout the country. If they appear to be successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
Investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the range of TVs, magnets and interior products.
Sainsburys wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twozerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also provides more space, with extra space per brand, such as in shops like Boats.
The supermarket also restores its Boutique-make-up on the market, now most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two stores of Saninsbury. The first was first opened in Croydon, south of London, the second will be opened this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and more often buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsburys, says that the shops will continue to look more like wholesale houses, now the supermarkets are recording it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsburys has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has opened a number of Habits since two years ago.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Apothec a makeup over, it was a fly.
Sainsbury's experiment began in the year 2000 with Boats, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose about the division of income from the apothecary department into the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 apothecaries in the shops three years ago for a total of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owned by the poet Lloyds Pharmacy.
Sounds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsburys, said: ‘We have completely changed the organization of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands we offer everything we want, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer buy them in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'heavy' after Holly Willoughby returns out of a deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'heavy' because TV representative Holly Willoughby has withdrawn himself from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand for home year and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is even compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old representative of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons It's off Holly Willoughby, because she's recently withdrawn from her profiting lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘heavy’ when Willoughby was late on Tuesday during a difficult meeting in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not hold enough time for Truly, their home year mark and accessories by her new contracts (with a value of about half a million pounds).
The company is actually compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and expected Willoughby's fortune to double 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacations abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure her future for a long time, and provide enough for the next decade.
Everyone was bluffed when they decided to move back.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday because the launch was planned for a short time.
The main establishment store in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the absence of the representative, one of the most profitable stars of Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of large investments in products of costumes and cards to clothing and home year, and because the launch could now take on further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two seats often go together on vacation and Jones has a share of 40 per cent in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon be a M&S brand ambassador and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin as the representative of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British ITV sender.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business affairs.’
Hard language 'and then was love between us'
He took note of the criticism he would receive in the media about a comment he made that some people would find 'not fit for a president' and his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump invented a novelist when he said:
'I didn't say anything.'
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been concluded.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, U.S. Supreme Diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see ‘conformity’ in the United States after the first disarmament initiatives in North Korea.
The United States is going under his sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
'We do it very well in North Korea,' he said.
“We stood close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.'
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results, the rocket tests were completed, the hostages were released and the material surpluses of American soldiers were returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to treat you as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to these dark arenas, there would be about 200 people here," said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island where hundreds of deaths occurred
For example, in the village of the village of Lombok, foreigners had to hear that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no more housing, there was no national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid.
'In many cases it is very clear that they do not ask for international help, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs. Summing.
Save the Children is involved in the formation of a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the help providers from abroad can work elsewhere.
Mr Sutopo, head of the national disaster relief agency, said that Indonesian officials were still considering the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia continues to suffer from earthquakes, the country is still particularly badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, we were built to work at Tsunamis, but along other coasts you can see these only rare.
That there was no warning series for tsunamis in Palu, although there was a strong warning, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
It can also be difficult in ideal circumstances to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National attacks make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship approved in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of the well-being infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But the government of President Joko has to fight a lack of funding, and that he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure by continuing sectoral efforts in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are currently following a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the street, with masks, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides an impressive matchmaker against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge held Liverpool last Saturday for losses against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a battle in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the moment he stood with 1-0.
He pointed left against the ball and then shot in the direction of the front ball.
The ball flew high above the penal area, in the direction of the right corner of the net.
He's been studying the origin of Kepa Arrizabalaga and a lot of it.
"It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible ahead," Sturridge said against LiverpoolFC.com.
'I saw Kante approaching, and I tried. I didn't really think about it, I just shot at the ball.'
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0 for, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Spit of The Blues shot the ball with its tail to Matthew Kovacic, and then he rushed through the middle field to Liverpool's game.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet in the middle of the field.
After that, he gave a fine catch, so Hazard could reach the capital area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and shot the ball with his left foot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back deck.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday about 15 hours in the team phase of the Championships League against Naples, in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes the Thursday for 15 hours in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
Suspension of tsunamis in Indonesia runs to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has occurred to 832, said the relief agency at national attacks on Sunday mornings.
Many people stood in the corner of buildings that were set up as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of the previous Friday, with waves rising 6 m high, said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after a woman was killed
This morning the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, where a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed signs of violence. A 32-year-old man was arrested on a memorial of murder.
The police ask the local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just begun, but I want everyone who is in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspiciously ask to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact if they can have anything filmed through a Dashcam. They can always have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon came friends who thought they knew the woman instead of asking questions about where they were found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are currently bringing the victim's family up.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to attend his apartment, but he got the police to hear that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents will now hear that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman seems crying in place.
They're still saying, 'What a terrible thing!'.
At 14 hours, two police cars stood in the station and one third stood outside.
In the appointment, a number of agents held the apartment building in the streets.
For information, please send a message to @MerPolCC, call to 101 or contact Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111, with log 247 of 30 September.
Photo by Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' series
The binding of the statue would be a poignant justice for the Taliban destruction of the many cultural and religious works of art carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as 'dwaas' and 'one attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the fishing of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconclassification of the English citizen accounts was still approved, or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion of the ruler in the 19th century and is part of the story of a figure that is still to be recognized by many.
Mr Goldsmith said against The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defence of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely correct idea, it is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognized figure representing one side of that cloud.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be recognized and remembered.'
Murderous pigs killed Chinese farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the southeastern China, according to reports in the local media.
The man from whom only the alien name ‘Yuan’ was known was killed on a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His killer was overboard and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A herd of pigs prepares for the nest of pigs at a farm on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have spent the day with his nephew from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 cows on the market.
The next morning, his neighbor found him dead, and a door was opened to a neighboring village.
According to the needle, there is a large male pig with blood on its back in the pigeon.
A federal investigation showed that the 250 kg crop had been killed, so the report.
'My nose's legs were bleeding and reduced,' said the nose with the nickname 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras it is seen that Yuan came to the market at 4.40 a.m. to carry his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed wasn't Yuan or his neighbor.
A market official told the Evening News that the church was closed to prevent other attacks while the police collected evidence in place.
As a result, Yuan's family and market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It's just rare, but there have been cases of insects that attack people before.
In 2016 a widow and her husband were killed on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 300-kg pig came out of Wales against his tractor until his wife left the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was arrested in 2012 by his pigs, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News found that dogs normally were not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression could disappear.
'They're just games.
It's just children, very curious... they're not ready to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount," he said.
The statue of the Orcaan Rosa brings heavy rain to the south-west of the U.S.
As foretold, Orcaan Rosa from now on has reached the cool waters of the north coast of Mexico.
The next days, however, Rosa will bring eternal kings to the north of Mexico and the south.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was on Sunday morning at 5 hours a local time of category 1, and is located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's going to wake up to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it begins to form a bridge above the Pacific, which moves east towards the coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the coast of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed north towards the south-west of the U.S.
Rosa will bring rain ten centimetres a month to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical rain will cause the coming storm to cause widespread severe rainfall in the south-west.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm will cause dangerous storms, rainstorms and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical weight will lead to a minimum of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that 5 to 10 cm of rain will be in parts of the south-west, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly worsening conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very wide.
It is strongly advised to walk into the desert when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn rainwaters into desert rivers, and winds and dust will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching train is bringing heavy rains to parts of the South California coast.
There is a range of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small pumps and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain fall of the region in the rain season.
Widespread tropical kingdoms will approach Arizona Sunday morning morning, after which the rains will be extended by the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and will continue to fall with the winter.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can be strong because the North Pole is cooler, but the troops remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to great differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the ongoing summer will try to build up and re-examine.
In a large part of the middle and east of the U.S., it would start to warm in October, with temperatures falling around 30°C, from the southern surfaces to the northeastern parts.
In New York the Tuesday can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
From our long-term weather forecast, it appears that the possibility of mid-October is high at higher average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people were looking at one of the six television networks on Thursday to the incoming witness of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a conspiracy that had lasted for years.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, while the regular program was interrupted by the surprise of the day: an agreement by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, was scheduled to investigate the complaint for a week.
Ford told the Senate Commission for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had beaten her and tried to remove her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a significant witness that he was 100% sure that this wasn't happening.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a lot of trouble with the numbers of people looking at an office.
For comparison: that is about a playoff of a football game or the Oscar race.
Fox News Channel, which gave Kavanaugh all the support, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million observers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2,52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, the audience was also very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the authorised Republic made a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on the morning of the day that the complainants were shouting at him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing by the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with low-sighted eyes while being replaced, alive on CNN.
'I'm standing here for you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone called: "You have power, while so many women are without power."
Flake said his office had made a statement, and a level for the elevator locked, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various envoys sent all alive when the judicial committee had to vote about the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate hours later.
But Flake said that he would agree with your understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the genome against the next week, something that the Democrats of the minority would change.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
The choice was important because it was clear that the Republics would not have the necessary votes to choose Kavanaugh well without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation to charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames criticism of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Premier Theresa May politician, who criticized her plans to leave the European Union a 'political game' with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit, and he said that her proposal that Britain and the EU had to engage together was 'absund'.
Schietpartij Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, is arrested and is in prison for the death penalty, said the police of Baton Rouge.
The authorities brought a video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the war.
The police found the brightness on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on the bridge, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later explained that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His town is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The congregation's similar shopkeeper in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday that states that the cause of death is a shock in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police, the Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to arrest.
Sport director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his 'introducing and pursuing justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per battle last season.
On Friday morning, LSU-basket balcoach Will Wade said that the team 'kapot' and 'in shock' were killed by Waydes.
"It's an event you always hope will never happen," says Wade.
Vulcan is said to be in Mexico City
The ass excavated by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern corners of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater was suspended and 183 gas emissions and were recorded for a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several times around and trilling.
On social media, photos of a thin layer appear on highways in Mexican cities, such as Xochimilco.
Geofysci has seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the shore of the Richter Central Mexico struck.
The volcano called ‘Don Goyo’ has been active since 1994.
Police clasht with Catalan separatists on the evening of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence activists were injured with the groundbreaking police, while thousands of participants took part in revaliding demonstrations on the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia which broke the region into two groups.
A group of pro-separatists who were opposed by the opposition police bothered the agents with eggs and powder, causing dark matter to emerge in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, the police broke out the screens, and the agents pulled their buttons up to keep the fighting going.
For more than an hour, pro-independency groups sang: 'Don't forget, don't forgive', while their opponents shouted 'Long live Spain'.
Forty people were treated for light injuries they experienced during the protests reported the local press.
The efforts remain high in the independent-based region, one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but are rejected by separatist Catalans.
The electors speak too much to be independent, even though the rise was low and the people who are opposed to the vote are boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the stadiums in the region, resulting in violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had spent the night on Saturday at a local camp to prevent demonstration to support national police.
The demonstration went through, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who, together with his wife, joined the separatist protest, said that he was no longer optimistic about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“Last year we met one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry out for joy because they could vote, but now we're fixed," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independency parties received a significant victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was not, this year it was difficult for them to continue to build on their success. Many of their most famous leaders are dissidents, either in self-reliance or in prison, in expectation of their role in organizing the referendum and expressing independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old Montenegrin who tweeted the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was resolved by politicians on both sides.
'The tension continues to rise,' he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in the interim since the end of last year, announced that he will take part in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the progress of the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonerry: men arrested after being beaten with a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car repeatedly broke into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday about 19.30 a.m. local time for Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building itself had been damaged.
It is possible that at a given moment, a crossboard on the car was also valued.
Livingston won with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston concerned them with winning
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 wars since he was the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's arrow came to be equal to Hibernian.
Gerrards didn't win this season to win a victory during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive Thursday in Europe League.
Livingston remains unscathed. The plague is now six wars after each other in his department, and coach Holt hasn't replaced any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against strong visitors
Holt's jump was long for the first goal to be achieved, and her direct way of playing was concerned about all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he didn't succeed in making it out with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who won Craig Halkett's head, shot the ball above the target.
The housework allows the Rangers to play with a lot of pleasure, and wait for his chances to be quiet and secure.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers left a free trail and Livingston took care of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who had been escorted from the penal area.
At that time the Rangers had been in exile for a long time, but the defense of the home was inevitable and the target man Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had a goal.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the legs of Rangersman Allan McGregor and Lithgow lost the goal after a show by his colleagues in Livingstone.
In the meantime, the capital of Livingston was threatened, but they were beaten every time. Twice a criminal was refused, one after Halkets attacked invasive Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's 'Fenomenal' - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played with no exception, and the expectations continued to overcome in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their fleet has been almost altered since they returned to the highest regions, but Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He was so crazy.
The leader Halket was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were on the tops of their tennis.
But the Rangers didn't know by breaking up.
Even though they played very well under Gerarrd this time, they didn't reach their usual level.
Their final phase wasn't good enough (they just hit it once to split the house) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better. They're still somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Keulen
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met together on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They are not even on issues such as human rights, privacy and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan leaves to Keulen for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Keulen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police appeared for safety reasons when they called on the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathetic people came near to see their president.
And hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurdens, let them hear their voice, and they condemned both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The revalidating protests reflect the division of a visitor who is viewed by some German Turks as a hero and others who are accused of autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The trainer dies after a car crash
In London a biker came around at a bus stop.
The accident occurred near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 p.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died somewhere.
A few months ago, another passenger died in an accident with a refugee traffic on the Children's Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said agents were involved in identifying the man and his family.
The road is closed in different places, buses are turned around and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six cypsies lost in order tours
Six Cypriots have been wounded in an order revolution in a hard-safe prison for men, according to the prison office.
The deceased spend about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Larsin in Worcestershire and are still on the move.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ chips are designed to solve a situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The Cypriots were treated locally for light disturbances in the face.
A spokesman from the Prison Service said: ‘It is specially trained in prison personnel for an actual incident in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and in any case the responsible are referred to the police and may have to remain behind the trace.'
In HMP Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners remain, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison director was reported to have been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the opposition police were called into prison for a serious criminal offence involving billiards.
Orkaan Rosa fears Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression will reach Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen next week, because the remaining energy of Orcaan Rosa moves about the south-west of the desert area, which brings risks to overrun itself.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already provided warnings of sudden storms to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's going to wait for the Tuesday floor above Phoenix, and it's gonna rain tonight.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘in 1950 only ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of Phoenix 200 miles!
Katrina (1967) was an Orcaan within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The most recent models of the National Hurcane Center represent a range of 5 to 10 centimetres, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rome of Arizona.
Other parts of the south-east of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Becken, are likely to get rain 3 to 5 cm, and here and there are 10 cm possible.
For areas where there is no risk of overruns, the rivers of Rosa can be a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of these rainfalls will probably be beneficial, because the southwestern is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are identified makes more than 40 per cent of Arizona at least extreme drought by, on one of the highest categories, reporting weather.com.
The track of Orcaan Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California ski resort in Mexico.
Rosa is still on the east coast with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm strikes cold waters in the Pacific, causing them to weaken.
It is therefore expected that she will arrive in Mexico on Monday or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
High levels of rain can fall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of floods.
‘Average of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the north west of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border with Arizona in the early eight days as a tropical depression, which later leaves her in the afternoon by Arizona and will be given in the south of Utah.
"The greatest danger that Rosa or her husband is expected to face is very severe rainfall in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora, and the south-west of the desert area," said the National Hurcane Center.
These rivers will be expected to lead to life-threatening eruptions and rainstorms in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests in memory of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for trying to kill after a 16-year-old man was found in Somerset.
On Saturday about 4 hours of local time, the teenager was caught in the Excelsior Terrace village in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, so the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who has filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh's 'elevated among the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the incorrigible and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,' said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his nomination procedure, Kavanaugh continued to 'heap among the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday for the Congress and was deeply and emotionally alarmed by Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually active decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing of her warning.
On Saturday, the President said that the 'American people 'is 'the strange and incredible character, the quality and courage' of Kavanaugh saw that day.
"A vote to recognise Judge Kavanaugh, is a vote with one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service," he told the numerous supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican arrival in the medium-term elections.
‘For five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives is to take place.
I don't take part, but I do,' he said.
'That's why I'm coming everywhere for great candidates.'
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'supply and stop us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place on a very free day, a top-person of the GOP led by CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesian earthquakes, tsunamis, and the tower continues to rise
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were taken from the ground when giant waves fell down on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of really six meters high above land at the time it started to slam. Many people broke up and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They didn't walk along the way and became the victim of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the Indonesian office for help with natural BNPB attacks during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he drove cars, trees, houses, he hit everything on the ground,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coast.
Some people fall into a tree to escape from the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On air photos released by the relief agency at natural disasters it is seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was surrounded by snowballs.
The number of earthquakes has been felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy free from the massive earthquake of liberty was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, small bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘asthic’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were located.
Some fatal casualties were determined under the bridge of insulated buildings, he said. So 540 people were wounded and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, in a area called Donghea, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donghea is ‘completely flat, we have no information’, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live," said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
'It's already a tragedy, but it can become even worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organisation received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although workers said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur pictures shared on social media, it is to hear how a man shouts to people on the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
A few minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and is built and furnished with cars.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive flow of communications around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending freight aircraft with help supplies from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is only open to aid and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami dodendol increases above 800.
It's very bad.
True, the workers of World Vision from Donghea have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers at their office's office are looking for subdak in tents of dexel, but passing through the streets of destruction, Doseba said.
'They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed,' he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of bringing relief, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great skill.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can be granted only if the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
'It is still a disaster at provincial level,' said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'Since the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has not always been excluded.'
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, many on Palu, friends and family of the missing hope were back to their loved ones, such as in the miracles that people like to hear in terrible natural disasters like these.
Saturday, a young man was taken out of a rival.
On Sunday, volunteers released a woman who had been in the hole for two days with the look of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subannon, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had previously been located in Indonesia this month.
His students were also established in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mangyi.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I bring my own emotional burden," he said.
Dr. Gendon told us that the Roa Roa Roa Hotel had been set up in the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter, he had sent unexpected reports of WhatsApp to the sportsmen in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one gray angle appears instead of two blue angles.
'I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,' he said.
Dieven steals $26,750 while saving cash in Newport on the Live
On Friday morning, $26,750 was stolen from a worker from Brink who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Live, according to a press report from Newport police.
The driver had just put a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man from behind Brink's staff took a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects, so the press report, but the police did not tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Those who have information on the identity of the dads are requested to contact the Newport police on numbers 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name in Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change to Twitter with the words: ‘It is known formally as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been named Ye for a short time and used this name as title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change of names was announced in the course of his work on Saturday Night Live, where he will propose his new album Yandhi as expected.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the show’s author.
You are not just a short summary of his current artist name. First, West told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
According to me, ‘ye’ is the most important word in the Bible, and in the Bible means ‘you’,’ said West earlier this year, when he told radio representative Big Boy about the title of his album.
‘If I'm you, I'm us, we're it.
I'm replaced by Kanye, which means 'the only', to simply you, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the crazy, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, also worked with and without the link and the capital letters.
The President of Mexico does not promise to use force against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the front of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza that he would ‘never use military violence to oppress the Mexican people’.
On October 2, 1968, military troops burned on the ground at a peaceful stake, where 300 people were killed. During the period, left students moved throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and open more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artistic intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says the investor and A.I.-specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this because of the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be at the level of A.I. innovations.
'The budget for research to A.I. would already be a good start, since all other countries are so behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next break in A.I.' said Lee.
A duplication of funding may lead to a duplication of the possibility of the next major implementation of A.I. in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synoving Ventures, who invested in Face+, one of China's major A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that the best player of American Othello promised, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee spoke out of appreciation for technological warfare organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and early on when the next war would take place, because it would help to discover the next viewers.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
'China doesn't look at our best academics, the companies do that,' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years offered the best powers of universities to work at A.I..
Lee said that the American efforts at the A.I. level would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
'Who's doctorate at the A.I. level should automatically get a green card,' he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the following generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences grants financial support to academic staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre designed to involve industry and academic partners in the initiative, and announced the White House the formation of the Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Limitting Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million in research to A.I.
However, the American legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been in operation for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change in their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in the ‘North Republic of Macedonia’, which would end up with Greece which had been set up for decades and would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also known as Macedonia, and it says that the name of its northern neighbour includes the country's accession to the Greek territory.
The two governments concluded in June an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change in name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he did not vote in the referendum, and by means of a boycottcampaign it is not sure that the required arrival will be reduced by 50 per cent, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the vote was expressed as follows: ‘Are you a representative of the NATO and the EU, with the approval of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Representatives of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worth trying to be a member of institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"I am today voting for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome by which they are determined.
The change in names would require a second dimension in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 13 hours.
However, the rise was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
'I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an elector in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Struca, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of names of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small podium in front of the Parliament in Skopje and placed it in front of tents placed by the people who were the referendum boycottin.
"We are the advocates of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a post-port, Kavadarkov said.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.'
Premier Zaev says that NATO's membership will provide food aid to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is prosperous, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are EU-NAVO' Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Guidance Research showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another petition, carried out by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
That would be 70 per cent and a vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, it must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-West Government's policy since it came into force in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero van Manchester City is in full defense of Brighton and short
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made briefs with the defense of Brighton in the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the battle with 2-0.
It looked like a flight of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian spy first got the ball played on the middle floor.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defense and was too fast for some others at the border of the Brighton criminal area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his court case to punish the target man Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has been carrying problems with his feet,’ said the coach Pep Guardian of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he'd cut a ball at that moment.'
But it was Sterling that Sky Blues gave the first advantage in the Premier League.
That's what happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball at the same time and then sent Sterling to the second floor.
The Sky Blues player just pointed the ball in, level for him too far.
The city takes the Tuesday at 12.55 a.m. against Hoffenheim in the Campions League group phase. The competition takes place in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
The slider wants to play and does not make the Rockies easy to reach the playoff
Now the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was little reason to force a new start.
However, the competitive Scherzer always hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently one battle for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least a wild card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 winning against the Nationals on Friday, but now they want to put everything in place to ensure their first title.
‘Although there is nothing more for us, at least we can point to the science that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this public and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in there?'
The Nationals still have to announce who will be present on Sunday, but they are inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitter in such a situation.
Scherserzer, who would start his 34th, stood on Thursday in the courtyard and would still pick up the next Sunday, although it is normal for his rest day.
The right-wing Washington translator is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inductions this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the High Court, while discussing the importance of the Republican arrival in the medium-term elections.
‘All we have already accomplished is on the game in November.
Five weeks is one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the really big choices, I don't share, but I actually do, so I come everywhere for great candidates,' he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it now.
And they are determined to take the power back into their hands, regardless of what they have to do for it.
It doesn't make them suffer, they have to be removed to gain power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'supply and stop us'.
'That's what we've seen in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'good, common and false and false'.
He named the name of the Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein, who is appointed in the Senate Commission for Justice, which led to a loud call from the public.
‘Do you know what they said?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body chair, the worst body chair I've ever seen.'
Labor is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the newest in a whole range of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My Parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because they had come up with a resolution against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motive for censorship because I wasn't with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues as these did not agree with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labor conference on Friday, ‘We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I have been a local member of the Labour Parliament.
Unfortunately, today it is not the show of many meetings and the promise of a 'more expensive, sweeter' policy has been forgotten long ago.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the party's guidance or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues who had before me a similar political look if I expected to turn around and take a position I would never have agreed with otherwise, from issues such as national security to the European Union market.
As far as I speak to a public, what I also say is that there are social media partners calling for my candidate to be a member of Parliament for the following elections, where the policy of the centre is to be taken up and I am told that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And that's just what I'm through.
In fact, I know that I am happier than some of my fellow Members, because the comments to my address on the general policy are general.
I am under the impression of the professionality and stability of those colleagues who have a lot of sexual or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this period of politics is that very sharp parties appear to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer those broad churches and with every ‘motion of mistrust’ or change of electoral rules, the party is becoming smaller.
For the past two years, I have often received advice to keep me quiet, not just to tell my opinion, and then I would 'not come into trouble'.
But that's not why I didn't go to politics.
Since I became a member of the Labour school 32 years ago, provoked by the failure of the Government of Thatcher, which caused my classroom to literally collapse, I have always performed better public services for those they need most, both in my role as a congregation council member and in my role as a minister.
I've never kept my politics hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had a clear understanding of my policy points and my two points with the current leadership.
I can only say one thing to those who have proposed the motion for a free day: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will damage families, companies and our public services, I do not understand the need to play time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually, I have only one message, which is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are now members of Labor or not: I am proud of you and I promise that threats to my candidate as a member of Parliament for the following elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Year 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsacrifice Air on the way to the top
Two late three's may have drawn the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr rightly triumphs in this glorious battle of the day in the Tenent's Premiership.
They're now upstairs in the classroom, the only innocent team of the ten.
Finally, it was their superior defense as well as their better chances that the house was going to win, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
'We've been having a hard time in our fight, and we're still failing, so I'm a happy man,' he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: 'All honor to Ayr, they have their chances better than we.'
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, commissioned by Frazier Climo, led to a premier for Ayr, but through a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Cup (which he received during the Warriors War) Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot was able to break a trial.
Climo provided a penance for an extra source for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. So the 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose began the second half good and Patrick Anderson's trial, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the origin to five points.
The battle lasted a long time for a serious blessing from Ruardh Knott, who was executed on a brand, and as soon as the battle started again, Ayr could continue to run through a trial of Stafford McDowell by a conversion of Climo.
At that time, the carrier Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and once again Melrose withdrew with the extra man when no conversion followed a trick of Bruce Colvine at the end of a battle where the pressure was very high.
The housekeeper, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received an empty card because he took Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the impressive Ayr-maul for a touchdown on the penalty-line out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe took the box of David Armstrong's boot and half back Gregor Henry left for the fifth trip of the house.
Stair van Still Game is ready for new careers in the restaurant world
It appears that Actor Ford Kieran is going from Still Game in the Horeca. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series that he writes and where he acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already at stake.
According to official data, he is the director of Adymorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun lets go through that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'bloating restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the Bolivian border hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific.
Seeui patrols in an annual dress office in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag is fired.
On all the seabeds of the Titicacameer to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back.'
In all the country around Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that the country has to stand in place after a bloody nine-hundred-and-a-half-year-old conflict of raw materials in Chile is still alive, just as it needs to be preserved in the Pacific.
This hope may well have reached its highest point in the last decade, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court hearing, which should be held on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the Court's statement on large screens, hoping that the Court of Justice in De Haag, in the interests of Bolivia, will assume that Chile, after decades of poor talks, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is next year in the wake of a controversial re-election struggle, is very much at stake with the speech of Monday.
'We are very close to the return to the Pacific,' he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for Bolivia, and even if it were, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands did not have the authority to recognise the Chilean territory and indicated that it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The statement by the International Court of Justice only six months after the closure indicates that the case was 'not complicated', says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the other hand, in the past four years, perhaps the situation has even become worse.
"The case about access to the sea has been taken by the current Bolivian government," Zárate said.
The war-stricken retort of Morales has all the good wishes that Chile may still have had in mind, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk with them at some point, but it will be especially difficult to speak further.
The two countries have no ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia in the Hague, regrets that the decision of the court has been taken very quickly.
Today, Bolivia will ‘have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘end at 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual advantages’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political tool.
‘Bolivia will never grant its right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The statement is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is possible only if the US can trust
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust him.
Today, Ri speaks at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to follow the commitments made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that state Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to start the recent nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is an 'utopia' that the continued sanctions and the American charge against a declaration that the Korean war is ending will never be taken by North Korea.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without first taking major steps on the level of disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is rather scepticism, and there is no doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would turn away from an arsenic that the country is likely to see as his own way of guaranteeing his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris discovers the latest collection of huge headlines, soon to buy you in the neighborhood
If you want to expand your bird collection or you want to keep the sun completely out of your eyes, then do not seek further.
Innovators Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a series of yellow cross-sections for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpracticable shepherds were not to think of Instagram, and these designers have sent their eyebrowing creatures to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant bead decorated with a four-fold wide edge that grips over the eyes of the models.
Other overcrowded accessories were watermelons equipped with precious stones, a tovenar hat and even ananas, but not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also noticed a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were very close. They look more like Hannibal Lecter than they do on skin texture.
One creature looked like a doll, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a broken ice.
And if you want to follow this corrupt fashion, you're lucky.
Stywachters predict that the huge guards will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant birds may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the streams carry a two-metre wide range that all carry from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The cult label behind the very inactivative wood that was all over the social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a streamy beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathpack that the bag contained.
The red-ring raffia bag, cut off with raffia francs and made up with a white lead ring, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.

John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has again resulted in a number of excellent exams, and in addition, individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community in 2018.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, which they have chosen and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular and desired in excellent schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you speak to someone in a language he understands, then you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.'
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's examinations, we can learn that languages are on the top list, with the highest percentages in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages studied a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools in SCIS show that 72% of students received a high score ('A') in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Languages are now valued as professional also as STEM-subjectes (scientific science, technology, technology and science) in independent school programmes and others.
A study by the British Commission for Jobs and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the blockades to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills thus become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
Now more and more vacancies require linguistic knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite the career of choosing someone, if he has learned a second language, he has in the future a real advantage with such skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multiple person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent was unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. France was the only language that exceeded 10 per cent, with a total of 15 per cent.
This is why investment in language education is now important for children today.
More languages, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they learn.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Such independent schools are set up to provide an army that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to win, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at the moment that languages remain vitally important in a global business environment for the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James's first battle at the Los Angeles Lakes, waiting is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening battle on Sunday before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It must be determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers scheme for the six-war season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any fights before the season to prepare for me," he said.
Period of election rallys from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of elections
It is the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the coming week, including in places taken by him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now, the vote on the appointment of the candidate for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is expected to be supported by Trump for the forthcoming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress in November.
How often does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have the hearings for candidate-right Brett Kavanaugh this week. They were extra loaded with Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and the Senate may be waiting for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main aim of this series is to help the republics that are candidates for elections in November to get more elena.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallys were meant in the following week to ‘improve volunteers and supporters, while the republics are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Deputies’, so Reuters.
'Control over the Congress is as important to its programme that the President will travel to as many states as possible to start the busy campaign season,' said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be mentioned on behalf of Reuters.
The rally tonight in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh media, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump visited Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the elections.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a ride in the races," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the race to Sunday's singles
After three separate sessions, the breakfasts of Saturday may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The slammer of opportunities is a fully-founded sport concept, but it is a real player in faith, especially in competitions like these.
So who's gonna get the best chance right now?
'They had first one origin of six points, and now it is that only four more, so we find such a little thing that happiness is on our side,' Jordan Spieth said to him at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being four points, while there are still twelve points in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each three points of the four scored.
Spieth is one of the most feared opponents of tea to green and he sets the good example.
The typical throat sounds that he made when he played well, became louder with his round forwards and he performed a crucial puzzle with which the battle was four success when he and Thomas stood two points behind two fights.
His poem with which she won the war on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind that you can learn from him that he believes the American team has not been reported yet.
'You have to dig deep and take care only of your own game' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unforgettable story of the Ryder Cup.
This is remarkable, but beautiful European customs have four to four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Molywood’ was the only duo that Saturday morning played no bogey, but also on Saturday morning, Friday morning and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their Romanian audience, they are the players who should be reported on Sunday.
In the case of two different holes, it is preferable.
However, it is too late to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short talks with Sergio Garcia, the football hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front led to a background for the Spaniard and the Swedish that they no longer came up.
Today, however, there is no one who can help you get your back.
The four-balls and four-somes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change in a vision.
So far, the European team has played the best and has a good lead in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the United States team is ready to go to war, something that some, especially in the U.S., have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a good start on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-days of Saturday they stand in 10-6 for the United States.
The so-called Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which made it difficult for them to get four points from Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Björn, which wanted to lose them in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the shining Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the Foursomes, where the two wars were fought, but his background could no longer be found.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 single-wars of Sunday in order to keep the trophies alive.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points, while he and Molinari, who received the so-called ‘Molliwood’ after a sensitive week, are the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that four points win in their four opening wars.
After they had built Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played on each other, and they accused them of a devastating Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 57-4.
Woods, who himself fought for two competitions on Saturday, looked down and saw a striking star, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-somes and seven on row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together hired Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the worlds, with 2&1.
However, it does not take a false look at Europe on this acceptable day with a bridge in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has already lived three times, and Justin Thomas put the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won a difficult battle with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the Foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It was only twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team could have a back-up of four points at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk's team has enough to match, since they currently have the trophies in their hands.
But now they've been in second place for two days, it seems like an attack on Sunday is too high.
North Korea says it's going to be 'no case' alone without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would continue to build confidence in the United States and that the country would not be able to stand alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Meeting that in the past year, North Korea has experienced "great goodwill measures" such as the halting of nuclear and rocket tests, the decommissioning of the location for nuclear tests and the promise of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
'We see no consistent response from the US,' he said.
'Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unarm each other in any case.'
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's threat to a 'failed' approach to nuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded with further steps, it is very much aware that he did not withdraw unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the 'denucuration of the Korean Republic', while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should put his nuclear weapons out first.
Washington has also opposed its appeal to suppressing the strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges 'denuclarization first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a powerful way and even by questioning the 'declaration of the End of War'," Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only strengthen our confidence.'
Ri did not report any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader had already opened in the United Nations week.
The Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party was in this issue of South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclearization of the Korean Republic would not have been such an impact.’
However, Ri's speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the U.S. mainland were directed after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump Kim called a ‘racetman’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, promised this year to the United Nations to take his courage to take steps to eliminate it, but said that there must be a lot to do and that the sanctions must continue to denuclearize North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no schedule for this: ‘If it's two years, three or five months, that doesn't work.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council in Pyongyang must pay for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue strong and firm until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearization'.
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unilateral sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo, outside the UN General Assembly, had a meeting with Ri and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit is not well.
About a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that there was progress, North Korea referred to him as setting 'principal requirements'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to unveil a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘coherent measures’.
He said Kim had told him that the ‘coherent measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that the Trump had given in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow the course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which the cool seems to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of the world's largest university often have no idea of basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a leading sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School, a specialist linked to the Brigham and Women's Hospital, established the course. For how he knows this is unique in the U.S.
He got the idea to start with the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep failure on learning.
'At the end of my talk, a girl came to me and said, 'Why do I get to hear this now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he said against The Telegraph.
In the course of this year for the first time, students will be given the basic principles of how good sleep habits help to improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a leading psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep disorder during the week.
The course takes one hour and involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a sleeping room where they click on coffee cups, vegetables, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performances are affected by sleep loss, and the importance of a routine when sleeping.
In another part, participants are given to hear how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Through a platform of the camp, with interactive pictograms, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
'We know that we will not change the students' behaviour immediately.
But we find that they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of choice for cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride on a night of students still exists, he says, and through modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep is a growing problem.
In order for adequate sleep, of good quality, the student's 'secret weapon' must be to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight loss, as sleep loss ensures that the brain gives them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to establish the course. He had always studied at the university every year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course was available for everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, and not only a alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics and light, which can trigger your circadian rhythm, making it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes the men of Gerarrd go down
The Rangers saw their exhilarating battle again, when Dolly Menga scored, and the weak foot of Steven Gerrard threatened with 1-0 in Livingstone.
The strike of Ibrox hoped for a first victory in a battle since they defeated St Johnstone with 4--1 in February, but Gary Holt's strike took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 battles. His strike now takes eight points behind Hearts, which further runs to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Many scored in seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers didn't succeed to score the same maker.
The Rangers now move to the sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third, with only a difference in number of dollars compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could still have more problems, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a main benefit after apparently being thrown to him by the visitor's supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes through his flight. They hit Ayr and go to half the finals of the Betfred Cup.
It remained at the same eleventh of Livingston, which the Hearts knew a point about last week. He would have been raised on the way in which his good attitude led to block the opponents at every set of times.
The Rangers may have had most of them, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga gave up the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder couldn't stop it.
A deep free trap from Keaghan Jacobs reached the leader Craig Halket, but his colleague-protected Alan Lithgow shot at the back.
The Rangers did succeed in taking over the control, but they looked rather like a good run than that they were really in the faith if they were able to reach the goal.
In any case, Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a trial when he and Steven Lawless were playing in a room, but judge Steven Thomson dismissed the request from the Colombians.
The Rangers could only shoot at the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was the former target at the Ibrox, could easily keep the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the stupid shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opening of Livingston in the 34th minute, however, must not sit in the length of the general game, no one can deny that they deserve this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not raised against Jacob's deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who took the ball with ease in the target.
Gerrard took care of a break with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent exchange. This set had almost immediate consequences when the plane player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly race from his line to keep the ball against.
But Livingston continued to pressure visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston loves, where Lithgow and Halkett have long played ball.
The Holt team had been able to increase its momentum in the final phase of the battle, but McGregor kept a good stand and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came out of the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a punishment at the end of the war for an arrest with Jacobs, but Thomson looked at the other side.
Germany: the discoverer of the Gegitterler
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom would TELLEN... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
More developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device with the name of the receiver.
Since then, it has not been far from science, and in the pop culture it has also become an icon, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the first-ever obvious cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What is that in the name of God?'
Rogers: ‘It’s a gynecologist. It is used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ harmful cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ and kill harmful cells
Vaccin teaches immune system to detect harmful cells during treatment
The method includes the extraction of immunosuppressants in a patient to change them in a lab.
They can then see a white ‘see’ that often occurs in many types of cancer and then re-injected
A testvaccin provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect harmful cells saw her iron toxin disappear for more than 18 months.
The method removes the immune system from a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted, so that they can “see” the HER2 egg, which often occurs in all types of cancer, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "From our results it seems that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancers’, including breast cancer, iron cancer, long cancer and darm cancer, Professor Berzofsky said.
A similar way to remove immunosuppressants from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to pack cancer cells was previously used in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West connects pro-Trup time and carries MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That's not as he hoped.
Kanye West was excited during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inconsistencies in which he praised American President Donald Trump and said he would become president's candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third night number, Ghost Town, with his head a pet with the text Make America Great Again, he broke a tyrant against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘Look, when I speak to a white person, he asks, ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!’
When I was worried about racism, I had been away from America for a long time, he said.
The mission of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood's sister Matt Damon took the lead with the witness of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Commission for Justice in connection with the mixed charge that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The thirade of West was not sent out, but camet Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock and his post want to stick with West.
West also complained against the public that he was taken back by fire to his pet.
‘They have chased me backstage.
They said, "Don't stand on the podium with that pet."
They've fired me!
And then they say I'm apathic, he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how pathetic it looks?’ He said that he would attract them superman-cape, ‘but that means you can't order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love.'
From the audience, at least two times a book call came and the SNL Castel members looked down, according to Variety. The magazine received an audience to hear: ‘The whole study was quite quiet.’
West was to host as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with an execution of the number I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said twice: ‘On one of our braveest dreams: BEDANKT OF THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talkshow-presenter Karen Hunter doubts that the West was just ‘normally self, and that's beautiful.’
‘But I chose to reward someone who supports and exposes an ideology that damages my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
So did we. She added.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘it has been officially known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague-rapper Snoop Dogg also has the name Snoop Lion and the last musical Prince has ever changed his name in a symbol and then in The artist formally known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by party in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, the police said.
The accused will appear to be expected tomorrow for the police officer in Belfast.
The complaint will be examined by the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Game of Thrones sister Kit Harington comes from toxic humanity
Kit Harington is known for his role as hard-core Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor comes from the stereotype of the machoheld and says that young boys often think they should be tough to get respect when they see such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he finds that ‘the thing is wrong’ and asked himself how to deal with the problem of toxicity during #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, gave him strong conviction that the problem must be addressed.
'This is a really important question for me personally at the moment: where is the failure of our masculinity?' he said.
'What have we learned men when they grew up, and why are we now faced with this problem?'
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxicity, by his very male characters.
He said, “What is born, and what is born?”
What is happening on TV and on the street that makes young people think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the major questions of today: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men.'
In the interview, he also said that he would not act in prequels or sequences of Games or Thrones if the series was over the next summer, because he is ‘clear with shooting fields and horses’.
Since November, Kit plays with him in a Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is overvalerable.
The actor recently discovered that he finds that his meeting with his wife, Rose, is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
'I've met my wife during the series, so this is how I've kept my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygrintte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The team was married in June 2018 to the village of Leslies family in Scotland.
Hiv/aids: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been hit by it in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed through sex, which was not so before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who have thus passed through nearly zero said Chinese health experts at a conference in Yunnan province.
In comparison with the same period last year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people in China.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been criminal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has become widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying a woman.
The disease is often transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV-medicine in the context of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff worker has collected data from Republican senators and is derived from ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘complete theories’
The American Congress of Maxine Waters is against the charges that one of its staff has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claims that the charges are spread by “extremely” tweets and websites.
'Legens, lies and even more fake lies' said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private and private phone number of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appears online on Thursday. They were posted by a stranger at Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the charges of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate director of the Supreme Court.
The case came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicated the source of the mail was linked to the Waters office and contained information from a Waters staff, said the Hill.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a flashing lie," said Waters.
‘My colleague, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false charges, was not responsible for reading this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a fragrant lie.'
Waters' statement has already stopped running on criticism online, including by former persmedist of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds good,' wrote Fleskir.
“From here you can tell that she doesn’t have the temperature to be Congresslid.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He doesn't have to get up.
He should not question the motives of the complainant.
He must remain calm and serene.'
Fish appear to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on the right Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive evil during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the medium-term elections, also commented on Twitter.
'Talk, if it's true,' he said second.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had brought up the relevant services and enforcement agencies with these false charges.
"We will ensure that the fathers are known," she said, "and that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff."
Review: Johnny English Strings Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In each new film with a British inscription, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and it seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comedy action films with a sleepy spy in the capital, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was reconvened with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is this airy self-sustainment about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with revealing eyes and flexible faces, in any case, succeeds in sending everything in the hundredth, even with his second comeback. You can already hear that he is a general comic character that has been considered for bioscopic passengers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
Of course he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his extraordinary appeal to smooth glass, a little Clouseau, a flying Mr. Bean, and a reputation of that man who has one need to contribute to the Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He was originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson who had ever played in Barclaycard's TVpots (for whom everyone was forgotten) who always left behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it beautiful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armory and the rotor leaves even against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this film how many talents he has for physical comedy, but the humor is too weak and not too much, especially now the "strong" series of films like 007 and Mission Impossible itself as ingredients, and it does well.
Rather, the humor seems to be meant for children than for adults, and Johnny English's deep disaster rate comes to me less original and focused on the jokes without the text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is going through great difficulties.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret spy network on the web, making it known the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain, to the great resignation of the agent in function, a rather small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the duplicity that the prime minister has to overcome, a pretentious woman with problems with her head and very unpopulated as a politician. Emma Thompson does her best with this very character that she thinks of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence adviser, she must insert a retired spy, as each active spy has been compromised.
And that means the exciting Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in a chique institution, but unofficially learns about sub-cooverwork. Here are some funny jokes in the story, because the spy readings of English that do at School or Rock think about.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for a subscription and reopened with its former famous help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, and his wife is the captain of a teacher, an unsatisfied and young role that is under Vicki Pepperdines level.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and Olga Kurylenko's bloody feminist Ophelia Bulletinova.
In the meantime, the first minister of the charismatic techno-semillaire's charms claim that he can solve the British computer problems: the sister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start at their odysseys of clumsy dolls ready: dressed as obsessed by a careful French restaurant in fire, they create a reign on board the luxury hunt of Volta and English cancels pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself trusted with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are drawn up, but as well as well as the unsatisfied, they do what they think of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I ask myself: can the British film sector now really not think of a role that affects the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is planning to work four days a week, but it will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan where Britain works four days a week, but it will be paid for five days.
As a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) the party would like to extend to its employees, based on companies, the savings they make as a result of their revolution, by giving them an extra day-to-day vacation.
This is how workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn a lot.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to make the country's balance is in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Vaccines, which is a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A top-ranking source from the Labor Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘There will be a policy review expected before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at the same time, but a four-day work week is a goal that is appropriate in the efforts of the party to make the balance in the economy more available for the benefit of the workers and that is also appropriate in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, since the Green Party has promised four-day work week in the 2017 country election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A speaker from the Labour Party said: "A quarter-day work week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from the 'visible drivers' and 'profits' in the business.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover the full value of their share, as a Labour Government could apply 'shorts' on the basis of a monitored move.
He also confirmed that there are plans to hire employees in business management councils and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Including Property Funds) with 10 per cent of the shares of firms from the private sector to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh can change their mind
The investigation by the FBI to charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has a definitive vote on its appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could ensure that the Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview to be sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley, the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI would be able to find out something that might lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, unambiguous."
But Graham's voice seems to stand still.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamism," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Bret has strongly rejected it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one named by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday is held in New York at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive lineup will take place and a very impressive mission is known: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come for the Global Citizen Festival to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Contestants who wanted a free card for the event (as long as they were willing to pay for a VIP card) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as doing volunteer work, conducting a world leader e-mail, telephoning, or in another significant way generate awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen Festival, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince them to ask for action or is it just another form of 'clipticism', people feel that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, which have been aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the involvement of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that should change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the Group cited 390 initiatives and statements on the basis of actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsorships.
The group estimates that the funds received thus far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The most important intentions of The Power of Nutrition are a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realize their full potential. This group has promised Rwanda $35 million to end training in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens as we can from the social injustice that is taught, make a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent to the British Government to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the numerous questions on the website of the Global Citizen, which was asked, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group replied, "It will be a long and difficult journey, where we will fall and fall.
But, just like citizens' rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will act this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can set up the sea for a 'blocked' to stop Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' take his flight to the sea to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, including in the Middle East, declared Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the request of the legal government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to operate in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to fight this.
"The United States has that opportunity, with the sea, to ensure that the rails remain open and, if necessary, to block them in order to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Green language for those who attended an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profiting themselves as the 'vote of energy consumption' in the U.S.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that they do not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less or more to use and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is trying to encourage the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia with a country offering the best option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to turn its attention back from the 'inadequate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum van Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prison'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pillar, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition of Washington to the project is only sent for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the belief that energy cannot be used to exercise pressure and that consumers must choose their suppliers themselves," said Alexander Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy Affairs after a meeting with Rick Perry, the American Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has raised a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI), the leading industry organisation in Germany, called on the US not to try to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third chance is struggling with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about 'to take part in the presidential elections in 2020' says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she was 'responsibly thinking' to take part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she thought about it to take part in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position" she said according to the political news sheet The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think about making me the president."
Warren ran out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in town hall and said he was "misleading the country".
"I'm still disappointed at the boat about what Donald Trump is bringing into our democracy," she said.
Warren was open-ended in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need to start an investigation by the FBI before we vote on it."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own accessions find that they should not be selective in 2020.
Twenty-five percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator did not have to be selective, according to a study of the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent would have made it possible for them to be selective.
The study showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent before a possible candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats involved with the possible participation of the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
He said he would formally make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSS during a selection of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, has spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence last Monday.
"With what my own son needs to remember, what he now brings back, I understand for other families who have experienced the consequences of PTSS and the surprises that some of our soldiers have returned," she told the audience that there was a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and become stronger, they come back and ask themselves if there is respect for what their co-military and pilots and all other soldiers have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, including a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Vasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eight states and the District of Colombia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. which prevents victims from fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have made a statement on Friday as a 'friend of the Court' to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who is involved in this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the case Grace vs. Sessions made by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not known.
She says that her partner "and her violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas for that.
The lawyers of the states that Grace supports describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of people are coming from applying for asylum in the U.S., as countries that are aware of major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has returned a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals since 2014, in which it was possible for immigrants without documents on the flight for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the prosecutor-general of Washington D.C., said on Friday that the new policy "has been rejecting state, federal and international legislation for decades".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such a restriction is contrary to that principle" is set out in the statement of the 'friend of the court'.
The lawyers continue to argue that the policy whereby immigrants are denied access to the U.S. is damaging the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'for the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, has no longer recommended asylum to victims of domestic and border-related violence in June judges.
"Asiel is available for those who have fled their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion" so Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asyel was never meant to solve all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to the world every day.
Vulnerable rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was even worse.
"It feels very relaxed," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while trying to trust her short baby in an evacuation center in the town of Palu.
"Every minute new ones come in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents came back to their destroyed houses and searched in their overnight possessions for valuable toys they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and hospitals have been overcrowded, unless they have been damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has crossed a broken back and shoulders, rest outside the hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the chance to get pregnant.
His eyes filled with tears as he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake hit the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the rest of a wall," Haris told a representative of the Associated Press and added this when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accused China of 'intimidate' with 'proaganda-advertents'
One week after an official Chinese news sheet posted an announcement of four pages in an American daily sheet, where the opposite benefits of trade between the US and China were presented, the US ambassador of the US in China was accused of using the US press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump referred last to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of joining the American Congress elections on 6 November, a complaint that is rejected by China.
Trumps accused Beijing of attempting to challenge the elections in the U.S., marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a scaling campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign authorities to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a scalable trade war, in which they have raised import prices.
China's compensation policies were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had met American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "redoubles the intimidation by advertising advertising ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of opinion and of a free press, a long-run tradition in America by placing a paid advertising in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will find strange voices at a church in the centre of Beijing, and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have about the moeizm economic tragedy, because the media is standing firmly under the shadow of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent news pages refused to publish his article," if he did not say what news sheet this was.
The Kavanaugh debacle surprised the Republican women's choice of themselves for the medium-term elections, warning analysts
Now many important republics around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the High Court, and defend him against various allegations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will experience a return, particularly among women, during the upcoming inter-time elections.
The emotions surrounding this topic have been enormously raised, and most Republics have already been informed that they want to vote.
"These things can't be brought back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered if the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to pursue a FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the bad voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they're not forgotten tomorrow and they're not forgotten in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, an Senior Advisor and Country Speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, a number of protestors "November comes out!" during their demonstration in half of the Senate, while the Republics that the Justice Commission has taken control of choose to choose the candidate of Kavanaugh well, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can continue to occur, especially among the two female voters abroad and among young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the president."
Even for the public witness of Ford, in which they further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the High Court, analysts suggested that there would be a return if the Republics would press the nomination.
"This has become a crazy trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but also about the way the Republics have acted and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of USA, a group that helps the Democrats to be elected, clearly on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided on the question of who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, where a small majority is on the side of the last one.
A new opinion survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents are sure or likely to believe the testimony of Ford and that 35 percent are sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the presentation of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford announced last week to the Senate's Justice Commission that Kavanaugh had taken her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the High Court has shown her to her during a party that they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The discoverer of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to upload Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the discoverer of the World Wide Web, begins a start that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology project, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee captured that 'earth management' was the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
The lists can be stored with contact persons, activities lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available by one browser and all at the same time.
What POD makes unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to any information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about not even introducing a complete transformation which puts all their business models on their heads at once."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (from Inrupt) is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new time for the web" added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and carrier of Victoria Cross from WO I
The only spiritual of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier is later named 100 years later in his place of birth.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglish and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a shooter, and therefore he never knew that he was part of the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was uncovered by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said that the 'brilliant symbolist' was that the stone was suddenly destroyed 100 years after the fact that his father was separated.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick mess and under heavy fire of field protection and machinery".
He later stormed through the fire line and led the line forward before he alone ran to a field guard and turned three members out of the deck.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German skirmisher on October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "some of which I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also placed another branch after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very hurt to be able to play a role in the paradise" and added that "the severity of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people."
Fans of MMA became all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch a follow-up Bellator 206 and you won't be able to see the most important moment.
On the appellant from San Jose, 13 wars were reported, including six in the main section, and this was sent all night to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, just at the moment that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their fight, observers in the United Kingdom were surprised by the senders turned over to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed because they had been awake all night especially for this battle.
One of them described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government's rules, after 6:00 a.m., no content can be shown which is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the child programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked to be sent.
"Pappa the pig," Yesss.
Scott Cooker, president of Bellator's company, said they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that observers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the war back, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the exchange, there were a lot of text messages coming back and believing me, they weren't all just friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen a second time.
We limited the shipments to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferieur' because of his sexual curiosity
The Olympic Cleaninger Tom Daley says he felt during his youth inference because of his sexual appetite, but this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-five-year-old said that he didn't realize he was 'not everyone like me' until he went to further education.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homophobic rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that ageing had contributed to his lower worth of winning during the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular representative of the long-term show has been free of disease for a few months.
Apparently a shift on Laverne's first program told Daley that he felt 'lower' than others when he was young because it was 'socially not acceptable to find both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really the facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was a 'eman' so he wouldn't hurt people if they finally came after him.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the European Games this year to call on more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he complained because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-year-old world champion said that the fact that he was loved to a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Daley was married to the Oscarwinaar last year, which is 20 years older than he was, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have to stay so young," he participated in his first Olympic Games at a quarter-year-old age and his father died three years later in cancer, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has added the same high and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all perspective" was changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it all worked for the win of a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than the winning of gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son named the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after receiving the diagnosis of resonance cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the cards for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't get it on my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hand firmly when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he wasn't infinity," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won his source.
"I knew I had been dreaming about this all my life. To thank a public during the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musician, Proud by Heather Small, who had taken him hard on the way to the games and where he still got a kick.
Desert Island Discs is to be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to see his form back to make no sad moods.
Mickelson, who participated for the 12th time in the two-year event, was put on the bank by the captain Jim Furyk team for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors spends the day supporting his teammates and training on driving ranges, in an effort to delay it.
Since he was never even known on the tip of his career for his right drive, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the nearby Le Golf National fairs, where the long grass of the roughs is breaking loose ball routinely.
And if the job itself is not exciting enough, Mickelson will come to the ninth match on Sunday at the perfect Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, well start, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has made it seem to trust this man, although he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a beating on the back, beat his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been enrolled in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to this team in the past but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to just play two games.
I had more to expect, but it's like it and it's the way we have to deal with it.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely attained the heights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches, and 7 matches stand on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain adverse influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's tired, he's happy to take out jokes with people, and he's a great fan to have in the team," he said.
"I think the young players found it fun to take him off and then keep him in front of the geek last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than his game alone."
Thomas Björn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can soon be lost
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows that the comfort source prior to the single match on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danishs were engaged in the battle in Valderrama in 1997, where the team, as Captain Seven Ballesteros, had a five-point front on the Americans, but eventually the final line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131/2.
"You keep yourself in mind that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we were, but just," said Bjorn, quoted here, after he had seen the 2018 lighting with 5-3 on Friday and tomorrow, well for a 10-6 spring on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone's gonna have to get in full tomorrow.
Go to the battle and get the plan out of the way.
It's not going beyond the points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's how this trophies win, and we need to keep focusing on it.
I continue to say, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Delighted about the performances of his players on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go on in this field.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow the individual benefits will come to order, and that is a very different discipline again.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's going well, but when you're there alone, your abilities as a golfer are actually tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, trying to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he should get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to do better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who crossed three of the four points.
Fury himself experienced both sides of this kind around the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he replied in response to the question of Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, his players had appointed for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the book tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medinah.
When we have the moment, there's a lot of pressure on the games in the middle.
We agreed on this and sent the men on the way to the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high court tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the rival and Rory McIlroy in the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we've been so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
The New War of Germany Again
The latest fleet of the German sea would have to come into service in 2014, replacing the former warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will still last at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and current costs, reported local media.
The establishment of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the beautiful Baden-Wuerttmberg class, is now released until the first half of 2019, according to the news sheet The time a military spokesman calls.
The vessel would have had to be part of the sea in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have resulted in the fall of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wurttemberg class that the sea has ordered in 2007 are used to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of airborne and antiship rockets and a form of steelth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to insert the latest questionnaires up to two years after each other, away from home.
However, the ongoing negotiations mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project their power over, have been older than the time they are taken into business, notes the Time.
Last year the emergency fleet F125 seized all of the cargoheads, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in business and sent it back to the shipyard Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine sent a ship back to a shipyard after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were to be put into a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wurttemberg class ships are operated by a crew of about 120 sails, half the manpower on the cargoes of the old Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweight, which would reduce its performance and limit the marine possibilities for further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a comparable class as were introduced by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the disabled hardware, the price card for the full project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a thousand-week €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest issues in their grip are extremely important because of the recent warnings that the German Navy is taking over.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the sea actually has "a lack of intelligible ships".
The operator said that the problem of time as a snowball has been raised because old ships were kept from business but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the requests from the Baden-Wurttemberg class were available to be included in the sea.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Vulnerables
A new research carried out on a landscape in the Scottish hills tries to discover how to use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying animals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland is followed by the usual and small milling mill, the brown wholesaler mill and the water mill at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the country to follow the activities of the muscles by the season.
NTS employees and volunteers are also conducting mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the movements of the muscle and what kind of action it does.
A map of the population is then produced and a report is produced to make such a detailed picture on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural protection monitor, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for poultry mice and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of landfills and how we can best keep the forests for wildlife and similar species.
The majority of the population in Scotland and the rest of the U.S. have been significantly absent in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that have an impact on shelters and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, just like pilots and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks by households.
Vleermuses are not really blind.
However, their nightly hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a proo.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
The NTS, responsible for providing over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares to land in the country, is taking very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, conduct inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue actions.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve for livestock in Scotland at the village of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where the ten species of livestock live in Scotland.
Agriculture manager David Thompson says the landscape is the ideal territory for the wildlife.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for animals," he said.
"We have old buildings, very very old trees and the right habitat.
But there's so much we know about bats, and that's why the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to do."
It stresses the importance of control of pregnant women before maintenance activities are carried out, as the possible unintended destruction of a place of sleep can result in the death of 400 female babies and their young children, which may lead to the destruction of a complete local population.
Vleermuses are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall or to save them, or to destroy their sleeping facilities.
Elisabeth Ferrrell, Schots, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to provide a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our animals and many of our species, we just don't know how it goes with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of harassment while his lawyers prepare themselves to follow a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo's charges of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'will themselves promote' by using his name.
His lawyers are on the point of complaining about the German weekly newspaper Der Spiegel, in which the charges have been published.
The visit of Portugal and Juventus is charged with the arrest of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also charged with paying her $375.000 to deny the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
According to a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33 hours after the charges were reported, reported 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Ballens on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling themselves my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and by and by good," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a legal case for which they want to proceed with the charges they called 'an inalienable report of thoughts in the area of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the footballer would like compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount consistent with the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious damages to personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the football room, where he encouraged her to read in the complaint filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was hit after the related incident on his kidneys and that he told her that for '99 percent' he was a 'good wind', but that he was sometimes left in the stack that 'one percent'.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that he had a couple of sex, but that he had found it on the other hand.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there are photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial order because she was 'fearful for the consequences' and because she was worried about the 'public degradation'.
The 34-year-old is now saying that she wants to make the order invalid because she is constantly traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo stood at the point of Manchester United to go to Real Madrid during the mixed round, and this summer to the Italian giant Juventus was left in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'Zal has suffered forever' as self-producing producers
The United Kingdom 'zal there' has always been regrettably 'as its status as world leader in the field of self-production has been lost after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that when Toyota UK had said against the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of 'no-deal Brexit' jobs would be costly.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avenues of Toyota are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that as Great Britain runs out of the EU in March, we will see the production in our factory" said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced their concerns about the consequences of an EU departure without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most self-producing people are concerned about the risks in delivery chains in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota’s production line is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, where every 37-minute parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars to be ordered.
If the EU left the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a disappointment at the limits which the industry considers to be likely to lead to delays and cuts in shares.
Toyota cannot store supplies in the Derbyshire factory for more than one day, so the company knows, and would therefore stop production.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly agreed to avoid those controls at the border'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's today program.
"It proves, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, that we can definitely go with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but it warned for the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitiveness and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the Union's company at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back again.
A spokesman from the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Greeting by Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed once more, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can't be held for a week, while the debate on the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, went on, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of the activities of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the influence of the Russian elections, links between Tromp and Russia's assistants and possible impediments to the access to justice by the President.
The question of Trump is going to be solved by the Deputy Prosecutor General and thereby endangers Mueller's independence, the Washington rolling machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to establish talks with Trump and to put the President down through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, they called the round that he was about to enter his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he 'did not want to escape' Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing by the Senate's Justice Commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which allowed the vote to be postponed in the whole Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the bishop of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked to meet with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set for it, it could be this week, but it could also be issued for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press on high."
Some rapporteurs had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The guest Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the worst of persconferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'paying attention' TV journalists, however, they added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then they suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President does more questions and replies than any president for him," she said, without giving proof: "We have looked at the figures."
Persconferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is rather much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've often seen that last week and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending public sessions or during press conferences with visitors.
Conferences with the President alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated possible why he made an open and strange appearance for the rapporteurs gathered.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express appreciation for the country and the desire to continue working with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK returned from the EU.
The Scottish Government has absolutely prepared to bear the costs of applying for a stable status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UN and the EU will continue, and the expected decisions will be taken this autumn.
At the same time, however, the government of the UK has also signed the preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no discussion.
I know this is some time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve NHS's activities and offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fixed and sure you're home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undertakes a quick operation after a head injury
The Tennissee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, received an early operation yesterday after he had crossed a major battle with the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesean.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the line and sat there a little or more," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie directly oxygen on the line before they placed him on a straight line and named him for further research.
A member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was coming from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'there are no details yet known about the type/the extent of the lease' and Tennessee State when the lease was located.
Abercrombie, a 'reshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was arrested on Saturday in a total of five times before leaving the field, which made him arrested 18 times in a total of 18 times.

This action is seen as an effort to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success that young voters attract with promises to provide more affordable houses and to tell it to many servers.
The increase in law is brought to the attention of persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, where extra income is maintained in an effort by the government to fight indiscriminateness.
The aid, which comes above the current law, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for two houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to reach £ 120 million per year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This creates prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the tenant.
Many well-being areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spooch cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson had launched a reduction in the law to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by buying and not using the land and calling May to create quotas on paymentable houses to restore the 'householding' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of housing reforms, including housing funds and an end to the "without disability".
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as the first prime minister on restoring the 'British Dream', making life better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always open for people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple as it is for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here if it is for hard-working British citizens.
For too many people, the dream is never to have a house that has become a great dream and the destruction of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to be ever managed by Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of relieving the club from northeastern England, which is currently in the third place in League One, on three points from the first place.
He went off to the Stadium of Light in the summer after he had returned to the Scottish Premiership the previous season in St. Mirren.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my father's country.
But I was selected for the B team and with it was the choice," Ross told Sports Sound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw my father Scotland play often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps me attracted.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
The presidents of Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former base of Alloa Athletic says that he was not suspended to become the successor of these established names at a large club, he had previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is now measured by 'can I let this club go back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, this is undoubtedly the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can see myself as successful when I bring the club back there again."
Ross is only three years involved with his career as manager, after a period of time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the training group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to the victory of the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a football player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a cross point," he reminded himself of the moment he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I'm doing the best I've ever done, I've earned quite well, and I've known a few reasonable points.
But football can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're dealing with each other every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the shop, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, unattended
The summer heatball has increased the income of British pubs who are struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurants.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rising by 2.7% in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8 percent lower, show the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Bureau, who collected the figures, said: "For the time being the sun, and the fact that England is more than expected to participate in the world's campaigns, means that July sees a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had more than 2.8% turnover, with the difference that the restaurants are now being hit.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the distribution of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that are focused on the sale of alcohol provided from the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants were reduced.
Pubs that are also directed to the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people are just on the edge of drinking.
In pubs and bars under management, the drinking area was 6.6% higher for the month, while the food supply was 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the free-time and host-free industry, said: "These results will continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the main factors for the market in the waste market.
It is not surprising, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to complain, although a 4.8 per cent turnover per year is particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer was possible for operators who did not come on food directions at a bad time and will only learn if the more moderate temperatures of August could provide the necessary response."
The total turnover in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the rise from the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.

Survey of 20,000 students from high school found growth in 'false Insta-pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be postulated
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'hofdaaccount' that they also show their parents.
One of the five children, single not older than 11 years, makes social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is postulated.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'hofdaaccount' to show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who came to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site in case of an accident found out that a teenager had to ‘ force her ’ to others.
The study carried out by Digital Avaress UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools revealed that 40 percent of the 11-to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them were allowed to monitor personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's amazing that so many teenagers are abandoned to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilyh Doyle will be the 'vote' voice in the Scottish athletic council
Eilyh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Athletic World as the non-executive director during the general annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athletes in Scotland on the job and in the field and president Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports managers to learn from her extended experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilih enjoys much respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will greatly benefit from her choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help to manage sports in Scotland."
The American who lived 200 metres and 400 metres during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of its four Olympic medals, and who now regularly comment on the BBC, could no longer run after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will teach me whether I will recover and how much.
It's been a terrible job, but I'm completely restored now, I've learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!

Advertising for breast pumps in which mothers are compared with dogs, distributed online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an announcement in which such mothers are compared to dogs that are breast-feeding.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called the 'most silent breast pump in the world', Elvie, a producer of consumer technology, issued an ironic, inspired announcement on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to cool mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a squeal filled with hoe on a song that contains texts like, 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't have it in the streets, these are no eggs, these are my breasts'.
The refrigerator then follows: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's's.
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has resulted in hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions by viewers, in which many people say that in this case the 'horror' of the coal industry is being rewarded.
"A bad choice to use dogs to warn this product.
Like us, they should be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the vaccination" is written in a reaction.
Elvie's breast pump fits discrete in a food bag (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: "It's, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to warn mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This announcement is so far away from reality."
Others defended the announcement and gave a woman when she found the song 'hilarish'.
"I find this a great idea.
I'd make an appointment if I still had breast feeding.
That pumps made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much.
This is a great product" someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "It's a funny advertising, directed to moms who's cold (often at work or in a toilet) and then it's just feeling like 'choice'.
This advertising is not entirely positive or negative about the coal industry."
At the end of the video, you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who are cold sometimes don't feel bad.
The Elvie Pump is completely quiet, however, has no clothes or shoes and fits discrete in a food bag, so women have the freedom to move, to keep their babies fixed and even to go out while they are at cold.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is thus a revolutionary product that deserves a strong and provocative introduction.
By comparison between cold mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the cold and the associated challenges in the mirror and to show in a sustainable and understandable way how the new pump for an incredible feeling of freedom will be provided.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on Martha Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children slowly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of targeted migrants has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the strong rhetoric and strong policy introduced by the Trump government, making it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and they are afraid of their own chance to remain in the country by reporting for a child.
This risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the convention that his organization has arrested hundreds of people who have reported themselves as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organisation later confirmed that 70 per cent of the prisoners had no previous criminal record.
"By 80 per cent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part are criminal foreigners.
We are about to follow these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules, whereby a few of them are obliged within one month after the start of the detention, to appear before the court, instead of within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the workers at the Shelter.
Many of them will be present at a video conference for the Court, instead of in person, to order their application for a legal status for an immigration lawyer.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for aid will be deported soon.
The longer children remain pregnant, the greater the chance that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent eruptions or refugees, according to the workers at the Shelter and according to reports received from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns were stronger at a greater facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child being beaten more often, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally here or to say good - bye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are still struggling with.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called back the Syrian refugees, even now the war in the country occurs in the eighth year.
Moulalem, also vice-president, said that foreign troops were illegally on the Syrian border, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'that would be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been unrecorded and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this holy war until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "probably illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly those involved in training and counseling the Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-ridden country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he intends to 'several Western countries spread ironic fears', which makes most of the refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicians who should be just a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid is available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the most important revolution of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The division between Russia and Turkey has resulted in a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
Moulalem pointed out, however, that this agreement was known as 'explained deadlines' and said he hoped that the military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including fighters of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, who would be 'exploited'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN official, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to design a framework law for the post-war war for Syria and to open the way for elections.
Moulalem made it clear what the conditions of the Syrian Government were to take part in the Commission and said that the work of the panel should be limited to 'to review the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against the inclusion of outsiders.
Why Trump won a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency will continue to be terminated by an employment procedure and scandals.
There is no doubt that 'the most dramatic final of a presidency' would ever be.
At this point, however, there are no signs of blindness.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at CNN is more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly doubled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'primary-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the evaluations for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at night with important news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series of ministers who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
It reminds itself of a taxi ticket in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,' said Scowell to me.
There's a value of interest in chaos.
Of course, contrary to everything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade, or determine whether immigrant families can re-enter or influence the status of the world economy.
Emissions is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it will be more than a well-known citizen when you get in the streets that you've been sitting on a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which has about the jack of Pope Paul Manafort who has cost $15,000 (a garment full of overmood' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the color description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, the Anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's going to be a reality show, is partly that he stops you every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the manufacturer of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotational role distribution of the Trump show and the daily fleet changes (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong- and praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was Sunday and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was in sight of MSNBC while he entered CNN.
He could not get out of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear before the Senate's Justice Commission and the future of the Supreme Court who was at stake.
"I remember that we all did those rare shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'it's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it seems they were right."

External cash flows in the most exciting medium-term elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an abundance of money, thanks to a re-location of a electoral district, whereby two people sitting on the same seat have to fight.
The newly relocated district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's representative Conor Lamb, who has stolen his seat in another district in a special election lens.
Lamb must be taken up against another people's representative, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is well aware of the new 17th district.
The cards were re-shared after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unlawfully divided ('greymanding') for the benefit of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout party in the field of campaign funding between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nice victory in a well-known special election for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been owned by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump has crossed this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered El Salvador to be punished for aid to China and rejected it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners set up the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to call back the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on 'the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore' said Heather Nauert, head of the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But only punishment was considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
While the internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic well-being as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
However, in mid-September some officials from the government knew that they wanted the conference to go through, thereby making all possible criminal measures against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence has a speech on the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the government is assigned to the meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American soldiers have been sent back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without strong messages of criminal action in Washington.
A speaker from the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate under anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also speaks for anonymity.
Learn History
The next step may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible anti-discrimination of Trump, for which serious evidence has now been made public.
Mueller's research is likely also aimed at consensualizing between the campaign of Trump and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must be responsible for that institution, just as he prepares himself to return to the voters, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a court court.
That is a hope, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, even those of its equivalents in Europe.
There will need to be elections by all of us, both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the war will last.
In 1938 German officers were ready to execute a 'cop d'État' against Hitler, but only if the West had ordered resistance and Chechcho-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We lost and lost an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points and the unfathomable memory of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with various of these types of curves.
What are we going to do when Trump adjunt-Procurator-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's research in hand?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this page reported that he had suggested, last year, to hold talks with the President in secret and that he had been specific about the right of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report doesn't work.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or honest, or if he is named in the Supreme Court despite religious charges of assault and an invalid witness?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that Trump will be responsible for?
When we fall into these tests, democracy waits for a very long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fall by the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech iodine who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever had my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me, 60 years later, away to pick up cards for the Sabbath on the table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the fight against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they are placed in a strong position to qualify in Group G of Europe League.
The middle-fielder Graham Dorrans was not able to play his first game of the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believed that the Rangers could use the results as a jump plan for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the fight with the idea that there was a lot to win and the fight came out with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end, but as we saw the whole battle, it's probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the best runner.
The next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can hold three points, but it is going to be a tough fight because they have also had a good outcome in their last fight, but if the public is behind us, I am sure that we can press and that we can achieve a positive outcome.
Last year has certainly been hard, of all that happened with my blessings and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a fault factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it, the training is good.
Hopefully we can now print, leave the last season behind us and be successful again."
Women can't sleep because of fear of their pensions
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they want to get care, few people discuss this with their families.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they do not take the steps they need to take to make this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president for life insurance at the Nationalwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for taking care of them if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arms: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash to help cover these expenses, or establish its own capacity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set legal documents: Avoid legal conflict when the insurance is to be entered.
Take care of your health care, so that you can show a trusted person who can look after your medical care and make sure that the professionals will be able to communicate in case you are unable to communicate anymore.
Consider also the full power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that the factors are paid if you can no longer do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Suppose your aged father or mother has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Set these details in a written plan so that you have the information available to you.
"It's not just the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares about the dog?
Make sure that the plan comes."
Several times you were beaten with air pressure in Ilfracombe
One man was arrested several times by an air pressure officer when he walked home after a while.
The victim, forty plus, was found in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, neck and hand.
Agents describe the decision, which took place about 02:30 BST, as a 'optional'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His surprises are not life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that has hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and it is expected that the death toll will increase further.
As soon as the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donghea Republic, a region north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the fortress with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donghia, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Midden-Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with a estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was 40 years old when the tsunami hit.
Donghea is a rainforest that extends over more than 300 km along the coast of northwestern Celebes.
The government, an administrative region under a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the most important activities in the economy of the Province of Mid-Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donghea.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are for the majority in Morouli, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dodhea have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disasters Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghea.
A tsunami struck in the west of Donghea in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh, north of Sumatra, on 26 December, provided for a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed total 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of it in Atjeh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, for the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place in southern Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast and claimed almost 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found the death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands, at the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: An unusual earthquake struck the Pidie River in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.

Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-presidentship, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on memory of domestic violence, inclusion in a report of domestic violence and supply of resistance during the trial, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman known tried to call the police to report the alleged offenders, he took her phone off.
Palin is kept in custody in the home of storage Mat-Su with a 500-dollar, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, sure' when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is charged for three violations of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged for a violation of Class B, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017 he was charged with the abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for Alaska's Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of a domestic abuse, including a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His friend claimed he had shot her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans, after she had linked the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, which he would have remained in his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while the expected death rate will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the center of Celebes, located in the northeastern part of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed, a rare punishment that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a hired truck from Home Depot to launch an attack on a train path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was on foot and on his way, about October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the complainants will have to prove that Sajpov 'opportunity' has killed the eight victims and has brought serious physical injuries, according to the intentional declaration in which the death penalty is requested, which has been submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both complaints, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted by the Court.
One week after the attack, a federal high court approved the submission of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typically a complaint used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'substantial planning and preparation', according to the complainants, and they describe the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'grossy, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habibellajevish Sajpov has brought harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco" is the intentional statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
More than ten years ago, a case in the Southern District of New York arose in which the death penalty was imposed.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after two years of being sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both repaired by the electric steel on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not provide a statement of complaint in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the researcher know that he felt good about his work, she was the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the complaint.
He also asked for ISIS's flag to be placed in his room in the hospital, the police told him.
He was not charged with the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the complainants.
"We believe that the decision to accept the death penalty instead of a criminal confession in place of a life sentence without the possibility of being released will only extend the trauma of these events to all those involved," Patton said.
The defense of Sajpov had previously called on the complainants not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised a more popular mobilization today during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians must feel the "hit" of Eurosceptic, while one of the own parliamentarians of Theresa May suggested that he be led by negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the March in Birmingham that the VK 'would already be out' as Mr. Farage Brexit-Minister.
However, the challenge posed by May in connection with the delivery of the highly distributed past is underlined by two conservatives that are pro-Remain and which participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister insists on keeping her Chequers compromise on track while being attacked by Brexitaires, Remainers and the EU.
Contestants felt that they would go on and try to close a deal with Brussels despite the opposition, and so Eurosceptic and Labor had to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leeve Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'chequers in the dustman'.
He suggested that Farage should be corrected and that he should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the job, we'd be out now," said Bone.
The Members of Parliament for Wellingborough added here: "I will support Brexit, but we must shoot Chequers in the dustman."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be defeated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
It is good to suggest that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely inconceivable."
Conservative Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is unpopulated in the large public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopulated in our party and our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let Chequers fall down and listen."
In a specific message for May, they added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel 'hit' if they decided to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political classes," he said.
"They're trying to save Brexit and we're here today to tell them, "Let's not get out of here."
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put the fire in our political class, which is on Brexit point.
We will mobilize the peoples of this country that we have cared for in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this March with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists tired with flags where Tories Against Brexit stood after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the High House for Labor, made comments on the security problems of a Party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide for IT systems and for all technology for Canada plus, for the unlimited limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete race.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan 'good to think' about presidential candidate
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll 'well remember her presidential candidate' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Moscow Democrat told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, wanted to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republicans who was co-chaired by the campaign of Trum in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's the midpoint of speculation that she might be going to war with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday morning in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A present woman asked if she would make herself available to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
arrest after death of Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, let us know on Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00.
In addition, they gave a video free of charge on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who is seen in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in the head and died after it," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and was known to be present at the scene guilty, in possession of a gun and killed Wyade Sims.
Simpson is arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a young player of 1.98 metres who was raised in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after Sebastian Vettel gave him the victory for team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that a team of Mercedes orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from the pole position and almost stopped Hamilton in the kitchen when he defended his position and called for Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and left Hamilton in the dark runnings in the front of the group, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes went a little later into the pits and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came back to the head after a wheel-up action which required the Ferrari driver to release on the inside after a double movement in the third floor.
Max Steps started from the last place and was seven after the first round on his 21st anniversary.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he remained at his band selection and hung on fast finish, so that he could catch Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went to the 44th round to the pits, where he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me over.
The team did its best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body chair.
President Donald Trump spoke during a selection meeting on Saturday about the fact that she was not fully the source of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of sedition.
Speaking at a election meeting in West Virginia, the president had not directly heard of the witness given by Ford for the Senate's Justice Commission, and instead he knew that this evening in the Senate would show that people could be 'common, inequity and indiscriminate'."
"There is nothing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate during the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and united and together and unsuspecting and unsuspecting," he said.
"When you look at the press and the toys and that they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
You know that yet?
Diane Feinstein, are you lying?
You still know her answer... you put the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lie.'
Well, wait a minute.
He added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter stating the charges at the address of Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and was filed in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was ill.
"I haven't kept Dr. Fords' charges hidden, I haven't finished her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with her in a confidential manner, and I treated her as she asked."
But the president refused to believe her rejection, and he made a comment at the meeting on Saturday evening: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body chair.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that was the worst body chair I've ever seen."
In addition to defending the candidate for the High Court, which is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power, with all necessary means.
You see the community, the injustice, they don't give anything to those who hurt them, about whom they have to drive to take power and get back control," the president would have said in a media report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two dollars for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have approved the loss of free day in the Elite League against Belfast Giant by winning the war of return with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two golds led by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the house away before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the same maker for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen made sure that the victory was won.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make a stand on Friday night to punish Dundee later with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two races met together, where the Giants won the previous three wars.
The opening hall of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on a visit from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistance that Beauvillier had doubled, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the presentation to the same maker of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants, with a spring from the first break, made his second round of the night at the end of the first period.
The housekeeper repacked himself and Bouchard brought them back to a level equal to a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen for the first time in the battle, leaving him in the second period. He took care of the winning with the fifth dollar for his team, halfway in the last period.
The giants, who have lost four of the last five wars, play home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic leader dies while he ensures that hundreds of passengers can fly the ground in a plane
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could be safely aboard.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been lost after a heavy earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake that caused tsunamis.
Powerful naschos still admire the area and many are buried under the bridge in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild Heen-en-Water traffic areas of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at the moment ready on the start, could be lifted safely.
Then he was expelled from the streets, when he thought it was on fire.
He died in the hospital later.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision has saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter arranged by Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could increase to the thousands, and let the country’s disaster control agency know that access to the cities of Donghea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"I believe that the death rate continues to rise because many bodies are under the yoke and are not yet reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
The waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where one will keep a massive funeral day.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimum markets are being scaled all over."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race complicated to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to do.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived on Sunday in Palu and he said to the present military: "I call on all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for the evacuation will be completed.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Airport crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the valley
The air carrier who carried out the flight that was crashed in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says that another man is missing after they had mentioned that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the wounded aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press report that one male passenger is missing on Saturday morning.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the requests for more details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane was hit by too much water during the landing on the Chuke Island.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains uncertain for a long time.
The airline and the U.S. Marine both say that the aircraft has failed in the lake and the landing route.
Some witnesses believe that the plane over the landing path has been shot.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane neared the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him that he and some others had been hit by the water, which came through their midst, to the emergency exits of the thinking plane.
He also said that the stairwells were panicked and screamed and that he had no serious headache.
The U.S. Marine reported that seafarers who were close to work on a ship also helped rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with a portable boat before the plane continued to sink about 30 meters deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last twenty-first year 111 people have found the death in crashes of airlines registered at PNG, but that none of this has anything to do with Air Niugini.
Analystizes the timeline of the night when a woman is burned alive
The complainant concluded his claim on Friday in the open process of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, left a witness for several hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he used the data from mobile phones to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, during the night she was alive.
Rowlett explained that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis at Chambers on the night of her death, which was in line with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Leiger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police again talked to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the witness station on Saturday and told him he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis spoke the truth when he told him that he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was 'false 'cause my truck was then in Nashville'.
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
The mobile phone data showed that they knew each other in just one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew some time after the death of Chambers the e-mails, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from her life," said Hale.
The defense begins Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start that day with the recommendations.
What is 'conscious hipop'?
A hipoptrio wants to put the negative image of the genre to the discussion by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol reports that the hipop has been disturbed by the origin of political opinions and the accumulation of social problems.
They want to return to the root and 'conscious hipop' again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced another experience in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A bride from New York makes a marriage for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A young woman from New York makes a couple for the judge on grounds of divorce for discriminatory reasons, after she received a wrong text in which the mother was complaining about 'the weather' as black as she was.
The couple refuse to be racist and call the case 'afpression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her disappointment when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, became a negroid woman when she met her first day of work in 2016.
'NEEEEE WEER' AND ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the New York Post said that she felt 'impossible' when she realized her blubber, and she explained that her former wife, Afro-Americans, had given her a bad job and that she was waiting for a Philippines.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Maurice now renders the right to receive a compensation of $350,-- per day for the six months she was hired to stay in the family, or without contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do this,' Maurice said on Friday in the New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple abstained from the claim that they were racist by saying that it was reasonable to escape Maurice after they had threatened her, fearing that they could no longer trust her.
'My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not a racist, married Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who had hurt you, even though it was an accident?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.'
Regarding the case of justice compared to 'apersing', Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby over two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
You followed someone like that?
That's not so sympathic, the investment banker added.
While the case is still under way, the public opinion is quick to share the couple's social media, where they are targeted for their conduct and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking beer, despite a newly published letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said about the letter: 'It's hard to be in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time, even for the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it's very easy.'
She told her father who, before being inspired to write the book on a small playbook, when a cameraman worked at the British sender BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, and she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'biterzoet' was after his death.
About Paddington, who describes her as a 'very prominent member of the family', she told her father that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, well-known man."
'But since Paddington was so alive for him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud while you did nothing for yourself.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he used the beer himself for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone.
Immediately after the land, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
'What had been called several times to say that there was a very bad appearance and that it was expected they wouldn't get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then Nad's phone came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to get away from her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumped, slowly developed and lost her body.
She had been dead for a while, and this process went on.
I could just sit there and know what's going on.
I couldn't hold, cry or cry, because I was between people and families.
I really had to be big.'
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now stole her daughter's death from the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what temptation she had to face.
'No one knew it,' she said.
'I went down with my head, and the tears just came.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got a great feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.'
Rouling women place messages on use to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their lives by suicide make it hard for others to maintain their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 when he was depressed for the first time and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
'I don't want any parents to feel like I feel like I feel every day,' she said.
Mrs Davis, 45-year-old and living in Lydney in Gloucestershire, says that her son was a promising head-cook with a pleasant edge.
'He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lighted every room.'
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deep in the pot.'
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had dedicated his life to him.
Mrs Davis said, 'I'm constantly making sure there's a chain reaction.'
Mrs Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, though it's just a friend.
Don't be shy - talk about it.'
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
'He didn't say he felt somber or depressed or something,' she said.
'A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally on the ground on the first Christmas day - when the children packed their gifts, he didn't look at them at all or like that.'
She said that her death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to work it out: 'It robs the whole family out of each other.
It's driving us out.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting.'

Brett Kavanaughs is uncertain about the future while FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could actually get what he asks; a limited investigation in time and size, then perhaps we could again create more unity,' so Mr. Flake concluded on Saturday, which he added, that he was afraid that the committee 'from each other' would fall, in the middle of a firmly promised settlement within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
She's got everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been five weeks, on 6 November, and as the Republics are expected to do the wrong, their efforts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are extremely difficult.
George W. Bush has already invited members of the United States Senate to congratulate Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes the report?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would offer Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to vote in favour of a certain vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of survivors in North Korea under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen to South Korea since Kim Young and seven years ago.
Park Byeong-zeug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Single World, states that there were 1.127 survivors last year, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that more border controls between North Korea and China, and higher sanctions for human rights abusers are the most important factors for the decline.
Pyongyang didn't react in public.
Finally, the vast majority of the survivors from North Korea are offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and where you can easily cross the border than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors more illegal than refugees and often resorts to violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in the process of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in large lines to work on the Korean nuclear disarmament.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. of the lack of progress since the adoption of American sanctions.
'Without faith in the conduct of the U.S., there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', so Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterisch', and finds him incapacitated to serve the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, nominated candidate judge for U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'histerish', and finds him unable to serve in the High Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman would behave that way, but her 'hissterisch' would be called,' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaughs witness to the Senate Commission for Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was moved by the allegations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were two teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited; he was often screaming and was especially from the area when he told about his family and his secondary school time.
He also strongly condemned the democracies in the committee, in which he called the charges against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she found that Kavanaughs testified that he was not qualified to serve the Supreme Court because he was fully condemned against the Democrats.
'I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats', so Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether they would try to introduce an impasse procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'That's what I can say; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he's not only qualified for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving,' said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the 'District of Colombia' (mainly short D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the law on paying for health care).
Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the High Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to smile if there's now a hysterical, pre-prioral person in the Supreme Court', so Pelosi.
Women should just be allowed here.
It is a fair tirade of months and years of intense anger that passes, and they can only cry to get it out.
'We're going to cry if we get angry,' said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was a guide and who told me that she also cried when she was angry. She developed a method, where she always cried when she was angry.
I'm angry.'
And then she just cried.
I just thought it was brilliant.'
Trawls are partially released as an expression of anger, because tears are largely misunderstood.
One of my best memories of an earlier job, in a man-dominated office, was when I was afraid to cry because I was angry. An older woman, a boy company leader who was a little scared of everyone, grabbed me into my neck and locked me in a trap house.
'Don't let her see that you're crying,' she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy that they've got you in the box.
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Congress in Colorado for Democrats, worked for Gary Hart for his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an outdoor affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally 'kattenwood' or 'openways') and withdrew from the race, thinking that Mrs. Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she would not be a candidate for herself.
'It wasn't an arbitrary decision,' she told me 30 years later laughing.
'There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone had it about 'Sneew White and the seven doors'.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind fund-raising, so she promised not to do it properly if she could not earn $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, only wanted to give her $250.
'May they think I'm getting a little short?' she asked herself.
When she held her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who supported her, of frustration that the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of dispossessed, and of anger about sexism - that she was involved.
'I'll have thought I got a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media reacted to her.
'They'll have thought Kleneex was my business sponsor.
I still remember thinking what they're gonna put on my graveyards?
"What did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be welcomed for Beijing
The openings of the trade conflict between the US and China were overwhelming, and although the war had not been fought long ago, a gap between the two countries could be welcomed by experts in the long term for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning this year by raising taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates amounted to $200 billion (€150 billion) for goods, half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Peking has taken in natural repressions every time, most recent by increasing prices from 5 to 10% for US$60 billion.
China has every time told the U.S. to match, and the world will probably not be hit by the eyes soon.
In order for Washington to be left behind, requests should be made voluntarily, but public tenders for the U.S. is too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays the silence, the trade war with the US, China, would be able to support the long-term positive side by taking away the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, which could lead one of the two countries to a fair economic fall, is actually much more dangerous than those that have previously acknowledged,' says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the 'Center for a New American Security', an idea specializing in national security issues that focuses on Asia.
Syria 'clear' to let refugees return, so Foreign Minister
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven years of war.
During his talk at the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, announced that the situation in his country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he says.
The government will be able to rehabilitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation locally.
All circumstances now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the only economic measures that threaten their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war started in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would help restore the lost country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional aid or aid from countries that had subsidised the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team will defeat the '2018 Ryder Cup' by the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' in southern France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the Ryder Cup has not won in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish carrier team, Thomas Bjorn, held the required number of 14.5 points to punish the U.S.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost the entire tournament, left his long shot from the tea in the water at the 3rd floor 16th floor and gave his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, was shot in all its rounds and was one of the four players who have ever played 5-0-0 since the tournament in its present form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was driven from it by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranked player on the World Cup list, Dustin Johnson, loses 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which is possible as a final match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, was the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
'I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything.
It's been a hard year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we're back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help, said an enthusiastic Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the falcon to his native, John Ram, who will go to the American lying Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The enormous pride I feel because I've reported Tiger Woods. I've always followed that waiting when I grew up,' so the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four battles in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major campaign units, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairs, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played all the tournament at high level.
The American carrier, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his flight: 'I'm proud of these boys, they've fought.
A short time ago, we have made Europe even more difficult.
We're under attack.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great driver.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You need to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed.'
Red glad update: Concentrations taken from the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the 'Florida Fish and Forest Conservation Commission' (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Vis and Fauna) shows a general decline in red glass concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area (based on the west coast of Florida in the U.S.).
According to the Commission, there is a fragmentary increase in the Red gold in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red glow extends from medium 200 km coast, from north Pinellas to the south Lee county.
There are about 16 km to the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
There's also Rode glad seen in Pasco County.
There are medium-sized concentrations reported for the Pinellas County coast last week, low to high concentrations for the Himalayasborough County coast, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or at the Sarasota County coast, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or for the Lee County coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
It is still reported on the irritation of the airports in the provinces of Pinnellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwestern part of Florida, no notification was made of the irritation of the airways in the past week.
