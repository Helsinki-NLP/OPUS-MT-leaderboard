Last minute: Cosmic Visitor Dev Asteroid 2014 JO25
In the solar system, there are perhaps billions of stars that are more likely to cause serious consequences than they are when they travel and cross the solar system.
The way of these objects that are hidden from the sun's creation can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The asteroid that runs 650 meters 2014 JO25 will be such a visitor, and today at 14:24 a.m., the nearest place in the world will be 1.55 million miles away.
We've been hearing this kind of news since yesterday.
The most important reason for this is the development of surveillance techniques and inspection tools.
We also have the opportunity to identify smaller asteroids that are not previously identified.
For example, in the month of October, only half of the world's world's and the Moon's average average average of 250,000 miles (~250,000 km) of bus size went through a table.
And more interesting asteroids could only be identified a few days ago.
I mean, there might be other cosmic buses coming up to us right now.
What would you do if you learned that you had an asteroid that ran 20 meters away?
Actually, it won't destroy your asteroids in this size, but it's probably gonna blow up all the buildings.
This will be the reason why the asteroids spread from asteroids in the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013 the asteroid down to Russia was in these sizes and enough to divide the windows of several city buildings.
But if you have a 100-metre asteroid target, you're at least 50 km away from your position of advice.
These are the factors that determine the depth of crater and the severity of the crater, such as the size of asteroid and the opening of the burst.
According to the European Space Agency's simulation, let's look at a few scenarios.
If an asteroid is opened at 45 degrees per second, about 250 metres in depth and 1200 meters in diameter, it will be a crater.
The pressure of Richter is equal to 6 times the pressure, and even if you're 10 kilometers to the point of impact, your body will reach 3 degrees.
They're going to be waiting for the windows to be split in 50 km.
If you hit an asteroid within a mile, the situation's gonna get a little more complicated.
It's the same open and fast-state asteroid that hits the Earth about 600 meters deep and a crater within 12 km.
I mean, a husband turns into a crater, and it's time to be gone.
Even if you're 100 km away from the drop point, the resulting oil comes to your body at 3rd level.
The impression of Richter's size is equal to the depressive value of the 8th force.
The damage to asteroids is not just the chemical combination of asteroids, but also the chemical production of asteroids that will affect the environment.
The values above are given from the centre of the center of the scenario of an asteroid, such as a solid rock, which is caused by torrential storms.
If the asteroid is caused by a majority of the north, if the lavender is placed on a surface with a surface that has been formed with a crater, the crater size will rise 3 times and the gap between it will also be reduced.
And before this, 66 million people have been hit by something better than dinosaurs, and they've been hit by an asteroid that lasts about ten miles away.
Because of the asteroid attack, 75 percent of the sea and cara animal has disappeared.
If the dinosaurs were to destroy this great asteroid, it would be the safest choice to leave the planet.
Every day in the earth, there are tons of material.
Most of this is burning up in the atmosphere.
After all, there are some big heavens in the atmosphere, which are known as the source of stars among the people.
Let's finish our letter with another message that will comfort us.
Events show that over the past 300-400 years, there is no reason to expect a major asteroid to hit the Earth.
I'm sure it's been a relief for you as an animal for 70 years.
Flash for medel: EUR 10 million!
Gary Medel, who's just looking at the name of the Black and White people who want to take up the Stoper region, is looking forward to leaving Inter in the day.
The 30-year-old football player, who started working with the Internet in the past few days, is looking forward to his next offer.
Italy's prestigious newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, also a stopper, and a pre-liberal Medel, pointed out that Besiktash made a 10m euros offer to the Inter.
When it was announced that the Black-Beasts, who offered Medel, were both expected to respond, it was indicated that the Chilean football club was warm enough to live with his family in Istanbul.
Kara Kar Kartal, who has limited the FFP to this idea, is very difficult to pay for a fine of 10 million euros for Medel.
The black-whites are likely to be stranded into Medell by means of a search, such as Canner Erkin's transfer, or a serious transfer to the bonserv.

Human rights have been issued a travel notice for the Missouri group
A warning was issued on the grounds of the state's separate policies and terrorist attacks on the people who travel to Missouri.
The Group notes: "Missouri's state of travel from 28 August 2017 to the NaaCP Travel Council has given special attention to the fact that the African-American travelers, visitors and the Missouris have been on the move in recent times, as indicated there, and that they are on their way to the end of the country, and that they are doing their best at the last possible course of action."
NAACP; a new Missouri law has made it difficult for people to obtain divorce cases, and at the same time, the country's legal implementations have been aimed at making errors without delay, and the group has been involved in publishing this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations.
They stop because of the color of their bodies, they fight and they kill."
"We hear complaints where we haven't heard before."
This is the first time such a warning has been issued to a U.S. state.
The group showed examples of the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man in Tennessee, who was a black man and a black man at the University of Missouri.
At the beginning of this year, Sanders was taken into custody by the Missouri police and died under suspicious conditions.
In addition to the advice given by the Head of State, Missouri is paying attention to a new report that shows that more is likely to be stopped in 75 percent of the country's whites.
Chapel said, "The advice is to alert people to wake up and to warn their families, friends and workmates that they might be in Missouri."
"Let people bring money together, let them know what they're going to get out of this country."
In Missouri, the latest number of hate crimes reported by the FBI was 100 hate crimes committed in 2015 and the country's number of similar crimes is estimated to be 16 in the country.
The travel warning is based on a new Misouri law, which makes it more difficult to handle a business, a business, or a business separation.
Previously, for the U.S. Civil Liberties Unit (ACLU) Texas and Arizona, the country's travel advice was published after it ordered that the local executive agencies of these countries be arrested by the immigration authorities; ACLU says it will increase their applications accordingly.
Travel warnings are generally published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, protection groups have been able to apply this to a set of laws and disciplines within the United States.
Double-declining depreciation [d]
Two weeks ago, the Chinese team transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros to Dumba Ba, which was called to the North-West, without delay."
Kara Kartal, who asked for a health report last week from the Senegalese player, moved after the report from the star football team.
The shadow-white administration, which started working for a 32-year-old player who didn't think of the Chinese representative next season, stole the Shanghai team's door.
Couldn't write to list
Damba Ba, who is not listed as a foreign state in China, sent me to the administration that she wanted to return to the Black-Brights.
The Chinese team allowed the 32 - year - old player to leave.
It's expected that the Senegalese football player will arrive in Turkey in the days ahead.
Castillo was treated in Trabzonspor
In an address on the website of the Bordo-Mávili club, Castillo, described as having performed an artroscopic menu operation on the left side of the Istanbul Liv Hospital, said, "Prof. Dr. Gühr Rights is expected to begin with a group of coaches within 4 weeks."
Castillo, in the Slovak camp of the Bordo-Mavili team, was driven from the right-hand side by the team of Heerenveen and the team in the Netherlands.
It was decided that the Colombian player, who would stay away from 3-4 weeks for the purpose of tedavia, should also be treated for the problem of the previous manic problem.
Get out of Barzan!
Barzani, the terrorist terrorist attack on the Ezidals in the heart of DEAS, carried out a speech at the memorial hall of Duhok during the 3rd anniversary of the 3rd anniversary of the attack on the Ezidals in the heart of the city of Sincar.
In his speech, Barzani, who was referring to the independence that the IKBY wanted to set up on 25th July, said, "I have to say this with regret, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and just country."
We tried all our ways with Iraq, but we were desperate and desperate.
The past experiences we have lived with Iraq have brought us into this situation, and we have no guarantee that we will be able to defend our rights.
That's why we need to show that we can build our entire world through our reference to a reference to life and security.
I need to draw the bottom of that, and the reference is not a goal for us, but a tool to achieve a greater goal.
After Bas Rejimi disappeared in 2003, he said that Barzani, who remembered that the Iraqi Central Government had made many promises to Kurtt, wanted to bring the disaster in Sincar before long, saying that I had decided to refer directly to DEACH after the battle.
BRAZAN, who wanted the KIBY's people to take a stand for self-defence and development and who wanted to establish their destiny in a democratic manner, said, "It has become clear to us that Iraq does not want to protect us or protect us as a government."
"He doesn't want us to move on."
During the terrorist attacks with DEAS, the Iraqi Central Government did not give them weapons but recorded Barzani, who, in a short period of time, had set up a party that had recently been set up with Shabi's immediate deployment and that all weapons had been provided:
In Iraq's defence system, Pehmerge was not captured.
The central government didn't make her move to Shabbi to the Pashmerge.
Pashmerge, according to his mother, is recognized as part of Iraq's defence system.
But when Shaby's mother didn't exist, all the possibilities were repeated with the leaves on the tree.
We're not saying we're against Shabi now.
Pashmerge and Hasidi Shabi fought at the same time, and why, when Hashidi Shabi were destroyed, the Pashmergen's existence and the terrorist struggle were fought.
These are our deepest wounds with the Beneficent God.
The terrorist attack on the Ezidals, who lived in the Sincar Valley of Musul on August 3, 2014, killed many of the people between women and children.
He's been back from the scene in 10 minutes.
According to a news report in BBC, Boeing 777 types of aircraft were on the planes of North Korea, along with Hokkaido in northern Japan.
The experts from the record that the plane fell to the area 10 minutes ago, recorded that it was predicted that the plane was approaching 100-150 miles [100-150 km].
In an explanation made by Air France, it was recorded that the plane did not cross the plane and that the word was not a problem in flight.
He explained, "The information we have at this stage shows that the plane of the plane falls to the sea more than 100 kilometers away."
Nothing sacred?
Trump's White Saray and now he's the target of Freedom Heykeli.
The most specific sign of the change in dignity is the beginning of the attack on the animals.
The Americans know all of this, and the result is that Saddam Hüseyin's reign in the Firdos Meydanda in Baghdad in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of CNN's key players, knew exactly what he was doing when he destroyed the Freedom Heykeli in a symbolic form in an amazing deal with another person, Jim Acosta, who was one of the prisoners in the Trump region.
If it was to be fair, Miller didn't attack himself.
If he did so, the owner of a full ship and the freer would have bound him.
But he attacked his master, and in particular, 17 years after he was completed in 1903, after Emma Lazarus was added to the famous gold medal.
Miller, when he comes out to Acosta, he says, "I don't want to talk about history here from the beginning, but the Freedom of the World... is a symbol of the world's freedom of America.
What you say is added later, and it is not part of the original Freedom House."
Miller's really right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This seems to be because Lazarus's exaggerating words are called upon, not just some old immigrants, but the poor and the poor: "The rich, the poor, the disabled, the disabled, the oppressed, the oppressed, the oppressed, the oppressed, and the oppressed. "
There's never been a time like this in our "unsatisfied" screens.
Miller didn't bring a copy of the book; it explained that the people didn't like Trump in the U.S.
This is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it's actually a conflict with America's capital.
After Lazarus and his death, his friends were well aware that his campaign to put his words on the wall of the grave had taken a very political step.
Heykel, France, and the United States were about to print the connections between the family and the community, and he was about to celebrate the birth of a woman in the form of Freedom.
Lazarus had changed his mind: The woman’s mind was no longer blind, and there was a voice.
And he has a very different name: Mother of the Surrenders.
It's a devastating blow to a feminist and an American move against marriage.
And the doctors wanted to change it for a long time, just as Lazarus had changed his mind.
For the coming of Trump, the great poet, Russian Limbaugh, who was one of Trump's kind, protested in 2010 that he had not invited anyone into the U.S. fire, but that he was an early-war neocon in the dark world, saying, "Ma Freedom is on the rise."
He's got his freedom to move from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to explain the way to the United States of America."
In a way I didn't, Limbaugh actually discovered something.
Heykelin's department was all about opening up.
Lazarus saw this as a marvelous act of creation; he saw it as if it had been seen by people who had been in the ship's storehouses, but who had lost hope, who were far away, and most of them, after a terrible journey.
It was really about seeing the world, the people who called for refuge and who wanted to improve their lives.
His spirit gave them the courage to face the heat of the moment when they needed to hear it.
Of course, this is not a prospect that Miller and Trump will find in any way.
It's not their dream to show the way, but their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black is increasing the British team's Scotch members
Elid Doyle remembers when only two Scotchs were able to join the Great Britain team.
The United Kingdom Atletism Performance Director Neil Black says the 16 people in the World Championship will provide the "crowded wall" team.
The record number-numbered Scotch was selected for London 2017, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that there's something going on in Scotland and that the United Kingdom should learn from this.
Black said, "We're mine, and we're trying to understand it, and we're gonna hit it until we get out of the job."
"I'm talking to people at the Iscoch Sports Institute and they think it's about what they're doing.
The Scottish Atletism thinks it's about what they're doing.
Brittany: He thinks it's about what they're doing.
So is the man in the street.
Whatever the combination of demands is, that's definitely great."
Laura Muir and 5000 m to fight Sir Mo Farah, including Andrew Butchart, for the Battle of Ischoch, and Elid Doyle was selected as the captain of the camp.
"The rest is a little low.
The captain's speech was incredible." "Black.
"No matter where they live or whether they're training, several athletes have come out of that room too proud and really motivated.
I saw Elida's face in a natural way, and it was a truly wonderful feeling."
The fifth World Championship, which will be fought at 400 m in the middle of the World Cup, says "unbelievable" is the 16 Ischoch's team.
The world's best collective athlete number in the past world champions of Iskoshia was the winner in 1983 and 2015.
Five years ago, Brittany and two European reporter Muir leader.
It's going to be 500 m and 5,000 m.
A very good season, including the British Team's trials and the Year's Games, was held by Chris O'Hare, a second Scotch to be monitored in 1500 m.
Doyle, the only one in the team remembers Lee McConnell's first champion.
The captain of the team says that many of his citizens will not only be in the ranks but in some cases fight for the cause of corruption and make it "very proud" to fight the finals.
"To be the captain of the army is to be a specialty that has been given to the other members of the team, and it has already been a great honor, but it has already been a great honor to know that your team friends have played for you and have chosen you."
"I'm obviously proud of all the Scots in my team.
This shows how far we've gone.
And they're here as self-certified pilots, as those who let me out of the podium.
When's the captain talking?
Yeah, I think it's okay.
I've benefited from the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, since there's a World Championship in our house.
I mean, we can't really be able to get back to the Olympic Stadium just because it's the only way we can get through this internship and get back to the Olympic Stadium.
I have a second chance to go out there and fight, and there will be such a wonderful atmosphere."
Disable IMs on Facebook: Do not connect to a public service if you do not want to remove from the selection
Our country's father had a lot of information about getting a place.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long before the newspaper began to make it difficult for him to make it to the political front of politics.
Of course, it's not comfortable with the treatments.
But those who did it did not stop.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed from the midst of us, and we can be thrown away in a foolish and loud manner."
This brings me to Larry Hogan, Maryland's government, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff stopped and deleted at least 450 people who wanted their views on his official Facebook page.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Unit has held him this week.
Valin's staff didn't care if the case was serious, and the conversional cases were filled with "who's in mind?"
Many said, "This is just Facebook."
But that's important.
It's especially important when you're a Hogan.
It's a community choice, which is a wonderful choice in a democratic society.
He has the second highest rank among 50 governments in the country.
Hogan's not a crazy guy.
He showed restraint in taking the lead in his situation and in dealing with the princess.
It was also very difficult to use Facebook as the first tool to connect to their voters, not to fix the hairless head behind the chemotherapy.
So it's dangerous to ignore the people who have an open forum, who are officially designated and paid the people's tax dollars, and who are responsible for their choice by members of the cadre.
In a report with The Washington Post, Hogan's female speaker Amelia Chase defended the results of the election by saying that it would be better to stop their actions than to correct them.
But it's very easy to use the images of the revolutionary attacks by trollers or spammen or haters.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were arrested by Hogan.
And these are only men who speak the truth to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a teacher, a teacher, and a priest, and not a fool.
He said they were all respectful, reasonable, and non-fragile.
Father, in his participation, gave Hogan a copy of the Bible by quoting him as a Catholic.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, was not full of hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
In The Post's report, he wrote, "Naturally, I have done what I've done to his hate crimes and to the rest of the news that I've been disappointed with in the near future."
"I also don't like the idea that when many people are concerned about the same thing, I don't like the idea of seeing myself as a collective effort from a large group of people who are worried about me."
The Valin's staff will probably be called the "compressed spam attack" by others.
The Facebook rotation facilitates the smooth operation of a message by enabling a user to turn on or off an e-mail.
The person's appearance is much cleaner than the ancient days when he was sent to collect and burn newspapers with extra letters or to arrest and arrest Protestants.
But even if it's digital, that's exactly what happened.
Hogan, Facebook and other social media are not the first to be activated.
President Trump was sentenced to trial by Twitter users who were arrested on Twitter.
One of the decisions that might be referred to in the future came from Virginia last week.
According to U.S. Justice James C. Cacheris, the head of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Loudouns, Alexandria, was opposed to the change in the First Mother's position on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Vali Matt Bevin was visited by ACLU for reasons of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, there was a very similar effect on the Internet of the commercial postal service.
Between 1775 and the 1800 ’ s, the number of newspapers increased by four and a half years.
Even then there were trolls that Washington didn't know.
All the people using such names as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belsarius" and "Portius" wrote letters that put Washington's decisions under the feet.
According to George Washington, the translator who collects historical documents, he has established the office of the diocese who has established the status of the British Association for Friendship, Ticaret and Seyrüser Agreement.
But he didn't stop them.
In other words, being a citizen and paying freedom is the most important thing in your country.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes you'll be at the Renaissance Club in peace.
An old European number, Ronan Rafferty, hopes that the house will be in peace during the 25th edition of the Renaissance Club in South Lothan.
In Archerfield Links, the North Ireland, who finally takes the lead in the next door, has a new connection to the region, and is acting as chairman of the tournament for the CEO's Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I've watched the Renaissance Club be built, and we see you're meeting with this organization."
The players will see the stage in a condition best, in the woods.
Jerry set up this place and got a job in the fields.
He's an impostor of this game, and he's proud of the success he's got here.
This is a great show for this area."
Although English Eales and the European Tour won the European Challenge Tour, it will be the first time in 32 years in the career of the European Challenge.
Southport central player said, "This really feels special."
"I didn't have the chance to protect the Extramamara Open because the next year I won was released from my schedule.
It's good to return to this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are alive, and my wife Sharon and I have been very special to win last year.
It was a very special time, and we'll always understand it with love."
Gary Orr, who is involved in the European Senior Tour this year at the beginning of the year, also returns to the game at his own pace.
This organization will be the first Scottish ambassador to Iceland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scotty Open in 2013.
Helensburg man Orr said, "When you fight inside, it always means a little more meaning."
"You want to do good, but you feel too much pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played the basic golf game.
I'm happy to leave until now."
These were included on the site; former Masters Championships Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Championships Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance takes a place between 6 Ischoch on the page; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

All the winner goes to the U.S. Prostate Cancer.
- I found the answer.
Think of it as a "cocket"... but with the 6 billion 867 million Turkish Lira, among them, more than any of the tens of thousands of people who took part in the economics, jobs, energy and natural resources, science and technology, the environment and the arts, health, culture and tourism, and the rest of the world!
Staff number 117,378.
Turkey's biggest propaganda summit!
Yeah, I'm talking about the Management Department!
Yeah, I'll talk about not seeing the Director's Gifts!
It's days... I'm looking for answers to the question in my head...
I'm wondering why he's getting caught up in seeing me.
I read every article about sending.
No, it's not.
I can't find the answer to the problem I'm looking for.
In the beginning of this year...
I don't know, DIB has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the DIB.
It was taken by President Erdoğan to a million lira S 600 model Mercedes.
So he didn't have a problem with Erdoğan.
So what happened?
You might say, "Is it not enough for seven years?"
First DIB President, Mr. Rıfat Börekski, has been in charge for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri, you all know, has been sitting in that chair for 11 years.
I mean... the other's task is open.
I'm going back to my question, "Why did you get away from seeing me?
Got the job...
And the closer you get to him.
Then said he, 'As for him, he has not gone forth in the world, except with knowledge.'
It's the code of this set: it's not a draw!
The guy who used to do this was, "I've found a modernist by means of a global phenomenon!"
I mean, the All-Seer was seeing a journalist.
What does it mean to be young?
The answer to the problem was hidden on a street outside of Mehmet's sight.
Date: 27th of April 2015.
He went to Iran to attend the 29th Weather Conference, which aims to bring Islam closer to its objectives.
Iran's religious leader met with Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
And he kept his prayer with his men of faith.
And he said in the conference, "Major are schools that represent different ideas and canaries in the understanding of Islam."
The purpose of all is to establish a fast for Allah.
Everyone is on a road that leads to his mother's, but they're going to have the same place.
It is never acceptable to compare or compare the content of the poem, or see it on the subject of Islam.
The main purpose is to divide, pass, and merge the puzzle into one, and to divide the puzzle into one.
The worst religion in history has been itself...
I want to re-scan the floor here:
Chileans and Sunshines are the only people...
"No one can deny another because he has not lived up to his senses."
A year later...
The 30th Spring Assembly was attended by only the leaders of the Caferi from Turkey.
I mean...
It's not a coincidence. It's a help.
The speech that Mehmet saw in Iran, and at the conference, led him to the goal of "geneological action."
The next Tahran conference represented the Turkish government - that no one else was involved.
He never saw Mehmet, and he couldn't take four calls since the accident.
The reason was known, in the U.S. D.B., the Iranian opposition to "general action!"
After the Iranian journey, Mehmet Seemez began to be wiped out from the beginning of 2016.
That's what the DIB was responsible for--in fact, Prime Minister Noamun saved it!
I don't know, he was so upset that he wanted to "connect to the DIB Presidency."
It's your job...
There was a difference in the government's view of the Union.
Theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt as a "geneological phenomenon", and the Sunniness - the U.S. island of Vehhabi-Selefic!
These were the Iranians who were not even on the Tahran voyage.
It wasn't surprising to say about the poor Ahmet's charity: "The diamond has not been threatened by this."
"My Lord, make for us a blessed path in the land and in the Paradise of the Everlasting Life."
They used the "all-embracing" as a symbol of Iran's enemy.
Once again, FETÖ's CIA-supported presence in Iran was now running new names.
With the super-FETÖ envelopes...
A picture of a young man who found a whisky in his hand was served by the media with the lie "The Son of a Mercy Not to See"!
Oh, don't worry!
Who did the biggest media interview in Mehmet's view: The Lighthouse of the U.S. Congressional Journal of Turkey!
As a result...
- Your honor, you're not going to bring Suudi Vehhabi-Selefi...
- The one that doesn't load the mesh apart...
Modernist, a religious man, who had been destroyed by a "geneological event" created during the Cold War...
The U.S. cultural imperialism continues to speed up Turkey (to do Vehhabi-Selefi).
You're not afraid that the future Director will be a Vehhabi-Selefi representative!
"We support the protection of Turkey's sovereignty."
He went to China to visit the representative of the Foreign Minister of the United Nations.
President Vang Yi organized a press conference with the People's Republic of China in the state of Beijing.
Vang, "We expect Turkey to be more active in international affairs."
China will support Turkey in its efforts to protect its independence, stability and security.
"We hope that Turkey will be united with the international community that will include the Philippines," he said.
The youth said regarding the Shangya Union of Foreign Affairs, "in the context of close cooperation with Turkey, regional and international partners, the international partners are not an alternative but a complement to one another."
Starts a second time with a spiritual image
The president of Hasan Ruhani, who won the elections in May in Iran, was approved by Ayetullah Hamaney, the country's leader.
Hasan Ruhani, the second president elected in Iran, also vowed that the country's religious leader, Ayetullah, had joined Ali Hamaney.
Turkey's Tahran Major-General, Turkey, participated in Turkey's Rzya Hakan Tekin, because the top-level military and political names were included in the order of foreign representatives.
The Spiritual Day of August 5 will begin after the ceremony of the sworn oath to be held on Friday, which will take place for four more years as the president.
On the other hand, President Nihat Zeybekci, representing Turkey, is expected to be involved.
Security advances in the gate at the gate of the prison
It will not be allowed to pass through the cells that carry material other than gum, medicine, and cleaning materials from the Cilvegös border door in the Royal Valley of Hatay.
According to the information received, the Bel Air Force, located near Turkey's border, has been shut down in the vicinity of the Babylon Airport and the rest of the region as a result of the insecurity of the Cilvegös border, human aid, shelter, medicine and sanitation.
It's allowed to come out of the Cilvegös gate to help out.
No information was provided about how long the word should be restricted.

The house house, in Papua New Guinea's barren area, in the home of Enirotali in Paniai, is generally a sweet patio, generally known as "nota" on fire.
Half an hour later, he's got a broken ear and he's silhouetted in his stomach, or he's not broken.
Degei is sitting on the floor, where he's working on a glass of water from the nearby mud, and he doesn't have a cell phone.
He's looking at an inexhaustible bitch in the house.
He's not given any responsibility when he's at least four of his wife's.
The frequency is here.
Of course, working until late hours can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, many drink too much, and there are soldiers.
He says, "No one goes to the village after 5:00 tonight."
Only a controversial reference to the forced surrender of 1026 years of age to play in general, before the unity was overcome, was the fact that Indonesia was absorbed in 1969 by an ancient Dutch colony in the mountains of Papua, where it was considered to be a daily view of daily life in the mountains of Papua.
In the Netherlands, a campaign against independent propaganda has been sent to the Jakarta government, which protects the region's regular control of the current movement, to protect foreign journalists or to guarantee the rights of surveillance.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua New Guinea as an integral part of Papua New Guinea.

There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes."
"We only used to wear our bodies before."
People living under the poverty limit of 28% and the worst childhood deaths in Asia and the worst in education are Papua, Indonesia's poorest region.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's gold country.
Phoenix Central Freeport McMoran has the world's largest and most expensive gold mine in Grasberg, New Jersey, with a mountainous area of 153,000 people, only 60 miles away from Paniai.
Only in 2015 was Freeport worth 3.1 billion dollars of gold and silver.
In addition, Papua is supposed to have $78 billion in cash.
What is it, these riches, which are a source of disaster for the Papuanians, make Indonesia's mighty army a spoil.
The 2005 survey of New York Times reveals that Freeport's local military personnel and troops paid approximately $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including one subcontracting amount of up to $150,000.
The pope's more autonomic call threatens the golden calf's reputation, and it comes out of their rights without mercy.

The 2016 report "We'll Lose It" of the Brisbane Capital Office contains evidence of illegal acts, violence (in other reports, especially populace and electric traffic) and the public awareness of conflicting displays.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims every week because they're happening." Andreas Harrisono, researcher of Indonesia's Human Rights Survey.
Papua's resources have been increased because Indonesia's resources have been increased.
The 3.5 million population in the region is 83% Christian, but most of Indonesia's islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi are changing with economic goals.

The local people are forced to recapitalize.
"The hunters are selling pigs and pigs in future markets for the local populace," explains Abeth You, 24-year-old of Panai, regional president of Japan.
"That's why the populace and the populace's moms lose their market."
Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, promised that he would solve the secrets and rights issues in Papua in 2014 at the election campaign.
In the early days, while in Jakarta's office, Panaia played 27 of the 29 provinces of Papua.
But there's little change in Papua and the local people feel betrayed today.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we played Jokowi with the expectation that justice will be restored."
In fact, Paniai lived only two months after Jokovi started seeing the team.
A group of 11 children outside the group of 7 April 2014 singing Christmas songs in Enirotali was hit by two Indonesian soldiers on the motorcycle.
Fearful kids told them they had to open their doors.
One of the soldiers got into his arms, and according to Pope Yavedt Tebai, he returned with four soldiers later.
He said the victims and the witnesses who took the evidence of alcohol were fighting the army and hitting their guns with their fingers.
Then one of the soldiers shot the kid's group.
Julianus Yeimo, a 16 - year - old boy, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the government's election commission was set up in a fire and the next day things happened.
Up to 1,000 Papuan men, women and children were gathered to seek justice at a football stadium in front of the local police barracks and military command center.
They wore the regular horse races and played the promising dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (maybe traveling and playing the horse's pass).
Some protesters started throwing rocks at the police and the army.
When the sirens went further, they were sent to the soldiers with their radio broadcasts, "If the majority showed more than three times, kill them."
Jeremias Kayam (56), head of Kego Koto Hospital in Enirotalia, experienced the approaching danger and sought refuge in order to return to the majority.
No one wanted to listen.
"I was shot from one left side when I turned back from my left side," he told Time.
He doesn't know who's still shooting at me, but he says the bullet's coming from a bunch of soldiers.
"It's a disaster, it's a lot of fires."
Alfius You was shot three times, according to a circle of witnesses to the attack.
Like many Indonesians, John, who was known only by the only name, said, "I ran to him, and took his body to make sure that it wasn't."
"I saw him die, I kissed him."
The Pope's Police chief, General Yotje Mende, told the officials that their members were "taken to the underworld" because they were under the attack.
In 2015, the Papuan police spokesman Shube Director Pudjo Sulistio said, "We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with killing us."
"This is the subject of death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of death reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi made a lively conversation three weeks later in Jaapura, where he said he shared the pain of his victims' families and promised to solve the problems of the historical sensitizers in Papua.
He said, "I want this dog to be solved quickly so that it won't happen again."
In October 2016, Mr. Viranto said he had established a non-remarkable mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the riots almost started.
"Most of the works have been long ago.
Some are in the '90s and others at the beginning of the '2000s.
The point is, we have to decide to solve these problems, but there are times we have to go through."
The 5th anniversary of the TIME, Viranto, said that there was no complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They will all be solved by the law."
In 1999, B.M. said Viranto, who had been a victim of more than 1,000 crimes against humanity during North Timor's bloodless play, said that 11 people in Paniai, including the Paniai, had already been killed by a deadly plague.
The families of the panic victims faced this type of suspicion.
"I was invited to meet four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says John.
"I'm old."
She says she's still in fear after years.
"I'm kidding."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, I'm afraid of being shot."
Brother Yacobus repeats his encounter with the people of Paniai who are afraid of discussing the situation.
He says he was attacked by a soldier after he helped four of his victims in hiding.
He says, "After hiding his eyes, the soldier came to call me."
The attacks have not stopped yet.
The next day Paniai's neighbor, Deiyai, fireed the Indonesian police to the village.
With the villagers, a man died during a meeting between a construction company that refused to help a man who did not have the disease, and 17 children among them were injured.
When the fish was caught, Ravianus Doow died while he was in his 24-year-old in a nearby island.
Local villagers organized protests in front of the company's office.
The police said that the villagers were throwing stones to the graves, and that they were showing their way to fire.
But the local people say that the movement police fired fire on the majority and killed someone.
The 29-year-old Domingu Badi TIME, who witnessed the spread of diseases near the hospital, says, "We were very panicked, we were afraid of being caught."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Daily Parliament called for the arrest of members involved in this work and for the removal of the active police force from the area.
Paniai has always become a problem area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful progress, the disillusionment of the peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the mountainous region of the Red Sea.
Many were joined by the Free Papaya Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the innocent and the Indonesian soldiers from torture and torture.
Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya come from Paniai, some top-level OPM leaders.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and taken hostage in recent years by the military under the "Millian Guard".
Some never see again.
Paniai is known among the peoples of Papua as a "trepid and forgotten place".
Poverty is a source of unhappiness.
It's very expensive to buy the little pigeons that are sold in Enorotali.
It's impossible to go.
The people here are making everything they eat -- basically some fruit and vegetables along the bottom of the note.
The work of women who have four or five pairs of sweet potatoes can survive.

Since the opening of new air routes to the island of Papua New Guinea to the Nabire Sea, there has been an increase in economic inequalities between new immigrants.
Things that are less often go to more educated and more wealthy immigrants.
The popes are very proud of their capitals or duties in order to carry out their own tasks as Recipers.
John Gobai, president of the Panai family council, says, "Some people don't hear about staying in the village because there's no job or money here."
Tecrit keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
In addition, national media media restrictions are often imposed.
In the beginning of this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp, despite their permission to film them, were banned from Papua "from the lack of coordination with relevant regulations."
Human Rights Monitoring Example Asia Director Phelim Kine, according to Jokowi, has not been able to remove the restrictions on notification of Jokowi's campaign in order to increase the visibility of the election campaign.
One of his colleagues said, "There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to get into the list of innocent children in Indonesia from Papua and West Papua."
The lack of press control means that the pressure on the Indonesian government is limited to most of Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) urged the Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread practices" in Papua, including Panaia.
The same countries support the OPM as historically.
The Indonesian Foreign Minister, Arrmanatha Nasir, said to journalists in Jakarta, "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and free media, so it's hard for human rights to pass on evidence in their villages."
The local people want the foreign government to take care of more.
A representative delegation from the Netherlands, when the country's human rights apostle Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4th, the local people 'We want freedom' broke their silence by asking him to attend the meeting on May 4.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it's not possible to play Jokowi again.
President Gobai says, "A man with good intentions, Jokowi, is being turned away by people who are opposed to the Panaii attack."
Jokowi wants to know that in addition to living under the threat of the Panaii people's violent soldiers, he wants to know that he has been infected with black education and health services.
Gobai says the Panai people, like other Papualians, have seen their games back to Jokowi as a "bork".
"They don't need money, they just want justice."
Despite threats and threats, Paniai's victims' families took action against the last symbol of a victim's fate, not against the police and the military.
Knowing that Adala can never be replaced will at least make it possible for those responsible to forget the crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus, primarily in the dark.
"What else can we do?"
Yang, Dubai's 'Messale' sky has been opened a second time
In Dubai on Friday, a fire struck the world's highest peaks and forced the hundreds of walls to flee from 79 buildings, which were located at 337 feet [337 m] long.
This is the second great fire that has been poured out to the tallest building that has been called the tower of Meshael in two years.
The building has been emptied, no damage has been reported, and no explanation has been made about the cause of the great fire.
"We used to sleep and wake up to the sound of the blazing fire, and the people were crying out.
We raced down from the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to reach the 50th floor."
Dubai told the civil defence authorities that the team had shut down its huge fire at 4:00 a.m. on the morning of the morning.
The government explained that they were trying to heal anything for the affected.
This event may bring back to the day questions about the security of the material used in the outer parts of high buildings around the world.
The survey conducted by the Board of Directors following the summer of 2015, found that most of the damage was in foreign panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that 80 people died in London believed that the isolation and closing panel system on the Greenfell Valley could be in a state of rapid explosion in the summer months.
'Social Help' for more than 4 chronic patients
The social assistance programme will be launched for families and families who are in a state of chronically ill conditions under the auspices of the Family and Social Politicians, with a first-rate social assistance program of 4 000, 300 tuberculosis and SSPE.
With the help of its programme, the Bank will also provide regular psychosocial support, which is intended to provide support to patients on both sides of the mission.
According to the information provided, the details and application of the "Cronic Diseases and the New Social Assistance Programme" have been identified for some time, with the advice of the Family and Social Policy Officer Fatma Betule Sayan Kaya.
The social assistance programme, which has been launched with the Health Service in conjunction with the work of chronically ill people, has led to the first place in the world in many ways to be of the support of those living in economic and psychological poverty.
The National Social Assistance Programme, which completes all preparations for the launch of the programme, will provide families with more than just shelter and regular psychosocial support.
Thus, the goal is not only to be left alone with poor relatives and relatives who have experienced chronic illness and continue their treatment in their homes.
According to the work done, the first generation will be supported by a psychosocial and prayer program in the pursuit of a new social assistance program for those who are struggling with Subakt Sclerozan Panensefalit (SSPE) who are struggling with a brain disorder that causes tuberculosis and a girl’s microbum.
In the coming stages of the program, there will be help for those who are suffering from other diseases and those who are vulnerable to other diseases.
In addition to the support proposed to be given at the same time on both of the three victims, doctors may make additional payments to health patients who have not gone through their care, who have managed to cope with bed-related illness, or who have experienced the need to improve their home lifestyles.
In order to benefit from the support, it is expected that the military force of the month's military force will be less than three times the net net of the month.
In addition, patients with SSPE need to have a health-care report on the “Individual Size, Classification and Management of Health Reports” published on the basis of methods and health care reports.

Stratos Jet Charters has found that more than 1,000 people are more likely to break the rules of younger travelers.
One hundred of the participants who admit that he's trying to fly with something that he's been able to do by TSA are 19-7 out of Y, and that's why it's 15 out of every X-ray.
The most common substances known to TSA agents will be eaten and cooked.
Over 3 percent of women and 3.7 male partners have also accepted the fact that they have been able to fly with their drug dealers, while acknowledging that more than 3 percent of them are safe.
The company said how many people had run away from the security of the airport, and how many people had run away from it, and how many have done so, to find out that the fugitive did it.
It is not surprising that the most likely people who escape from safety by knowing or not being aware of it are the most flying creatures.
Still, as the company pointed out, the TSA rules are a part of the complex and complex.
Most people don't know how many bones they can carry or how many of them they can carry.
So it's not surprising that the biggest mass of matter in the hands of the TSA is going to go out into the midst of the solid stems.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be able to sell the books as a valuable asset.
It's allowed to fly in the ground, but it's not allowed in the country.
China faced U.S. interpretations
At a press conference organized by President Vang Yi of China, Tillerson's Pyongyang administration, he said, "We are not in a position to reunite the regime, to reunite the regime, and to send our soldiers to the north of the 38th parallel."
China's Foreign Minister Vang, Tillerson's administration of Washington, said that they hoped that the United States' priorities would be re-launched in the form of the US's priorities and that the summit would be implemented in a balanced policy.
Vang, referring to the safety of the Korean side, pointed out that the parties had been concerned about the medium-term solution to the concerns of the parties in the hearing of dialogue, and that the Beijing administration had long been concerned about the reduction of nuclear power, the protection of competition and restoration, the resolution of issues and the resolution of issues.
EPA President Pruitt, Obama Rehabilitation Emission Breakdown Act
One day after being prosecuted by 15 countries, North Korean Prime Minister Scott Pruitt decided to postpone the application of Obama's laws on air pollution which had caused the damage.
Pruitt represented the change to his own property, the needs of the country's environmental editors, that he was more sensitive to the needs of past administrations.
In a federal high court, he never mentioned the prohibition against his previous position.
The country's ground level is the beginning to meet the end of the 2015 standards for the country's ground-level zone.
Pruitt has been informed that he will spend a year in order to make more time for his own resources, to manage his plans, and to avoid "suspending on foreign decisions or preventing economic growth".
Prior to his arrest by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Head of State of Oklahoma, served as a reliable security guard against long-term environmental reforms.
Pruitt has been on the move ever since he came to Washington to prevent or slow down the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's monthly change is the last legal issue for Pruitt's recovery date.
In the past month, a federal high court in Washington, U.S.A., ruled that the ECA administrator, a U.S. government based on an Obama, had tried to reduce and reduce the use of metals by oil and gas companies.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt continued his return to the ozone standards, strengthening the ability to meet new standards in the time of the EPA alone and in the way of complex procedures.
In his first work, Pruitt, who has been conducting EPA more than once, said: "The EPA has been unable to meet the deadlines for the most frequent decisions under the previous administrations, and has been unable to resolve the differences between expectations and decisions for active groups and others."
"We do not believe in the order of punishment, and we take our final dates seriously.
We will certainly take his law and what he gives us."
The EPA's explanation, Pruitt's corrections, indicated that he could once again use "the capacity of improvement and all the other existing legal capacity" to ensure that the reforms are "with sound policies and the best information available".
The Republicans in Congress are printing for a wider revision of the ozone laws.
A Meclis scheme approved last month is trying to improve the application of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
He hasn't been brought to the Senate yet.
President Eric Schneiderman, who took the lead in the coalition of the countries that held the EPA this week, said he intended to press the Group's legal press.
Schneiderman said: "The change in the EPA's decision after our cases is an important achievement for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the crisis in New York and its population."
Davada New York became involved in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Colombia.
Automotives, electrical controllers, oil refineries, chemical tanks and other sources that add sunlight to the atmosphere are brought to the surface at the ground level.
A group of fast-acting people can lead to serious breathing problems, and every year thousands of people die early.
Public health defenders and environmentalists have made remarkable changes in Pruitt's decision.
Lauri Ann Burd, from the Biodiversity Centre, said, "It's comforting to have so much pressure to protect our air from the person responsible for this healthy name."
"We must continue to fight against the ideological struggle against ideologies of the corrupt government, the environmentalists and the ecumenical groups."
Entirely Inflation
In December, Turkey was the largest in 6 years of Iraq, with 13 percent of the unemployment rate declined to 10.5 and the economic security rate rose to 3.5 years, and inflation fell to the same level.
According to data from Turkey's Statistical Framework (TEC), this was the first time that the annual inflation increased by 9.79.
At the lowest level of the main cost groups, the highest percentage of the monthly salary and hotel group were 1.55, and the highest percentage of the group showed a decrease of 3.51.
The largest increase of 15.24 was achieved during the year in the movement group.
In our time, inflation, in comparison with expectations, is the only cause of economic growth, economicist Muammer Kümürcüll, "In the economic perspective of inflation, there is the impact of falling in the prices of ice and clothing groups."
But there's a rise in the last month's height, instead of the topsoil.
He said, "We don't expect the Merche Bank to be a hit."
There was a rise in the incidence of heart rate inflation in the male population.
The Central Bank also increased from 9.07 to 9.46 degrees C to 9.20 to 9.60 degrees.
If Capital FX Research Assistant Enver Erkan states that inflation can be stopped from 9.3 levels in the century, "the rate of inflation can be reduced to one half of the month."
"The Merchez Bank's hand can pass through the first months of 2018."
The President's Assistant Minister Mehmet Shishek: He's going to end the inflation year with the same ghost.
The inflation rate of the Central Bank will continue to rise to 7 percent.
In the recent Guda Committee, we're going to introduce reforms.
Economics President Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation is the only cause of decline in numbers, but it needs to continue to exist.
In the fight against inflation, there must be an increase in the demand for gambling.
Dr. Löffi Elvan: A high rate of annual inflation can be seen in the previous months because of the effect of some of our previous months, but it will be determined by a drop in inflation since the first months of 2018.
We're predicting the annual inflation will rise to the bottom.

Flash Rakka from the ABD: Internal Security Force...
Albay Dillon, associated with the U.S. Defence Department (Pentagon) with the management of the video conference from Baghdad, said that the Rakka Internal Security Force, trained by the coalition, has begun to take place in areas cleansed from DEAS in the city.
Dillon said, "In most of the cleansed areas of the city, the Rakka Internal Security Force, which is a local leader against the Arab and DEAS, continues to prevent the escape or return of terrorists."
Dillon, who said that 230 people had joined the group this week, said that "the number of words of sympathy is 850" was 850.
Dillon, a coalition, indicated that the basic training of the group of weapons was given first aid, arms contact, scan and control points in connection with operations.
Dillon, who realized that the interest in the Internal Security Force was very strong, wrote that the coalition will continue to monitor those who applied for education and will.
The coalition in the U.S. pre-A. is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which created the mother of PYD/PKK in Rakka's adoption.
PYD/PKK was a PKK terrorist known as Leyla Muhammad.
The word is claimed to be PKK/PYD thoughts within the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also learned that he had collected heavy weapons from the al-Karyatheyn (Shuuk) relief group in the southern part of El Tanif camp in southern Syria, where he had spent the last week's support of the U.S. coalition.
Dillon said, "After we met with the leaders last week, Shuuk brought back the heavy weapon and equipment that the coalition had given them, but some small weapons and light weapons were allowed to remain in them."
The U.S. said last week that he supported Shuuk with the need for non-combatant activities outside the areas they had agreed with Russia and that he was in need of support from Shuuk.
The group of DEACH's will is to fight against the Middle East regime.
According to their notes on the phone call, Trump made a press to Mexico on the payment of the restricted wall.
A.D. President Donald Trump, a member of the U.S. Secretary of State, made a note of the telephone meetings between the leaders of Mexico and Australia by Washington Post.
In October, when a telephone meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto, Mexico, Trump insisted on not openly telling the public that he would not pay for the limited wall offered.
The U.S. President of the United States set up a public meeting and said, "You can't tell the press."
Trump began his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the U.S. and promised to pay the project to Mexico.
The notes were also published during the first meeting with President Malcolm Turnbull, who was presenting a remarkable dialogue.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the acquisition of U.S. immigrants to Australia was "massary", "opened" and "aptalca" and offered to the A.B.A., and that it would show itself as a fool under Obama's administration.
Mr. Trump, Mr. Turnbull, said, "It wasn't the nicest talk I've ever had."
He broke the doctor's face.
In Turkey, doctors and staff of the University of Education and Research Hospital in order to ensure that a doctor's friend was killed by the sick, they gave up a short work this morning.
The majority of the patients gathered in front of their mother's entrance to the hospital with the words "no in health" that they carried in their hands.
The hospital's Child Cardiology Clinic Chief Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Pac, "No Health Violence" comes to me as a slave without enough."
There's no place in health, no place for violence.
He said, “If this is the way, the people will not find a healthy wall that will soon serve them.”
The association of health workers Ankara Health Manager Dr. Kamil Türkmen, the First Region of Ankara, the Secretary-General of the Hospitals Prof. Dr. Pöner, the Director-General of the University of Education and Research in Turkey has also supported the patient's proximity to the hospital with Dr. Mustafa Pac.
Pac, who's gonna kill you, said,
It's going to increase the health of those who work hard.
We find a case of this being relived by our brain surgeon at night and by a hospital near a patient.
We ask our people to increase their sensitivity to this matter, even though our government, our economy and our choice is to bring about an immediate end to these events.
I'm sick of what happened yesterday, and I'm sick of my health workers.
If the House takes note of the need for public awareness of health violence, it's like, "Well, now that we're living, it's a kind of complex situation."
He said, "We will take our own traditions, but our people are the most important ones to their own health."
And he said, "Our laws on violence in health are in a way that's very effective."
That's what the government's orders are for.
He's working for security right now.
In the past, these were always empty, but now it's really a crime, and the government is responsible, and it's tracking the case.
He used to say, "There are also examples of severe punishment in this regard."
Those who worked after the explanations continued their work.
According to Idi, the first day of the incident was 17.45.
In my eyes, Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Uzbek, who worked in the Calp and Damar Cerrahi section, was attacked by the victim's relatives who lost his life.
The police were called to the hospital by the doctors and the assistants.
The attackers were caught at the scene while Uzbek's face was cut off.
One of the witnesses, a doctor said:
When our friend went to the hospital’s neighbors to report the state of a terminally ill person’s life, he arrested our friend from the hospital and took us in charge and attacked our two friends.
Our friend's face was broken, he was in the blood.
Then we took our friend into the office and hid him.
He's been in security for 15-20 minutes between us.

YPG rain in Syria...
ABD Virtually Played
According to AA's knowledge of local sources, YPG terrorists, with the support of the U.S. military, in the northern part of Rakka, who fought in conflict with the US, did not attack the homes of the residents of Tel Semin.
The habit of untidy and hand-cooked killers turned into a terrorist attack.
In addition, U.S. troops and armed forces in the region were identified.
The "Cougar MRAP" types were found to create a buffer area in the memory of the Hussein type identification tools.
The terror virus YPG does not allow the virus that escapes death in Rakka, which has been taken under DEAS surgery, to enter the limits of its control.
The local activist network, "Suddenly shared," reported that 121 civilians were killed in the fire of a terrorist attack only yesterday, in December.
Let's not move the wars of the old world tomorrow
Earth and the world's short-lived reality, not just people, can cause the country to run into crises.
One of the reasons why the rest of the Earth's back is that it may be caused by certain rooms to be blocked by or in a way that is true.
Don Kishot and Oblomov have also been involved in accepting the facts and making changes or not taking them into account in the literature world.
Cervantes's "Don Kishot" is still a bird-guarantee.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov" was a foundation that he believed would last for everything as a tool when he didn't see the truth.
China's example, for example, is a country that is open to the end of the 15th century, and it's a country that is going through the seas, and it's closed to the end of a pregnant woman's marriage.
This situation has been halted until the captain of the ships that came out of China's waters.
If we found one foot, eye and ear in the West, the other foot, eye and ear in the North, we've been able to make the truth and change ever since Osmanly.
We tried to move to today on the day of our old and new part, to understand today's tomorrow with the old-fashioned grunts.
And for one part of us, we could not move the earth and the truth, as well as the changing world, as well as the minds of the developed countries.
This situation is a source of constant conflict, of tension.
Medrese was responsible for a dramatic internalisation of the university, a modern army and a modern army, a team of believers, and a dramatic intuition.
And the preferment was worse and worse, and the new and future positions were not accepted at the end of a given period.
After a few days, the leaders of the day began to promote what was new and what was going on, "Cheaply" the Earth and the world's journeys, in a daily way, to "Hain."
The most important lesson in Osmanly is that in the end, the idea of the earth and the world of the truth has been shared by imperialism, and the people have lost their lives.
The most important lesson that our Osman history has brought to the Society is that the rapid acceptance of the world's cohesion and change is an inevitable prerequisite for staying awake.
Because this was a very good lesson, we could be a model country of this planet that has been able to protect its unity from World War I to this day, its whole and its history.
We also need to leave our horses behind and act in harmony with the facts so that we can adjust the global change process that has entered into it.
In other words, no one will be left here to carry the unreasonably campaign and blood cases that have caused our democracy to be collected in the past.
The smallest mistakes in today's world are the major and dramatic crises.
That's the most difficult puzzle we've ever had in us.
History-based end-of-file operation
In the statement made by the Ombudsman, it was stated that history had been carried out in connection with the operations of the Il Jandarma Commandant.
"As a result of the work done, with 2 suspects, two gold coins, a standard gold coin, 20 standard bronze coins, 1 standard gold coins, 2 standard bronze coins, 1 standard gold coins, 1 standard bronze coins, 1 standard metal plates, 8 standard steel objects, 1 standard blue-white stone objects, 1 standard image frame, 23 standard printing and different colors, 4 standard silver metal objects, 6 standard sheets, and 6 sheets of paper paper, and some pages of the Arabic text of the Qur'an are valued as precious, and 1 sheet of paper of paper, 1 sheet of paper and paper of paper of paper of paper, 1 sheet of paper of paper of paper and paper of paper of paper of paper of paper and paper of paper of paper of paper of paper of paper and paper of paper of paper of paper of paper of paper of paper and paper of paper of paper of paper of paper of paper.
It was said, "We will continue our operations in the fight against crime and crime for the sake of peace and security."
Turkish keymap
The world governments that are confident of Turkey's future have fought the war against the nuclear power plant that is currently in effect.
The global record was broken by a model that saved energy by reducing the external dependence of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
I'm going to spend $1 billion on Turkey's energy resources, and it's a way of getting closer to 4 more.
As of 2019, local forms of paint will be incorporated into the system.
The eight Consulates of the United States, China, Germany and Denmark were included among the renewable resources areas (YEKA) launched by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
On the other hand, financial tenders were opened in order to identify the 5 bidders who offered the lowest bidder first.
The lowest bid was $4.19 per kilowatt time after the first bids.
The amount of free space on the left is 0.01 cent.
After the strike began, Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Sevion and Vestas decided to openly eliminate the participation groups that took place in the joint ventures.
The groups that took place in Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang were fighting in the open field.
After Nordex's Consulate was removed, the MingYang-First Building and Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon became the last two.
MingYang-First Building took 11 times.
Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon Energy Consortium has never been used.
Energy and Natural Resources Baseline: Day of record for Turkey.
I've continued 30 rounds of open discharge.
It's possible that there's a gap between the two consoles, and it's like $3.48, cent/ kilowattate, which offers the lowest bid for Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon.
When the Consortium offered $3.49 cents/kilvat-time, the Müstsetscharian Assistant, Alparslan Bayraktar, requested the Commission's request at 3.48.
For two hours, the YEKA was the result of a world record in Turkey.
The average bid was $3.48 per cent in the world's lowest number in the world.
The previous record was in Mexico with $3.84 per cent.
After the outcome of Ireland's press conference, Mr. Berat Albarak, President of the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, pointed out that the struggle is an important message for the region and the world of the German company Siemens, "I believe that when we look at Turkey and Germany's 200 years of historical cooperation, this outcome will be an important part of Turkey-Germany's relations."
Our goals are big.
Today's net economy and the energy market have focused on how healthy and secure the future is.
Despite the regional crises in the world, I was proud to hear that Turkey's region and the world's most reliable economies are coming to bear witness to this fact.
"All of Turkey, in this picture we will be proud of as 80 million, the largest part, the 15-year-old leader and leadership, our leader, who has brought Turkey to this point."
Albirak, who said that he started a new revolution, despite the fact that he was a chef and a goat, said: "One of the most important steps of this is to make a living in the world at 10.3 per cent of the kilowatt worth of $10 per kilowatt, with a historical record of $3.48 per cent, with a world record price."
I am proud of this, for my people's sake, for my country's sake.
Ms. Albyrak, pointing out that the first local production panels in the solar energy are intended to take a turn in 2018 before the end of 2018, he said, "We will include our local production types into the system by January 2019."
The tunnels will be installed in five designated areas.
The company that won the competition will receive at least 50 megabyte power in each of these five regions, with a total of thousands of megabytes.
Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Group will be on $1 billion.
With the entry into operation of local gas power plants, at least 3 billion kilowatts of electricity will be produced each year, and about 1.1 million home electricity will be needed annually.
The average emission rate of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/e will also have been achieved in the case of fluorinated greenhouse gases to be installed.
The company that won the competition will invest 100 million dollars in the factory.
At least 2.3 megavats in the factory will produce 300 or 450 local colouring systems.
The Consortium, Kant, Genener Design, Material Technology and Production Technologies, Software and News Box will be working on Ar-Ge for at least three years.
Each year, 5 million dollars for the work of Ar-Ge will be spent on 50 technical personnel from 80 percent of local engineers.
The factory will be installed 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's license period is 30 years.
At my winning concert, the Turkish Regional Building Director of the Construction Board, Mr. Türker, announced that the project would be in 64 percent of the country's origin, and in 35 percent of the team would be out of the country, saying, "We plan to save the funds of the teams from foreign sources and the rest of the rest from local banks."
Turker said the economy's confidence in Turkey's economy has grown.
Kalyon Holding Energy Group President Murtaza Father, "It has become an opportunity to reduce Turkey's external dependence on thousands of megavats."
He said, "We're happy with the result."
Siemens Gamesa of Turkey told us that he had been active in Turkey for 160 years, saying, "We will do what we can to reduce the cost of electricity."
The factory will have at least 65 percent of the locality of the dye varieties.
There will be 65 per cent of the 8 000 antihistrian particles in the line shape (at least 5,200 pieces).
In each of the 5 regions, at least 50 MW, a total of 1000 MW will be built.
3.750 people want 10 years of Ar-Ge's worth of $5 million per year will be allocated to Ar-Ge's operations.
1.000MW Radial test %65 Local space at least 2.3 MWe produces 300 or 450 standard local paint type.
I'm going to invest on $1 billion a year in 400 MW/year-old rice production capacity, I'm going to invest in a factory over 100 million dollars.
About 1.1 million homes will meet the needs of electricity production every year at least 3 billion kWh electricity production average 1.5 million tonnes of CO2/mission.
Moore's Ford Category: Activists Adalate Call Reinforced the Initiation Link Event
In 1948 a model for Ford Mercuriy was passed between a group of observers in the area of Monroe Georgia and moved directly to the small Ford Köprüs in Moore.
A car with four black passengers and a white driver was set up to stop a group of armed white men before they reached the bridge.
He took a long breath from the head of a man in the middle of a middle-aged dog-dresser, and looked at the inside of it carefully.
In it, those sitting there were terrified.
"That's what we want, Roger."
"Get him out of here!"
A young black man was running from his front porch, and the screams were ringing in the dark.
Well, don't just re-sign this show in the 22nd century.
But when a science was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the monitors gave a very real answer.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to the Ford Bridge in Moore, where they are re-introduced to reorganize the links between Roger and Dorothy Malcom (with George and Mae Murray Dorsey) in 1946 by Ku Klux Klan.
So far, no one has been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reorganization, said, "We see them in our communities, and we know who they are, and we don't realize that for all these years only one person has been arrested."
"It's a story, but it's a burden in our minds."
At 71 years of age, Brooks, an old member of the Congress and life-long human rights defender of the state of Georgia.
This reorganization, a dramatic action call, and an annual reminder of an injustice that has never been corrected in Monroe's community.
He said, “We want to drive, and we want the result, and we want the harm to be done, and we want to go away, but we must be the first to get justice.”
"We can't have until we have the right to receive the benefits and benefits."
The Adli tab is wearing a hat on the corpse of one of the victims of Ford's line in Moore on December 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files produced by the NBC News, more than 50 men were suspicious of Monroe and the surrounding areas.
But one of them has never been questioned.
Though the suspects have been a fugitive for ten years, human rights defenders and lawyers say that the two motivations of the lions are always very well known everywhere in the city: politics and sex.
In June 1946, a Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia was allowed to vote at the end of that letter.
According to the FBI, black partner Roger Malcom, who had a white land belonging to Barnett Hester at the time of a war, was shot as a woman at the same time.
Brooks, the mayor's lawyer said that Hester was sleeping with Dorothy's wife and that the baby she was carrying was not his husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 November 1946, Loy Harrison, who had a white farm, paid $600 to get Malcom out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins went to the George Dorsey prison with Mae Murray.
But when they came to Ford Köprüs, in Moore, on the way from the prison, a left side of the car buried around.
A FBI report says, "It's understood that Harrison was the one who ordered the murders."
"It is also evident that there has been a secret agreement between the State and the local authorities that they did not take the place of the murder, destroyed the evidence, and hid the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks is shorter and he's told himself.
He said, “This is a she-camel. It was my right to give birth.”
All of them were killed to send a message to the foreign people in this town. They said, "If you record it and pay the alms, then that will be for you."
About ten years ago, Cassandra Greene, who takes over every year, manages to re-live the lines of Ford Köprüs in Moore.
The performance highlights all the details, draws attention, and puts many of them in deep awe that they no longer exist in America.
It's hard to track, and it's even harder to turn your eyes, but Greene says it's the goal.
He said, "We don't want to talk about Linci, because that's what leads us all into trouble."
"If you don't listen to me, or if you don't listen to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
This year's trial began, and on the first day of the 30th day, a nearby actor (one on the white and the other on the left) arrived in a room, and they listened when they wanted to enter the general line of the well-tested Greene game.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant manager of Greene.
For years, President Clansman has played his role, but he says that his role is never easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel excited because it's not me."
"I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back then."
The players playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester around the room were testing Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona.
Malcom's wife, Dorothy's been so obsessed with being married to Hester, and she's playing with her husband.
I said, "Z., get out of my house!"
Rascona's giving up.
There's a shot.
And then everyone's in the kitchen.
Most of Greene's laughing.
Rascona says, "No?" she asks.
He was nervous, he was surprised.
Did I hurt so much?
Greene said, "No."
"I just don't think the white people said the z."
One of the other players said, "Yes."
"You have to press 'R."
So it changes the energy in the room and takes place in some kind of environmental pollution.
Everyone's supposed to do this right, not just for the sake of the game, but for the four people who were killed at the same time.
The stage's starting again.
This time Rascona's word starts with N, cuts and breaks.
No one certainly laughs.
Once again, the vision ends violently and quickly.
There's noise, gunfire, and then there's silence.
A woman on the funeral list is standing on the body of actors and reading Billie Holiday's comic book "Garip Meyva".
In both words, the voice breaks.
A hundred yards away from the eyes and eyes of a group of four viewers.
It's almost the same level as being a observer of black and white.
A couple of people came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance.
Brooks took them to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys, and they all stopped Georgia's press service for almost eight hours.
Until this point, the murders had been an anecdotes, but now the link is in the same place as the air is cursed.
When the last notes of her daughter are missing, Greene invites the majority to come near and inject their bodies.
The children are not on their hands, they're bleeding, and they're breaking their bodies, and they're putting them together.
A little boy like he reminds himself, "They're not really dead."
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the majority and ends at once.
The actors throw a nylon and wipe out their eyes.
Bradshaw, the team's playing President Clansman's dress is being dragged to Marbaugh.
Nick Rascona's got two of his playmate's friends, and he's getting old in their hands, and he's coming to him at the end of his performance.
One of the women complains, "It's okay."
"We know that what is in your heart is not that.
You did it for some reason."
And then the monitors, they're sitting on the food with the actors.
On one table, a white couple from Atlanta are talking about a black couple's reorganisation in an amazing way.
Denise Duplinski's performance makes it difficult to find words about how he feels about her.
He said, “These are a horrible thing to hear, a bad thing, and that they have done—they are from people who look like you, and they do it because they are like you.”
"What this has done to me is not to think that the lions have continued," he added, "they're just trying to get shot by the police now."
There's a room in the bedroom eating at Tyrone Brooks' table and talking about human rights.
He said he's been planning his performance for the next year.
He said, “It is a miracle to me that I am still alive, because it explains to us what we are engaged in, but at the same time, it is a teacher.”
"Maybe, if you don't learn from this, it might be again.
Those who have not studied the past, who do not know, have no right to restore it."

AK Party private website to the Congress
By the AK Party, 6.
Installed the "akregreler.com" address website for the collected Congress process.
On the website, the party organization is placed with brochures, material and visuals that will be used during this period.
The rules to be applied in the context of the site's Communication Strategy are set at 14 chapters.
The Head of State and the General President of the AK Party, who took the message on the Internet, were advised to comply with the organizational opinions of the party during the congress.
In the Early Message, "Now we're starting to turn a new launch."
We need to be renewed and updated to achieve the 2023 goals.
"We have to keep working tomorrow as it is tomorrow," he said.
Pearson has done more than 3,000 jobs to reorganize the operation.
The British study group Pearson said that when he started a new program to build on the prints that were face-to-face, he would do more on Friday than 3,000 jobs and reduce his average wage by 72 percent.
According to Chief Manager John Fallon, most of the results are due by the end of 2018 and by 2019, more than 4,000 jobs will be lost when they are reimbursed.
In May, Pearson launched a plan to re-establish the work that had been done in order to learn digitally with a third currency reduction programme, which would re-establish 300 million pounds (394 million U.S.).
Penguin Random House, a company that agreed to sell a month ago to Bertelsmann, said that there was no change in the outlook of this year after the first half of its basic sales amounted to more than 1 billion pounds.
Text 2 is dead again!
According to the first report of the Wisest Class, Hakan's first finding in the premier autopsy report leads to death.
In the detailed investigation, there was no evidence of any injury and injury in the child’s body.
So the heat of the electric band that hits the bottom is the result is the breathless breathless.
The family has been identified as a member of the family, and it has been identified as an electric band used in injuries.
According to the Newspaper of Islam, after a detailed report on the death of the child was prepared, it was learned that the Supreme Council would be sent to the press to investigate the incident.
When the police examine the child's integrity with all the details, they're also running the intruders on the computer they're talking about later.
The police's friends, Hakan, have been designated to follow the statement.
It's also said that Hakan can access third-persons or a field with information from a computer that says "Cleaned" their neighbors.
The police appreciate that Hakan can be driven by a trap.
Hakan's triumphal victory turned his eyes into Textin2.
In 2009, a 13-year-old "minik hacker" of the 13-year-old "Minky hacker" was killed in the last year of Antalia Valiggio.
To play Text2 designed in Korea in 2005 you need to go into the site and sign a membership record.
Players are trying to keep integrity and justice in the world with the great god in the game.
As we do this, there are wars, violence is increasing.
The game also takes place on the side of the scenes of war made by wild animals, such as lions, lions, whales, whales, and wild beasts.
The player buys money for power.
After the incident at the home of Köknar Sokak, Esenyört University, the family who gave their children to the farm the next day, followed the incident in the home of Köknar Sokak.
Father Mehmet Ekinci said, "We don't think he's gonna hurt himself or anyone else because of the game," he said, "They've thrown my shirt over his head and threw it on the side."
That's how it was, son.
We definitely don't think that our son can hurt himself or anyone else because of a game on the Internet.
We knew you were playing such a game.
It wasn't a game of magic playing.
Let's say he left some blood out of the game.
Mother Glizar's Equinci is "no way into me."
It's said my child went home for an hour.
He does not hold any of them back.
When his brother came home, he had the only chair.
He said, "But when the funeral was held, there were two tables with the computer."
First time: It may have stuck to the left
Families usually don't care about this.
They're looking at "Whatever happens at my child's house."
Kids, through games, they communicate with a lot of people.
There may have been some sort of debt payment or denial.
Or he invited someone in the game home, and there may have been a problem between them.
It may have been because of problems with other people, not because of direct play, but because of problems with other people.
The reality of the game may have been that the boy really thought of his stupidity.
The traffic jam that's driving in India may be related to the crash.
If the child is faced with a family crisis, there is a driving condition so he can't solve the problem.
The game won't be over by itself.
It's also a possible word to hit the child.
Maybe he's stuck to the left.
There's nothing that a child can do on his own physically.
Communication information systems: Family members should know how their children are affected
We can't say the games are hurt.
Research has also shown that games are useful for children's development.
The important thing is to watch what parents and children are playing and how they talk to players online.
Families should know how their children are affected by what they are doing.
In Turkey, there are only two kids in five documents who said he was dead from the game.
And this shows that the end of a child's life is not just the effect of games.
What did this kid have to do with this?
We need to know that first.
You need to look at sociology and psychology around the child.
Borsa stopped in Istanbul for 8 months.
BIST continued its rise trend, starting in mid-2016 in December and carried it up to 8 months above.
So this is the first time this year since December 2007, when it's been recorded for the first time in 8 months, it won 45.3 in this period.
From the beginning of this year, Germany, the United States, England, and Japan have not abandoned leadership in the 100th anniversary of the beginning of this year.
The BIST 100 index, completed by 7.06 a year, was 2,54 percent of the U.S. Dow Jones index, followed by FTSE 100 in England by 0.81 percent.
In Germany, with DAX index in Japan, Nikki's index was completed with a loss of monthly value.
The BIST 100 and the world’s leading debt and the developing country’s debt were highly performance when it was measured.
This year, according to the 2016 census, the BIST 100 index, the Daw Jones index, the DAX index, the DAX index, the 4,55 degree index, the Nike index, the FTSE 100 index, the BIST 100 index, the BIST 100 Index, the Daw Jones Index, the DAX Index, the DAX Index 4.55, the Nike Index, and the FTSE 100 Index.
The MSCI EM index for the debt of developing countries was 23%.
BIST was shown to show similar performances in the past when looking at the historical period of the 100th century BIST.
By the end of December 2006, over 8 months between December 2007 and above, BIST 100 in this period had recorded an increase of 38.3 per cent.
BIST 100 in August 1996 was also completed on the 8th of March 1997 and on the 9th of May 1997 by Ocak in 1998.
In his statement to the A.A. Director of Mekselem Research, Erren Can Ummüt, he indicated that BIST 100 led to an 8-month increase, and that the increase was still 37 percent higher in the year.
In fact, the MSCI development market (EM) has recorded 23 percent of the growth rate, and only when we look at these events, it's a positive difference:
This has continued to happen to developing countries since the beginning of the year.
In particular, the funds within the high-level partnership are preferable to countries with higher levels of education.
In this case, the internal market is positive.
Of course, global risk management is also high.
In this case, the sense of the document contained in the risk status of possession is a record of the indexes.
In the U.S., we see that the new record levels have been tested by almost every week in parallel with the increase of S&P 500 in the United States, which is still about 11 percent.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Central Bank (Fed) reported that 3 percent of the U.S. budgets put stress on it but that Fed's leadership policy was very well used to eliminate the uncertainty, and that Fed's tax increase was not felt at all.
The government also stated that inflation in the U.S. has not yet been in demand, and that the expectations of Fed's slowing down and avoiding radical trends are very important in existing purchases.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who said that the U.S. Health Reform known as "Obamacare", has strengthened the commitment that the broader monetary policy will not replace the promises, "the faster the higher the U.S. economic expectations in Trump, the faster it becomes to realize that the US economy will have a reverse effect on the purchase of documents, the faster it will become and the faster it will be given to inflation."
The U.S. said that Turkey's sales revealed that it was a year after 2016 that there was a lot of uncertainty, according to BIST 100, which was negative and oversaled.
The State, which stated that they did not see a strong collection of information with internal sources of information, noted that the presence of the present appearance could be affected by the rise in the risk-taking business outside the country, according to the differences between the internal market and the demand for closure.
The United Nations, with 108,600 levels technically tested for new records, recorded the following in the BIST 100 index:
In particular, 109,500-110,000 districts are short-lived, critical clothes.
After approaching these levels, it's normal to make fair sales.
We think that in a short term, there must be a local or global new story for payments to be made.
Now, 107,500 supports can be encouraged by the low price sales.
In this case, I think if we follow the 107,000 call support, we're going to be able to see the slope up to 106,000-105,500.
In particular, the interruption of 105,500 supports can lead to a reduction of up to 104,300 levels, which will increase to 50 percent of the peaks of 108,600 levels.
Hem Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) have stated that the decisions will be at the end of the global market, but Fed is now aware of the expectations of the government only now expected to increase interest in the current FOMC, and the possibility of a reduction in the balance sheet could be encouraged to be strengthened in the United States.
Suppose that this situation could lead to expensive sales in the developing country (ECU) in the short term, which is in the short term, "what the ECB will say is important if it is important to do so."
After the final meeting of the ECB's monetary policy organization, President Mario Draghi wanted to discuss his policy tomorrow, which led to the rise of 1,1700 levels of the arro/dollar parity.
As a result, the related explanations will be reduced or concluded by the ECB in the following global scale, which will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Turkey, with its request, offers can be made in the name of countries that offer high prices such as Turkey and which need access to the external market."
Former Investment Investment Dialogue Manager Erol Gürcan also pointed out that after the presidential election of Trump in the United States in November 2016, global media has played a very important role.
Gürcan, a fundamental element that stimulates this roll-over movement, reported that it is possible to say that there is an increase in global growth expectations for the first tax issue in Trump:
Borsa Istanbul also took place at the top of the world's prizes.
One of the most important reasons for this is to say that the BIST 100 index has been very closely associated with developing countries in recent years, but it is worth noting that the economic and financial measures taken by policy makers have played a significant role.
In particular, we can say that the Kredi Garanti Fonu (KGF) index, which was active in March, has a serious impact on the growth that has so far been observed.
In the last half of the year, Gürcan, who pointed out that positive developments were contributing to important payments and that KGF, which has an important role to play in this increase, has achieved a slow pace, while BIST 100 countries still continue to be symmetrical, although a new approach could be slow forward for the rest of the year's return.
The 180-day action plan, which was expected to share the data for a period of time in particular, stated that the development of companies' wives, such as the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, was carried out in a supportive way, and that progress, such as the sending of daily taxes, would be possible in this sense.
Gürcan, Fed, the ECB, and the United Kingdom (BoE) developed central banks, as well as the slow pace of the slowdown of existing monetary policies, stressing that they are among the risk elements of developing countries, "for a long time, the fact that Fed, who is likely to continue to grow in high-performance tax rates, will have to start with the possibility that the ECB's short-term recovery programme will be completed, and that the possibility of further growth in the developed countries will be beginning in this sense."
Gürcan, who said that the region is highly critical in terms of the region's collapse of the support area, said that it could continue to move to 101,700, 100,000 and 99,200 levels in terms of the improvement of this support region.
Gürcan indicated that, in the case of the maintenance of existing elevations and the collapse of 108,605 directions, which are at present age, the index could rise to 110,000-12,000.
Cable Convoy Attack: NATO Army Killed in Attack
According to the authorities, President Afghan attacked a bomber in Kabil, killed a NATO soldier, and injured a few.
In NATO's statement, five soldiers and a translation were injured.
Unreported local sources say three civilians were killed in the event in the Karabakh region.
The last violent act that took place this month in Afghanistan, and more than 30 people died on the day of the bombing in Herat.
On Tuesday, a fire bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabil.
In NATO's statement, Persebbe was identified as being subjected to "personally motivated hand-extinguishing explosives" in his partnership with the Afghan army at night.
He explained that all wounded were in good condition and were under treatment at the U.S. military hospital in Bagram.
The leaders say Taliban forces are an important source of concern for NATO forces speaking near the Islamic Government (IS) in Karabakh.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians to 20 percent of its capital.
At the end of December, a nuclear bomb killed at least 30 people in most of Kabil's territory in Şi.
The Taliban said they did the rape.
On 31 May, after the United States-led forces withdrew from Taliban in 2001, he killed more than 150 people in the city's city's most deadly military attack.
As a result, U.S. President Donald Trump, a former U.S. military and police officer, is putting an increasing number of U.S. military and police units at stake in Afghanistan.
The leaders say that in recent weeks the government has launched a crisis in trust with the government, its policies and, in particular, the army that is behind President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA refused to renew the air traffic code after the cases
The U.S. Army Environment, an Obama government, has decided to reduce the amount of the damage caused by the State's tax on the issue, and one day the majority of the 15 countries are returning to this entry.
The EPA explained its decision to continue with the "2015 Ozone Decisions" on Tuesday, after hours of work with the developing countries.
"We believe in dialogue with our country's partners and are not sensitive to them," said EPA President Scott Pruitt.
In the month of Puritt’s summer, the EPA announced its intention to postpone its ozone-depleting decisions until October 2018, which are measured at different locations in the country’s present bad weather patterns and is decided where it is necessary to determine where to meet higher air quality standards.
In most of the 15 countries with democracy, a case has been made to state that this effort is not due on the right day.
President Donald Trump's administration is calling for the restoration of the broad-based environmental reforms by former President Barack Obama as part of the broader day-to-day which Trump called for to signal for economic growth.
But these efforts have opened the way for groups of defenders who are concerned about the impact of democracy and more on public health.
The EPA website says that air pollution in the ozone layer "can decrease the functions of the current and increase the symptoms of the solitude as below."
He gave me the good news...
It's in the back of the truck and the canal!
President Fikret Orman, the Dutch footballer Jeremiain Lens and the driver's transfer to bein Sports.
Fikret Orman said that...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
Our goal isn't too much transfer, it's a shot.
Now we're going to make a stopper and canate transfer.
The champions have Ligi games, and we're going to have a good time.
We've got to move the canal of Mecbur.
10 million euros is very easy, but we don't have one.
If it comes to what we say, we'll transfer it, and if we don't do it, we won't die.
I can't give you information about Lens.
We're a public company.
It's not the end of patience.
WAS IT only for August 30th? Is there no festival?
Ankara Valigüi continues to include concerts during August, with the "ISIS threatened" billing, a memorial meeting, and similar collective activities.
It's an expression of "all collective activities" in the written decision of the valley, in Ankara 7.
It's the Big Ankara Festival, by the way.
In his statement to the Chief of the CHP Group and the Ankara Milletvector Levent Heaven, SÖZCÜ, he said, "It is impossible that August 30s should be affected by the laws," and he said:
He's got a serious headache.
Which decision will he make?
It's the government's way of creating areas where the holiday will be celebrated.
The CHP Ankara Milletvekist Murat Emir also said, "All Ankara has security issues, only the organizations of the universe have no security problem."
He moved to the old Meclis.
Nazlyaka, who was encouraged by the President's statement, said, "Don't you think that this is a sign that is clearly the AKP's aggression and Father's enemy? How do you think millions will be prevented from celebrating August 30th?"
"I learned from Edwina that I was changed."
The case of divorce with Abraham Kutluay, Demet Şener, was in Nishanta's first day's lawyer with the Real Hatemi.
Edwina, who claimed to destroy her house, called on Sponza to be a witness to the trial of Shener and Kutluay, who had been involved in the conspiracy.
Socially beautiful Sponza also said, "Demet, he took my special photos illegally," and he heard a crime about Shener.
'I'M BUYING THEM'
After this last development, the lawyer, Sener, who was found in his Delicatessen, came out of the area to see the journalists.
Shener, who was very upset, was reminded that Edwina Sponza's comment about the pictures was "God, I've probably taken it home."
"There's such a complaint, but it's not true."
He said, "Everything is in our hands; we are bound to be judged."
Mr. Schener, the reporters said, "Everyone knew about your wife's relationship with Sponza at the time."
"How did you not know?" he was surprised at the question.
What?
How?
She said, "I swear I didn't know." She said, "Would I believe my husband who looked at my speech, or would I believe in what I said?"
Sheener, who used to say, "No," said, "I didn't say that, of course, I heard the first time."
But I didn't believe anything like that in any way.
Everything was normal, it was in place; I had nothing to doubt.
Ma'am, I learned everything by sending everything to my hands, so...
"Is the man who sent the evidence?" Mr. Schener, who gave the "Yes" answer to the question, said that he was very confused by the pictures and the writings of the court that claimed to be sent to him by Sponza.
Sponza had previously claimed that he had written his essays with Abraham Kutluay.
The deal will be signed tomorrow with Negredo.
The 5th Club, the Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo, will take the picture tomorrow morning.
The Vodafone Park will be scheduled for the Vodafone Park, which is agreed upon in principle with the Valencia Club of Spain.
The signature form of Fikret Orman, also known as the club president, will be carried out at 12 noon.
In the meantime, the Spanish football team will be under control tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke into Turkey for hours in Ambargou
President Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani indicated that he wanted to express his gratitude to the people of Turkey.
Al-Thani said, "I am very grateful for the support you gave us and for the support you gave us."
I'm sending my brother to President Recep Tayyyy and Erdoğan with the greetings of Qatar's Emperor.
He confirmed the rise of the katar economy.
Our economy remains healthy when we have economies in many countries.
We need to work hard to make Qatar independent and strong.
We broke up in a big place in Turkey within hours of the army against us.
We have nothing to be ashamed of right now.
Our natural resources, natural development, were very supportive of Qatar's economy.
We have not been affected by the scourge of cruel treatment and law against Turkey.
Today, Qatar is born again and continues to be born in the world at LNG.
He said, "We've lived a 30-cent increase in our natural culture after the fall."
Al Thani notes that he continued to work in all fields with the relations between Qatar and Turkey, "The first time that the trade became a $554 million priest."
The decisions made in the last days have also played an important role.
The result of identifying Turkey's products in Qatar's market is that it is important for all sectors to speed up the entry of goods from Turkey and to make investments in many areas as far as we are concerned.
He said, "Thank you very much for your efforts against us."
It's 300 million TLs.
TSB President Can Akın Chağlar stated that 116 million TLs were committed to security companies after the 18th press in Temmuz, 12 million litres were taken in the 21st Gökova depressure in Temmuz, and 12 million litres of 800 litres were taken in the 21st temmuz and that on 27th of December, there were 168 million litres of waste in Istanbul, and 168 million litres in the last three cases were found in the last three cases.
They say, "The damage to the damaged vehicle caused by the accident insurance is 3 000 lire, and the damage of cam is within a thousand lira."
He said, "It's the average loss of 6 thousand litres in December."
The Canyon Chaggles, who was attacked as a sector for the supply of economic losses, said that every 4 people had no nuclear security, no fire safety for each of them, and 2 out of every 3 people had no casket insurance, said, "The natural risk of climate change is growing."
Our country's low level of security is increasing the risk of encountering our relatives and our institutions with serious disasters every day.
All these capitals should not be left on state.
It's not as bad as the security police are, it's not just a sector that pays damage; it's talking about risk management at the same time.
The increase in security knowledge and security is very important for our people and for our country.
"The Cassou Security writes that the insurance is usually required to report losses to the insurance authorities within 5 working days, and it's been over this time."
"Will there be a safe fight?" he said, "Even if it's a general situation, it's a two-year period of time in the Ticaret Act."
He said, "Those who have lived here don't have to panic because of the fact that the insurance companies don't have to panic, I don't pay any company."
That's how Germany's media looked!
During a period of increasing tensions between Turkey and Germany, Turkey's first Renewable Energy Energy Areas (YEKA) were taken into account by the German Siemens company.
The German media heard this development saying, "Alman Siemens won the state in Turkey."
DWelle Turkey said, "The Consorium will invest in 1 billion dollars in cash," when the YEKA team announced that Siemens-Türkers-Kalyon won the Siemens-Kalon Consortium.
It was explained that the number of competing companies today rose from 8 to 2 to 2 in terms of the words of Turkey's first JEKA, which was launched to create the capacity of its megastatic electricity, and that the China Mingyang Consortium, which was opposed to the Chinese and German Siemens Consortium, was released when the 30th season began.
After the hearing, the Energy and Natural Resources Commissioner, Berat Albararak, who made an explanation, found himself in a controversial statement on Turkey-Germany relations.
In fact, the German company won Siemens, and we can say that this image is an important message to the world.
And when we look at Turkey and Germany's 200 years of historical cooperation, I think this will result in an important part of Turkey-Germany's relations.
I've heard a great deal about how much regional crises in the world are coming from Turkey and from the most reliable countries in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, seeing a possible guest
For 147 pounds, Vasyl Lomachenko and Mike Garcia met together on the first day of June, when they were about to set up the most exciting boxing game in the near future.
They were in separate rooms in the ESPN offices in Lomachenko, Los Angeles, as well as in the New World Boxing Council.
On Wednesday, in the showtime, the first world champion of four bikes, Adrian Broner, was born after Garcia's youth, and the two combatants were among the best five members of the list that did not watch the bike.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his tomb against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 a.m. in ESPN.
The second, while cleaning up for the photos, the manager of Lomochenko Egis Klimar, recorded that a potential passenger between the combatants would be "inexhaustible size".
Garcia reminded me, "I'm an old skulch."
"I went up to Bronner (140 points) but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go to the lighthouse.
He's got to go through a light cycle of 135 pounds, and then we can fight.
That's what historians want.
We'll give them that."
Lomachenko was involved.
"You have a need for this fight."
The climate asked whether this should be in the 'eating and monitoring'; to set up a next written history with Garcia (37-0, 30 kavt) and to fight Lomachenko in a 135-pound-opening meeting in this year; and to fight against George Linares-Luke Campbell for a mild skeletal address in the Forum on 23 July.
Garcia said, "You can be in the fight 'and watch 'cause all sides want this." And then, which channel offers the best financial package?
We're the main names.
No other name could make such a connection.
"When they're ready..."
Garcia Lomachenko said that he considered him "a warrior" and that he could join him on Saturday.
But Lomachenko, who ran into Garcia from great grief, and thought that the three bikes from Riverside seemed "very slow," said, "Don't worry, Mikey... you wanted the key."
Garcia said he was a boxer after showing his strength in front of the room.
They both said they felt that they were created to meet themselves.
"It's a fight to be done.
Another fight isn't that interesting and it doesn't make sense.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to meet you."
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Turkey from Russia to the United States
White Saray doesn't think of applying measures to affect Moscow's line construction, but the management of Russia can increase the capital of these lines.
That's why it's the increase in debt.
In contrast, Kremlin, who was worried that the joint investment partners would think it'd be pulled out of projects, speeded up the construction of the storm lines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which built the Turkish Airline, planned to reach Turkey under Karadeniz, made rapid progress on the demand of Gazprom.
Reuters also wrote that in order to attract more gas to Europe, the Gazprom also started the construction of a second tower line similar to the Turkish Aquifer.
Switzerland's LITTLE Evaluation Test Opened New Results
In Switzerland, the latest results of the evaluation tests of students based on a new medical evaluation method in Sweden have been ruled by the government that more than 80 percent of those surveyed are over 18 years of age, but not everyone is convinced that these tests are valid.
Switzerland's million-year-old Adli Type and Ilach Dairez (Rätttsmedicilverket) began to do tests earlier this year.
Tests were designed to assess the age of some of the students who claimed that the Swedish Migrationsverket did not qualify for the age of their failure to assess the age of the students.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent out 6880 cases, and Adli Typ and Ilach Dairei has now explained the end of the total of 2481 since March 31st 2017.
The 80th anniversary of the 2002 season was decided on 18 or more, and on 25 May, the trial of the Adali Typ and Ilach Daire was "probably 18 and over."
In 432, the result was that the person was "probably under 18."
The tests were performed only in cases where the person's age was doubtful.
According to Johann Göransson, the results from the Wise Typ and Ilach Dairesie are due to last months.
He said to The Local, "We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, it's very expensive."
It doesn't mean people who have ruled that they're older than 18 years of age are lying about the age of the mayors.
In May, the judge explained the outcome of the 581 test and said that "the persons who have been recruited have shown themselves to be older or older" 442.
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper quoted the results of 581 dogs, he found that 243 dogs clearly claimed to be 18 years old.
The method of medical evaluation of 20-year-old teeth and the treatment of MRI supplements, and later analysis of these for dentists and radiologists, is used in some areas.
One of the hunters, Claude Marcus, who appreciated the biological progress of the people who found their work on it earlier or later.
"I have reasons to think about it, and I think that this is not the kind of measurement used.
It's very doubtful to make decisions in this way of biological life.
If we can't say exactly, we shouldn't do that." said the Metro newspaper.
What's wrong is, you can say, the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult in general is small.
The biggest risk person is under 18 years of age, and in this case, about 10 percent of the risk."
The star of Hamidia is opening up in worship today.
In 1885, the star Hamidie Camisi, which was held in Jelpuylo by Abdullahamit, will be opened in worship today after the restoration of the restaurant.
The District Director Mürssel Sarj said that the restaurant work started in June 2013 was completed and the truck was ready to open.
The show said, "Restoration works were conducted in two camps."
The first part of the truck was the repair of the mother's building.
The second part was the environmental adjustment.
In the first part, about 16 million lira were spent around 11 million lira.
First the doors of the cave were opened, and after they had been repaired, the outer walls were closed, and the doors were closed, and the doors were shut.
It's been done with healing.
There's a lot of rich tips about what we're seeing when we get into the truck.
It's a treasure that has star motivations, and it's a lot of money from what's going on.
There's a karma in here.
"If we were to think it was made in Osmanley and in 1885, the baroque movement would have begun to get underway."
MEDITERRANEAN SEA
"Alman Emperor 2's adage located in the central area of Camino."
There were some errors, it was re-cleaned and replaced.
It's a very valuable and important part.
There's a symmetrical cup of coffee on both sides of the camin.
We know this is made by Abdülhamit Han.
We have the knowledge that he does this by his own hand and that he's mounted here.
They're still standing here as originals.
Sir, President Recep Tayyyyi and Erdoğan are waiting for his participation.
Pantic ID in View
The Ukrainian press wrote that a 25-year-old Serbian footballer who didn't enter the square in Dinoma Kiev could be hired to a red club.
The country of football wore the shape of the Pantic, Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain, beginning with the Red Cross team in Serbia.

West Virginia said she'd change her party.
West Virginia's Democratic Government, Jim Justice Persebbe, said he would change his party with President Trump on a date.
Vali Justice said, "If you don't like it or don't go, the Democrats left me."
"I'm going to tell you today many prayers and thoughts... and I'm going to tell you today as West Virginians, and I can't help you as a Democrat."
Mitting's filled with surprises.
Justice added, "So I'm going to change my record tomorrow as a Communist."
"If I were a technical director, it's time for you to create a different game."
Mr. Trump said he'd make an important announcement earlier in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 pounds, and he didn't support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Court of Justice.
Forbes was elected in 2016, with only one billion members.
Forbes, with his father's help, he's in 5 cases with the aid materials.
It's about $159 billion.
In the meantime, a statement was issued on the night of the International Congress of the Republic of Congo, saying, "It is another job for the Democratic Party to work to prevent the country from expanding its country instead of re-establishing it."
According to RNC woman's speech to Ronna McDaniel CBS, "It's only the last rejection of a party that has not been guided since the beginning by 15 elections and at least a state-run mechanism."
I'll do my best for Turkey
Third Olympics, record to Turkey.
He was born in Cuba, but he appointed Turkey for the F.Bache...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the thousands of shape...
First it became a European champion, then the third Olympic...
Now is one of Turkey's most important hopes at the World Championship of Athletics.
Yasmani Capello, a 400-foot racer, spoke to Sabah before the show started today.
They didn't want you who didn't like their levels in Cuba when they were young.
You've grown up when you've got the coach.
Then they called, but you didn't go.
Some think you chose Turkey for your money.
What are you saying?
The last thing I remember about Cuba, I was separated from the thousands of teams.
I can't say I've taken a line of what I've been living for since then.
Then I came to Turkey with the invitation of the Fenerbach Club.
I joined the Millennium Team, and it was in Fenerbach.
They offered me an offer for the course.
I've opened a new page with Turkey.
I lived very quiet when I was young, but I signed up for important successes in Rio and Amsterdam, after the opportunities I had in Turkey.
I'm impatient to do my best at the World Atlas Championship and win a different dream.
In the past few days, you've been in a press conference.
Can you tell us why?
When I'm asked a question about Turkey's out there, I think my child is coming, and I'm being expelled from the Cuban Millennium Team at the age of 23.
And of course people are coming to me in Turkey.
When I won a gold medal at the European Championship in Amsterdam, I felt something like this when I was playing the Estonian March.
I didn't keep my glasses.
I thank Turkey very much for allowing my dreams to be realized.
I'm so glad you belong to the Turkish Military Team.
I'll be here as long as my legs run.
You told me before you said you could have a love of Turkey.
You're with a Turk now, you're going to Cuba together.
Would you like to share their lives?
The greatest peace to be with a Turk...
It's cool when I compare myself with the poor women...
The Turkish girls have connections.
Your girlfriend's assistant coach at the same time.
You're together all day, for example?
She's more sweet than me.
I don't really mean much, but it's time for me to eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, often finds serious warnings, but I know they're for my good.
How's it going with your Turkish food? Does your favorite make you eat?
The Turkish women are eating very good food, but my love is doing better.
(laughs) It's the first time I've ever been to a funeral.
AS TOLD BY SADECE
The coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He took other young people to my place.
After we won the medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
Looking at my face, he showed me to the young sporter, and he said, "Well, I've grown it."
I was just laughing at him.
PATH TO DEVICE
It's interesting that you're looking at the fights...
I'm just using it for concentration.
When I turn my eyes off, I break my relationship with the world and break my legs.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
WHAT comes to mind when we say "Tokyo" 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
In 2012 London Olympics won a gold medal at the age of 35 in the 400th century.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, you can't.
TURKCELL DESTIC VEHICLES
Turkcell General General Ismail All of them believe Yasmani Capello will succeed in London, saying, "We sincerely believe that Yasmana will represent our flight in the best way."
We're talking about our success in the fight against London.
He said, "We will continue to support the development of Turkey's athleticism and greater achievements in our country."
Coe, Russia's doping scandal's "samimi" is about to happen.
My global athlete's boss Sebastian Coe, the doping scandal that Russia has identified as the state of the doping scandal, pointed out that it is not the right time for the country to re-accept the sport.
Russia's athletic boss, Dmitry Shylahttin, said that he was right to be taken out of the sport by the IAAF Congress, organized by the World Championship, and decided to fight with doping himself.
He said, "I am sorry about all the horses who were forced to take gold and silver in the contests."
In response to his assessment, the IAAF Congress used the game after finding evidence of state-supported doping in Russia by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 2015.
IAAF said to the leaders, "I think it's a very good thing today, and a lot of fun."
"The Council and the Congress were pleased to do everything they could to ensure that the Russian Federation accepted itself, that it had thrown many days of theft, and that the federation had done everything possible to ensure that it was rebuilt."
Coe, Russia, said it was "my" before he accepted his own acceptance of the criteria.
Coe said, "I think it's a very exciting day, and I think it's a road trip, but Congress is in support of the fact that there's no time left to consider Russia's rights."
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The driver always wanted to get rid of the clean jet system."
The next Russian athlete who meets the IAAF criteria will be fighting in the World Atletism Championship in London on Friday.
On the day of the IAF's mandate, Rune Andersen said that Russia has not yet met a lot of criteria for the rights of Russia.
He told the IAAF Council that the drug test was still insufficient and that legitimate coaches were still free after a survey in London.
Don't lie to 'YPG' messages from the ABD
The United States of America has announced that no tank was given to any side of the war in Syria.
And they denied the judgements sent down to YPG by hundreds of thousands of tanks and weapons.
The main explanation of the wrong news about the incident in Syria, which was made by the Apostle, was:
In the last few days, there has been a false report that the U.S. has sent hundreds of tons of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the U.S.
The news is that the basic facts about the situation in Syria are not to be seen.
The U.S. has not given any group of combatants against Deasha in Syria.
The US is primarily supporting the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) in a large part of the aid of light weapons and significant military aid.
The occupied Syrian Arab forces are also fighting to clean up and rebuild their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: The real foreign investment is over the past year
TYDTA, President Arda Ermut, said that 55 percent of all the investments that came last year had come after the month of December 55.
15 Ermöm, who realized that there was no decline in investments because of our entry into the field of FETZ, and that there was an increase in totality, said, "Maybe there would be more, but he didn't."
Maybe if these conditions did not occur, we could see more than the impact of the explosion, if there were no regional developments.
That's why we hope more for the next year.
It's going to be a brighter year in the sense of real investment.
In the first five months, we're going up 11 percent by the first 5 months of the year.
But we don't find that enough.
"We hope there's more." He used his words.
Ermut, who said, "We don't like regional development, if it's possible, but we don't like it," said he, trying to diversify investors.
Ermut went on to say that 75 percent of direct investments by 2010 had come from Europe:
This number fell to 66 percent.
Again, the portion of Asia went from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, some problems arose between the Korfez countries themselves.
Turkey has a good relationship with all, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries upsets us and, in fact, makes investors' decisions a little bit more complicated.
It's not just about investments in Turkey, but we might be living some nights.
Ermut recalled some events in Germany last week, but the government, particularly President Recep Tayyyyip Erdoğan, had shown a positive and positive reaction to this situation.
When talking to investors of countries with the worst political crisis, President Erdoğan's reaction was, "There will be some problems between governments, there will be no certainty among peoples."
The second of these people came and made an investment in my country.
These are no different from the Turkish companies for us.
Instead, they'll come to us when they're the least problems, we'll solve them.
"We shall not let them be swallowed up by it," said Ermut, who said, "that they should not be swallowed up."
Ermut says, "We can guarantee this in our future."
You'll see that neither German companies nor investors from some countries that we're in any political situation will live in any kind of trouble.
Instead, we will do what we can to increase the investments from these countries.
We think the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect the economy's perceptions.
He said, "Oh, we will do what we have done here, and we will do what we can to make our share and not be affected by the share of the economy."
TYDTA President Ermut, after a single road strategy, told him that Turkey was starting to see a great deal about China, but if the problems were solved in Korfez, they would expect the biggest investment from Korfez.
"In relations with Germany, there is no investor who says, 'We have been in distress from these relationships, and we have been in debt because of this incident, and we are running'," said Ermut, who used his words, "we have come, come and follow each other."
Ermut, "The German company's close to 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio right now."
So the companies we've seen around the world are almost 10 percent of German companies.
Some of these are companies that are still investing in Turkey.
A man's going to increase his investment, or he's got a problem, and we're on a project.
"The German companies are still making an important part of our daily work."
He expressed his wish that Ermut, who stressed the need for the attention of all government institutions during the periods during which the initial operations were carried out in Turkey, would be sensitive to the issue and could be affected by the smallest negative communication.
Ermut, pointing out that those who lived in the past 2-3 weeks were a good lesson, said:
It's always different from the politicians' day.
We've always seen this; economic relations always lead to political developments.
Germany will continue to be an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because there's still a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election day in Germany also increases this kind of speech.
I think they're going to get a little bit further.
Saudi Arabia is also paying attention to the fact that two countries have not made negative comments.
A investor who invests in Turkey in netice is making investments in the markets of all the countries around the world.
As a result, Suudi wasn't from Arabia, but there were some slow periods of uncertainty in the region.
But we're still meeting these investors.
My personal experience, the investors may be waiting for a decision they can make faster.
'In a negative sense, I see a crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and I'm out of here,' we don't have a Suudi investor.
On the other hand, we have Suudi investors who have continued to live in Turkey, who have met us on one side while doing the workshop here, and we have been following all the courses.
Ermut, reminding Turkey of 12.3 billion dollars of real investments to the countries of the past year, "I think we're definitely going to spend it this year.
"How far we're going to go, these regional developments, global uncertainties will affect us."
While hoping that there will be more than normal shock effects, perhaps indicating that it might be a little more limited, Ermut, in the first five months of the year, showed that it was increased by 11 percent, and that it could be protected, "If there's no bad development, I believe that the end of this year is definitely better than last year."
He provided information on Ermut, logistics, health, fitness, knowledge, petroleum, gas, energy and waste that would continue to be a major part of the investment that will continue to be a threat to the economy.
Ermut, who's threatening to make new investments in the months to come, says, "Maybe it's an anatomical in the future."
It's not a billion dollars, but I'm a big investment.
"There may be investments from countries if you're willing."
4 wine company operations 9 years: 55 o'clock
The Spanish Anti-Fraud Crimes Boards have found that the Mandarm found on the products sold by 4 wine companies has not been caught long and long and hard, that the bandocks were not caught in the wine, that the TAPDK banners on the cap were collected after the products were sold, and that they were sold in combination with new wines.
The olysian teams claimed that the government had lost 20 million 400 thousand litres of taxes due to the re-use of the suspects.
The police teams also arranged the same time operation between the four wine companies in Istanbul, Ederne, Tekirdağ, Bursa, Balikasir, Manisa, Aydin, the Marine and Nevsahir factory and their warehouses today.
During the operation, a total of 55 people were taken into custody, 15 000 were sold in their calls, 52,480 were filled with the TAPDK Bandroll, 12,890 were caught by TAPDK, 3 tables and syringes, 100 boxed sexual inhaler, 9992, 698 bottles in various kinds of fake drinks and 100 litres of anacon.
55 of the 55 persons who were arrested were brought to the U.S. Department of Civil War Crimes in the Vatican Cadessi.
The suspects are running security operations.
The crew's operation to the factory, the warehouse, and the workmen was near the police cameras.
It was shown that police teams were using their calls to check out the wine bottles on the sale.
Full mail collected from used bottles has been stored by police forces injecting TAPDK's full TAPDK banner caps.
How will the rules of football affect Neymar's access to Paris?
The rules governing the prevention of the unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent the world's transfer of record from Neymar from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
A government that controls the European game from UEFA, which controls teams from the Presbyterian Championships from the League tournament, can produce all kinds of results from the UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
In 2011, UEFA's Financial Judiciary Laws, which were issued by the PSG, indicated that Neymar's transfer would eventually have to be shown that he had to finance his transfer without the loss of his life.
He paid 222 million avro ($262 million) to Barcelona to buy the Brazilians except for the contract, and will earn ten million dollars a year in Neymar.
Some of the financial ways of going to France from Neymar to France are:
The team can, of course, pay for the money received from the Katarli family when it comes to the money it's going to send to PSG Neymar and add it to the galaxy of other stars.
It's allowed to spend the money on the football player, but they also have to go back to their extraordinary sources of success in football.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that he was under the risk of inflassing the influence of a club that had earned him a great deal, and that if the banks or owners were to withdraw their support, he would be at risk.
In 2011, the FFP began to monitor the damages rather than the debt of the club.
The change meant that Roman Abramovic's model was first used in Chelsea in 2003 (a potential club, a high cost to improve the team, and a global brand).
In the 3-year FFP assessment period that has continued until 2018, clubs can be affected by 30 million conflicts.
Although Platini has been permanently removed from the presidency in 2015, he still has to decide on his resignation to Alexander Cefer, a member of the UEFA.
Andrea Traverso, who conducted the FFP in UEFA last week, said to Associated Press, "FFP is certainly not dead and we are going to strengthen the rules by taking them forward."
As much as PSG Neymar's purchase material is to be paid as a whole, it can be issued for accounting reasons in the contract period.
It signed a five-year agreement, so in the five-year annual accounts for which the transfer is to be granted, 44.4 million will be displayed as a currency.
In 2014, the first wave saw the application of the FFP, which was owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi, to Manchester City.
PSG, a further 60 million rounds (82 million dollars for that time) were fined, and the Champagne League team was ordered to limit the 2014-2015 season to 21 players normally 25 instead.
The UEFA is in a position to deal with a club that will try to deceive financial editors through companies connected with the club's owners.
Although a giant company can sponsor PSG, even if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be the default market value, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a fair asset.
In 2014, UEFA ruled that Qatar's tourism authority was involved in PSG sponsorship.
Niymar's winner from PSG was told that Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organization Committee could make payments.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022, they denied that Neymar would be a World Cup messenger, and such a move could be easily taken out by UEFA editors.
The actions applied to PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be more careful against the attempt to break the rules.
According to those who have reached the point of the day, UEFA does not have a prior meeting with the PSG on Neymar's transfer.
They talked to The Associated Press as soon as they couldn't talk about PSG's situation.
The latest published accounts show that PSG has over 10 million avro in 2015-16 compared to 542.4 million cirrhosis.
The accounts of the past financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship, gift and form sales.
After the club has been signed, the surgeon is expected to increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish League, which was obviously unhappy with one of the biggest football players, tried to prevent Neymar's departure by assuming that the PSG had captured the FFP.
La Liga, President Javier Tebas Spanish newspaper, pointed out that Qatar's possession of the PSG is a 'major doping' with the club and the government.
Arsenal, director of an American sports club, shares his findings about the financing by a government of La Liga.
Wenger said on Friday, "This has completely changed the whole country of football in the last 15 years."
"Everything is possible when you have a club in a country.
It is very difficult to respect the financial Fair Play because it may not be possible to have different ways or different fields of interest to represent such a large player for a country.
The status of 'square price' from the security guards
According to the TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaging since 2006.
In 2015, the sector affected by 2.35 billion TLs, only 19 million TLs were committed in 2016.
Borsa works in Istanbul, Axigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and South Sigorta.
At a meeting of the TSB's first six-month results, 2017, Chads said that the 11-year injury in traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, and that the injury of the tobacco industry was estimated at 2.3 billion TL this year, and that the forecast was 125 per cent of the injury.
This year, Chağlar, who says that the 2015 figure will be arrested, takes note of the fact that the damage recorded in 2012 and 2015, has taken into account other branches, "this means that we also increase the purchase of the county police of the poor driver's bank."
He said, "The 75 percent of the sector's foreign and our partners outside the country are making a bad driver in a sense."
The calls went on:
We don't have a car waiting for traffic, but we don't show that we've been driving for the past 11 years.
He said, "We accept this, but we hope that we will be able to carry it with the other police in a peaceful environment."
The Chaguls, who said that they were dramatic price increases when they took advantage of other traffic accidents, said, "In 2012, there were 30 percent increase in traffic insurance, almost twice in 2015 and we wrote the greatest damage in our history."
He said, "Even in such an environment, our wife became only 19 million TL by the end of 2016."
Chats, who are waiting for the next year's free fare to be passed, say, "We're going to lower the price of a good driver in the Serbian field and apply a high price to the bad driver."
He said, "But the Hazine is looking at the general course, the last word in the Hazine about when it will happen."
In addition to the fact that there has been a large proportion of the increase in traffic security since 2015, the highest price (tavan price) since Nisan 12 has been applied.
Therefore, the maximum premiums for traffic insurance in respect of each vehicle group, press and traffic density in relation to the policy concerned were identified on the basis of the annual rates of traffic insurance identified by the groups concerned in respect of accident statistics.
In eight countries, the "Rictical Safety Waters" has been implemented for high-pressure and high-speed traffic accidents or vehicle groups.
The traffic security in the water will be shared between the press and the damages associated with the police, insurance companies.
These security guards will be identified by the Prime Minister of the Interior.
In the first six months of the first year of the first year of the first year of the press, the number of police increased by 4.9 million to 8.6 million, and in the face of inflation, traffic police increased by almost 30 percent, according to the same trend in the first 6 months of 2017.
The Chats who say this year's traffic will take the women in other branches, "This animal's not gonna hurt this shit.
How much more can the damage sector carry?"
The jokes, who said that all companies in the sector would be 9 billion TLs, only when they were affected by 2.3 billion TL traffic, said, "You know, they're going to say, 'What's the good driver's money, and why are my thousands of feel paying the bad driver in Turkey?'
He said, "We're trying to tell Hazine what we said at this point."
As a result of these developments, foreigners in the Turkish security sector have been asked a question about whether they have not come to a point of weight reduction, "They haven't come to that point yet."
They're waiting to invest more in Turkey because there are six police officers in the Netherlands, it's 1.3 in Turkey.
He said, "It is a place where Turkey needs to grow in real meaning," and he continued:
They're not leaving here because they're not here.
But every year, the company gets a strong bond, but it's using it to make the company grow all over the world.
According to the TSB data, while the press production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL in 2016, the same trend over the first half of the year was made by 12 percent to 23.1 billion TL.
The players said that the sector predicted that it would not be completed by 15 percent in the production of the total press.
Social assistance to thousands of chronic patients
Family and Social Policy Officer Fatma Betül Seyan Kaya, who started working for a period of time with the help of "Cronik Diseases and the New Social Assistance Programme for the Management of Old Families" was identified.
The social assistance programme to be launched for families and families in need will benefit from a first-rate social assistance program of 4 000 300 tuberculosis and SSPE.
Patients will also be provided with regular psychosocial support on both sides of the mission.
A nurse will also pay for health care patients who have not gone to their care, who have lived their lives as dependent on bed, or who have had to improve their home lifestyles.
Payments will be made via social assistance cards provided by PTT.
Those who don't go to the door for money, like sickness and disability, will be paid for it.
The program, in many ways, makes it the first thing in the world.
One of the 10 companies I'm still going to invest in, Germany.
The Government of Turkey's Investment Support and Recognition Agency, President Arda Ermut, stated that the political transition between the two countries did not lead to the world of work.
Ermut used the words, "There is no investor in the relationship with Germany, who says, 'We're running out of this situation'.
Ermut, "About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
Some of them have an investment in Turkey.
He said, "The Germans are creating an important part of our daily work."
Ermut told Ibrahim Group that his association with Netlog's logistics company was a good example.
"We have contributed a total of $1 billion to Turkey," he said, indicating economic growth in Turkey.
Oh, my God, I'm going to be the Last Osman.
It was reported that the experienced footballer who gave him two weeks to find a club was able to sign a formal contract with Osmanlysport in our days.
At the beginning of the last season, the transfer ended four hours in the adult-age college, which signed a contract by 2019, with a 5-dollar, 29-legged, 2-inch, and a four-dollar-assistance performance.
I managed to get Özer back on his way back, and instead of this player, he made a deal with Brazilian Sergio Antonio this day.
The hundreds of transfers have been made!
Barcelona explained that Neymar transferred 222 million euros to Paris Saint-Germain for the battle.
In the last century, the transfer that the football team has pursued in the wake of the revolution was officially canceled.
The PSG paid 222 million euros for the Catalan team for the Brazilian player to be released, and the star name ended up on the screen.
Well, with this bonservis betel, it became the worst transfer of football history.
France 1. Football League (Ligue 1) has heard that Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) signed a five-year contract with the Brazilian Star Neymar.
According to the club's website, the bonservis was awarded 222 million avro to the top football team of the world's 25-year-old, Neymar signed a contract to form the PSG by 30 June 2022.
After the signature process, Neymar, who spoke on behalf of France, said he was very happy that he was dressed in French, "Since I started football in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most competitive and expensive teams."
I have a reason to join my team friends when I come to this club and take as many cupcakes as our side wants."
PSG will pay Neymar 45 million avro per season.
So, the star player's medal will have a fortune on the 400 million avonion of France.
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
The company of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to reach agreement on a collective agreement between the Turkish Maritime Union (TDS) and the United States.
And on that, the union member went out on 12th of December.
A month later, the strike ended at 15.00 a.m. after the strike against the workers.
According to the signed collective business agreement, 12 percent of the population in the world's population will be paid for their salary.
IZDENZ, who renewed his philosophy, was later admitted to the International Ship Sicilia, with the passing of the gain tax, and paid more than 25 per cent of the wages of the ship's crew for the staff in his status as a 5 per cent.
THE Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses had heard that the journeys in the interior would continue at a normal rate, that the journeys in the South would begin on the right day, that Foça and Urla would begin at the end of the week.

We're leaving the table in a way that's nice.
28 percent of the cable working on the sea will enter a part of the 20th century.
We also had friends who worked at Asira's payroll.
And We made them good in the land and in the sea, and We made them good in respect of their hire.
Notstalji, with "Slave American Letter" and "My Friend Detective"
So for the bright days of characters in the 80s, for the turn of the 90s (the times when the brains did the MTV "The State" for David Wain and Michael Showalter) and for himself, in 2001, before the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd continued with greater things.
As a cultural product, this is not to be confused with the fact that our constant remembrance of Facebook is being taken and stolen.
But as a series, it's like it's gone.
"The first day of the camp" was an unexpected success, and this was not just an absurd stage (in fact, H. Jon Benjamin had a story about the roots of a bikini.)
In the middle of the game, the main game was to recapture the old part of the game by moving to a comic book (playing the children of middle-aged actors) and playing the game.
Now, it's a little more sensitive, and it's more consistent with the monologous film of the 90s, like the "Salayan El" that adults are playing with.
At one point, an Apple Powerbook combines some isolated patents and "a lot of other things since 1991".
Most of the basic stories are the same.
He's no longer a writer, but he hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his mind yet.
Also now, George H. W. Bush has another crazy plan to meet Ronald Reagan (now Mr. Showalter) who was undercover by Michael Ian Black.
They always say the best part of the series.
In particular, it's nice to see young Mr. Rudd, who's always having six thoughts at Matt Dillon's feet, that he looks like Andy, the most popular kid in the old school.
There may be times of confusion in this series (e.g., "Seven Up!" series, which repeats a kind of "Sloven Up!") until I get to what I think is a reasonable conclusion: "Swift America's Letter: Twenty Years Later" that, in the final stage, my friend's group is going to see the rest of the "Sustain American Writing" film.
Meanwhile, a different type of non-nostalgia in Amazon: "The Americans" was resurfaced by the Cold War, the film "Sarshyn Bomba" and even the West, with the iconography against the West.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, a comedian managed by Rhys Thomas, appears to have been found on TV: a 1980s that fought for the true, atheism and the Marksist-Leninist path of the Romanian police.
They are played by Gregor Kurt and idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are held in English by Channing Tatum (also the leading producer) and by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a very bright idea.
But that's not much more than a thought.
There are some nice visual features (Americans watch football)
It's also a great voice-catcher, which includes Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny; it's a good subject for the game "who knows who."
But it's so called a "Dear Detective" propaganda drama that it's like the truth (reagan's mask of blood) that most people are playing exactly like it.
Six long sections can't pass, and the comedian's not fast enough.
When Gregor and Joseph continued to visit the American greatness of two hungry men who were eating hamburgers as always open in the lobby, they could bring the propaganda to a better place if the "friend Detective" was added to a longer term.
The message to the spiritual communist monitor could turn anything into a series of things in Western culture.

FETÖ's father's Canadians
The British Government has seen our family suffer the consequences of years of experience.
The government has accepted that the government has been closely linked to the English Government since its death and that it has been in great service.
The Government of England needs to be prudent and careful about this offer, to investigate everything carefully, and to decide carefully.
As he tries to understand the FETÖ, he takes advantage of the increase in the population as a starting point, but the forgotten difference is that the FETÖ's imperialist era is an event that has emerged and moved with the healing powers.
It's the Canadians who have to take the lead in this mine.
In the English language in the United Kingdom, he is identified as "the price paid by the Government of England," the founder of Kadiza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyānī, a Canadian poet.
Gulâm Ahmed, a small town in the province of Pencap, India's small town of Kadiyayan, said, "On 1st of 1888, God commanded him to get away from his own people and to create a separate nation."
In 1891, Gulâm Ahmed said that in 1891, according to his knowledge and the inspiration he had received, Jesus and Mary died with a body like other prophets, and that God sent him as a messenger and a Prophet, awaiting the believers and the Muslims.
So this is Mirza Gulâm Ahmed Kádiyanī, the same person with the message that the Muslims expect.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
After Sipahi's release, in India, under full British jurisdiction, Gulâm Ahmed, who wrote the books against Hindus and Christians, who was allegedly founded with sacred spirits, recalls Islam’s anti-introduction against Islam against the Communists and the Communists of the Red Cross in Erzurum, after the CIA's support.
Just like the Sun, the most popular idea of the emperors of Gulâm Ahmed is that if he can live freely, he will not be a fight against imperialism.
Even if you remember, as we went further in the morning, the calamity in our history occurred in a year in which we had suffered the persecution of the Screamers.
Surely between you and them there is a veil of red.
They never touch your wife or your daughter.
They're not connected to your mother, they're not connected!
The idea that Christianity unites itself, the idea that Islam will be the deliverer of its own society, the idea that the arms race is only a matter of mind-to-peak warfare, and the way of the spread of Christianity is generally taught in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of 'Tabes's population of 2 million Canadians, said to be around the world, is estimated to be 23 countries registered as a representative of the Humanity First aid organization in 1869.
In addition, 36 patients in 12 countries, 650 patients in 55 countries, only 8 were Canadians in Africa; in 11 countries there were 505 educational institutes and some 16,000 teams on the world.
In view of the fact that "the first Muslim scientist in Nobel Prize," Professor Abdüsselam, Sir Zaferullah Han, the United Nations President of the Court of Justice, "the Muslim actor who took over his prize" Mahershala Ali is also a Canadian, we can see more clearly the importance of universal power for the Canadians.
Let's note, ladies and gentlemen, that the meeting that we had last week with 30,000 people in England was also a show in a wall.
One of the slogans is a brief look at the history of Canadians who say, "Always be happy and hate no one."
Hulusa, FETÖ, or Tahir-Kadri, is able to hold out the exit points and motivations to the Canadians, and in fact all of them are in the process of passing into imperialism and supporting communities in order to serve in a sustainable manner.
"The desire" came out of the cargo.
Because of Pancreas cancer, Emily Pomeraz (50), who spent his last days in a hospital in Washington, U.S.A., asked for a restaurant in the city where she was born for coffee and chocolate-containing milkshake.
A girl's friend came in contact with the owner of a restaurant named Tommy's.
After 47 years of working at the same restaurant, Tommy Fello set up his drinking bag and paid a fee of $123 (435 TL) to the hospital 600 kilometers away.
Ahmet Kul's two new projects
To date, Lavinia Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has sold 7 projects in the Ahmet Kul Building in Istanbul Mimaroba, Dia Mare, Bodrum Yalykavak.
The Dia Mare project, developed by Mimaris Chamoğlu, was developed to maximize the benefits of the geometry of the project from the sea.
Dia Mare, placed on an 11 thousand square feet [11,000 sq m] area, has a total of 188 acres and 17 square yards.
The project will begin to be submitted to the new owners in March 2018.
He's got a multi-digit type that changes from 2+1 to 5+1 in Mare.
In this year, the company that will take two new chances in Mimaroba and Bitez is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapė in 2018.
753 million has been transferred to foreign companies.
He said that many programs were made out in TRT, where 6 000 760 people were working, and he paid for flights.
The CHP official, in 2016, transferred the national tax to the AKP companies."
He said, "This is my name."
The source of TRT's transport to the shipping companies was related to the data obtained from the official documents.
The CHP, a member of the United States of America, pointed out how TRT's resources were spent in the context of the Information Protection Act.
Despite the opportunities for all kinds of technology, the company, who worked as a framework for 6 000 760 people, said that in 2016 753 million TL 500 000 were transferred to companies through the external design program.
The CHP official used the expression "the meaning of this" to mean.
"Produktion companies in the AKP and their companies don't feed TRT."
He said, "Millions pay for deeds that are not recorded or that are not known to be taken away."
The Creator, who remembered that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the donations of the people, "the debt of seven thousand people turned to the back of the AKP."
"What programs did these companies sign up for which 7,000 people couldn't do?" she showed her attitude.
TRT indicated that the advertising company, personal loans and other guests, who explained that the advertising revenue in 2016 was 224,456,182 TL, was listening to it when the account was taken.
A friend, "AKP's voice is a TRT, and it can't be watched because she's not watching."
Newspapers are getting money from the TRT, making a lot of noise on behalf of the AKP.
He said, "He's taking people by force."
The CHP said, "Trt pays 660 million TL a year for people, but all the work is done outside."
From the TRT, 753.5 million of the population were deported to their neighbors.
It's an endless range.
And he ran away from her, and fell down before her, and begged for forgiveness.

Bank of England will keep track of %0.25
The Bank of England is expected to explain that soon after slow economic growth and inflation is reduced, there will be no change in fashion.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth would continue to "slow" because of the fact that family incomes would continue.
The Bank's decision-makers (MPC) used 6 to 2 months to maintain the rates at %0.25, so this month required a smaller increase after slow economic growth.
The Bank, in its three-month inflation report, took a rise in the forecast in 2017 to 1,7 and in 2018 to 1,6 and warned that the inflation would continue to increase to 3% in the future, with the expectation that the population would continue to increase to 3%.
However, in the years ahead, he indicated that higher rates of inflation would be needed in order to reduce Brexit's inflation and that debt payments would be more than expected in financial markets.
In addition, after Brexit, the members also used the game to restore a part of the economic improvement package that started a year ago.
The bank said that in the next month, the bank will finish the Global Funding Plan, which will end the bank's low-financed water, but in the plan framework, it expects more than $115 billion (up to £115 billion).
The bank, after a few minutes of decision-making, said, "The MPC's central goal is to move on slowly, in the middle of the narrow space (GSYH), and in the process of continuing to carry on its internal affairs."
In the case of Faizres, he pointed out that it might be necessary to reduce the inflation of "a lot of money" and that the market would be "a little higher" than he expected.
Peasants still predict that the first growth will take place in the third year of the coming year and another one will be in 2020.
But the bank's threatening to be "steps" and "limits" every step.
According to the estimates in May, this year's annual and future year's growth estimates are compared to %.9 and %.7.
In 2018, the bank is protecting the idea of a%.8.
Sterlin lost value in front of the party.
The pound was $1.31 by $0.5 and by $0.4 by 1.11.
The change decision came after the loss of the last large numbers that caused the loss of the GSYH in the first three months of the second round of the second cycle, according to %0.3.
It's probably going to be %0.3 in the third grade but the bank says it's going to start to show a slight increase at the end of the year.
When the bank says it's going to get worse before it's fixed, the latest inflation report, inflation, and cash increases will leave little to the peoples who are hit by it.
The bank said that in the years ahead, money policy will not "stop" but that it is expected that the budget's three-year forecasts will be fixed at the end of the "normal" amount.
At the end of the weak pounds, the increase in demand for British assets will support the economy by combining some of the cut-off costs.
The decision will come one year after the last August of the U.S. referendum, which took the lead in the polls, has been reduced to 0.25.
The bank predicts that this will take four years to affect prices and the economy as a whole.
Before the bank's final phase decision, there was an increase in the inflation pressure on the peoples in difficulty and a rise in the number of three policy makers, with an increase of 0.5.
The inflation rate was %2,9 months ago, but the bank said it was expected and it would increase again in the coming months.
The bank said, according to its targets of %2, my nose is related to the weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "When the final losses in the cases are taken into account, the job of those who have a debt is done and you have to shut down in a reasonable way, and the mortgage will become even more profitable.
The market seems to be well-known for those who have reached the end of the existing negotiations, and many free options and low rates are becoming more popular than ever."
NHS will write a HIV drug that is compatible with 10,000 people.
In the High Court of Justice, patients will be able to access HIV prevention every month following a fight against the financing of a drug in NHS.
In England, NHS reported that the risk of infection in high-risk individuals was reduced by up to 10,000 health services, including pre-sex-sex pre-suppressive pre-suspension prevention (PREP) for a 3-year pre-trial trial.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to finance the effort following the adoption of the Témyiz Court, and the decision was said to have the power to pay for PrEP against the claims of NHS's local authorities.
With this song on Friday, NHS England's president, Simon Stevens, introduced it as a 'new and serious procedure', the National Aids Trust (NAT) as a 'second point'.
In London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, the sexual health clinics will be clinical at the people's first level, and will have been applied to all of Nisan 2018 by more of my clinical team.
A number of HIV medicines reduce the risk of HIV infection prior to pre-maruz pregnancy (PREP).
Tests have shown that HIV transmission has decreased significantly among those at risk of infection.
PreEP taking before sex means that a person has enough medicines to prevent the spread of HIV infection in the body.
These medications can be taken up to two hours before each day or before having sex.
Those who are suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics; men, women, transexcile authorities, and their partners will identify appropriate participants who will be willing to try to control their HIV status in an anti-retroviral treatment.
Those who live in England and are registered in a practice of science will also be able to register for potential participation in local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold $10 million and signed an agreement to provide medicines this week with an offer to the NHS countries of England.
The test was designed to evaluate the full potential of the PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP was targeted, conducted and applied to large sizes.
Mr. Stevens said, "This is going to be in the midst of a broad, progressive and successful giraffe in the new and serious context of HIV.
This is another 30 years of progress in reducing one of mankind's major health problems.'
Nat's National Aids Trust spoke to Deborah Gold, who said, "This is a turning point in fighting HIV.
If they are targeted at what they need and are at risk, it is possible to convert HIV into England's PreEP virus.
People who carry high-risk HIV after their death will reach a new and powerful vehicle that is actually controlled and unopened by NHS, which will lead to many lives.
We're facing this feeling in a warm manner.'
Terrence Higgins Trust spoke to Ian Green: "First of all, it is necessary to ensure that the process is rapidly burned across the country and that the person at risk of HIV will not be left behind.
As the PREP test drug is now provided, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV.'
Shadow People's Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We're glad that the PrEP effort has begun, and it's been late for months and then the government's footing.
The evidence shows how much this drug can become a part of our view that HIV is inhibited and that this life-changing infection is going to end.
Deney will bring us closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it's important to protect the remaining people from HIV and to end the spread of HIV in the community as quickly as possible in the country's territory to bring us closer to the end.

Two secret deaths
The former Senate and President Ayhan Chilingarölu, a daughter born in Washington, D.C. (51) in Istanbul, Chile, also died from a work center used at the Hotel of Istanbul Levent in the 19th century.
Melis Saliholu, a 24-year-old college student, was also killed at home.
Saliholu's got his hair cut off.
The investigation of two secret deaths was initiated by the police and the police.
'DEPRECATED HALLI VARDI'
In 1971 the government of Nihat Erim took office in Turkey's first Sunday and the first district of Turkey's President Ayhan Chilingarölu, who was born in Washington in 1966, the daughter of Ummit Makbule Chilingarölu, who was born in Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on August 1, 1966.
In the 19th room, a police officer and police team were summoned to inform the authorities of a powerful tourist hotel manager who had been sitting in the room and who had not been informed for a while of his absence.
The health team reported that Chilingeronglu, who fell from the 19th floor, lost his life.
The mother of the police said, "There was a depression in those days."
On 31 December he arrived in Istanbul from Ankara.
I've got another girl who's got a cure tortoise.
He said, "It was about my tower, and my tower was affected if we don't get sick."
The funeral is expected to be held in Ankara.
It's investigated whether one of them was shot by a tiger, or whether it was an anterior.
'Canina KIYDI' IDE
The other suspect death in Istanbul lived in Sarajevo.
Melis Salihoğlu, who was a student at the University of Kocho, died at home (24).
According to the instructions, the young girl's father, who didn't get any information, and her daughter didn't get it from her cell phone, went to the house near the door.
Dad, she met her daughter's lifeless body at home.
His family, his close friends, and his very dear friend Melis's house, were driven by the progress he had made in his life.
Melis Salihoğlu's death and his family and neighbors were defeated.
A friend of Melis's next social media, "He was shooting at our face a bright bright sun."
We were in the middle of that little plastic group when our feet were running with the best friend Jack and her sister, Eysan.
"What was necessary to share the message of death now?"
Living a life of luxury: I've just turned numbers and smart design numbers into a different house for these little Earls Courts.
In 2014, former banker Joanne Leigh, who was in charge of the operation, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court.
It's a new piece of evidence that Queen Anne is convinced of not collecting Joanne's shoes.
"I used to live in a much larger area with my old love in Knightsbridge."
"I was looking for something that meant my sacrifice.
I was shown standing in Earl Court and had the same high courts.
I loved him, and I offered him a sacrifice on that day."
After the first meeting, 1000 ft of steel was refurbished from the bottom.
At the beginning, there was a single room and a densely populated kingdom; you had to pass through the kitchen to reach his bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage area and an object bed for the maximum use of the roof.
"I wanted high walls, large windows, and very light.
It was my speed."
To this end, Notting Hill, the center of the museum and the design studio, Duck & Shed, has managed to get Erfan Azadi from 12.5 fts and not just a building to create a place where Joanne will live at the same time.
Tavan, it wasn't high enough to add up to two areas, so it was hard to create an object that you could stand in its feet.
He had to think creatively to solve the matter tomorrow.
"It's very complicated."
"We had to set up excuses so that they could assemble themselves without any need for training.
It wasn't just a simple platform to build, but at the same time, the plants would be such that they would be in the right height according to the function above or below."
This adjustment, bringing many more dramas, made it possible for Erfan to get two full-size rooms on one of them.
The old guy who was taken from Retrouvius for the asma cat looks at the light window, looking at the wonderful area of life below.
The style of the entire design of Serge Mouille is defined by the famous gold-coloured furniture, silver rings, and old type.
The use of machines plays a role in adding space, field and light.
The signs of the short corridor, which are located on both sides of the river, make it look longer.
Specifies the visual effects that will be shown on the panel. This key is only relevant if the window is already in use.
The intruders in front provide Joanne's entire catalytic rock band with a hiding area.
The beauty of the sitting room that created a more amazing area is, if I don't use it.
It's not new when it's opened.
If it's free, it's a door that can be lifted up in the garage.
In the morning, it opens the door of a well-enforced MDF, "We used a lot of engineering here."
"There's a heavy burden, so when you're on the door, it's really easy."
Joanne won a 16-metre, more than a bedroom and a well-enhanced seating plan because of the clever use of the area and the hiding area.
"There is something you will sell at the end of the day, or the value of your property is determined."
"As in Egypt, a farmer will enter and make an account of the seasons."
They were able to use the high-quality material that gives the ground area an increase in the area.
He says in the morning, "It's the things you've touched, so it's gonna help you build a emotional bond at home."
"In the house, you won't love the electricity lines in the wall.
That is important, but your hearts do not transgress.
That's a good design and an increased metrical system, which shows you can turn a standard into something very wonderful.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jereain Lens' bunker at Bešiktaş
At the end of the 1.5-month meeting, Lens was transferred to Bešiktash, the capital of the capital.
After the last week's talks, Lens, a black-white team agreed to a five-million-euro bonservis betel.
The 5-year-old player in the Netherlands was taught to get $2.2 million a year.
Five is expected to make an official statement about Jeremy Lens' transfer.
Marriage photos of common couples
The actor and singer Emre Altuğ entered the world's house in Soritie, where he lived for about four years.
Both of them said, "Our life was the most special thing," and the picture that was taken from the wedding ceremony was death.
Two weeks later, she decided to separate.
The brothers are fighting for 500 million dollars in government.
Two brothers, just a few years after the Italian families were born, were fighting for one of Victoria's biggest property owners, worth more than $500 million.
The director of the former Carlton Football Club and the expert Colin De Lutis, in Toorak, is living at three doors away from Paul, a small brother who gave himself to the High Court.
Paul had been trying to get out of the family since 2014, but he was still having serious arguments at the High Court on divorce.
His mother and Anna, brothers and sisters, Smith Sokay, are owned in 1973 by 38 owned by more than half a billion dollars from a store they bought in Collingwood.
There, the family built Westco Jeans, and he grew up in a city with a sales center at 160 feet.
It was sold to $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested and De Lutis's portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and malls in the bathroom.
In a contract with his father who died, Colin (as described by Paul as "a relatively small power and dominant person" in the De Lutis family) owned three companies, and Paul has one third.
One court file says it means Colin has $316 million, and Paul has $176 million worth of property.
It's about sharing wealth and fame for Paul.
In his first statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions suggested by Colin left him with the best things I've ever heard."
The first High Court hearing was held after the accident that caused many failures.
The brothers are also arguing about who will control the work they are doing; Paul says Colin left himself out of work.
Colin's defending that this is wrong, but he blames Paul for being unmanaged by some of his possessions.
Colin says he's hoping to resolve the disagreement in a secure statement he gave at the outset.
"The hearts of my Italians will tell me that my family is the most important priority."
Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Carter Keck Cramer, also included in the company, increases hundreds of pages of security statements, e-mails and Allan Myers, and best lawyers, such as the QC, and the best lawyers on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and his wife, Luigi, were a family of Italians and musicians since the late 1950s, and they bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin's family had refused to buy Collingwood's property, which opened his first box of pants.
Colin says, "Even in my last few years, Paul was a little boy (10 years old)" there he built Westco.
Anna De Lutis himself and Luigi, who died in 2012, say that he hoped to leave his property in a friendly way to his sons.
"Louigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court."
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis's group; when Colin left his job, he paid Mark $10 million and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark "were happy about the conditions of financial separation."
According to the 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, best friend of the television year, Colin tried to make sure that an AFL club was an old board member.
Fairfax Media, Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers were contacted on Friday.
He just said, "I can't say anything more because Colin's brief message is in court."
"My brother Paul chose to blame me and to bring our family to court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote that he was trying to bring his brother's requests to the court office.
"Our father, Paul and I didn't want us to get into an argument." And he added, "He's still hopeful about my speech."
It looks like it's gone on Friday.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future."
Trump's plan is to cut off the media from another word.
And the others were tested and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do this.
If that's the case, it'll be the first.
Politico, a new White Saray specialty, indicates that he will limit the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports), with the hope of keeping his pattern more stable.
Some little information from Professor Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly's new special address on the first day of his visit, White Saray revealed a basic problem that President Donald Trump was planning to solve about white Saray: the fact that bad information was passed on to others.
Kelly told the people on the paper or with the briefings that knowledge should be based on itself, because the president would be able to make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly's reputation is very meaningful, but others have tried to emulate Trump by testing his medical condition.
President Trump's TV is on the way ten years ago, and he's still in White Saray, the TV show's still in good shape.
A former campaign speaker, Sam Nunberg, said to Politico in March, "If you're sorry that Aday Trump didn't take a place in the media in a fair way, it would be more likely to show him that he has a fair place in the media."
Tara Palmeri from Politico then wrote: "In view of the six campaign tasks, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter business under control was to make it possible to make it possible to receive a considerable amount of personal media revenue."
Okay.
But it's funny that Trump's Twitter activity is "under control" at any time.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about, like Trump's tweets, they're going to be much more exciting if they don't have their own ways.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If the elements could take him away several times, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one could prevent Trump from creating a constant debate.
Some of the problem was that of white Saray's rivals, that is, those who tried to communicate their own ideas with the material they led to Trump (they could be trusted or untrustworthy) and that they were not the ones who were leading their world's attention.
In May of the month of politics, throughout this story, the speakers reported on how to communicate information in a strategic manner.
This is an example told by Professor Shane Goldmacher's details:
"The existing and former Trump officials say that they are extremely critical of the buffers, especially those that have a negative effect on the forces that they have been subjected to and that they are forced to find out where they are from.
On the other hand, at the end of the day, the Internet procurator Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com did not interrupt a printed copy of an article that accused Katie Walsh of being a "source behind a series of bars" in White Saray.
It doesn't matter that Johnson was charged with a bribe from Twitter, that he didn't have any evidence, or that he committed crimes in the past, and that he was turned away from them.
Trump read the article and began to ask questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher, then private secretary of Reince Priebus and White Saray, added that Rob Porter was "a system that managed and attempted to establish a documentary system".
How did this turn out?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he's going to be a more active manager than Priebus, but Trump is still fighting for the courage of his supporters.
These constant factors will make Kelly's job very difficult.
Krypto FETÖ"s output from the private template
The Federal Republic of Korea has completed its inquiry into the fact that the Order of the Sea Forces of the Sea, known as the Order of Personal President of the General Court, started to state that the FETÖ is the FETÖ is the FETÖ in the case of certain infractions in the case of the "armašek case of the armed forces."
In addition to not being a member of the General Assembly, he was arrested and actively played a role in the struggle with FETÖ in the defence of the crypto occupiers in the Command.
On 15th of December, when Yajjju was registered as a minister, according to the order of the Government of the Sea Force, the decision indicated that he was attempting to repatriate him by ordering the command of the Commander of the Marine Forces, six of which was the first day that the Yajjjjüer's entry into the workplace was the subject of a conflict against FETÖ.
In a follow-up decision given by Karakaya, the words were used: "The owner, the owner of the crypto abuse service class, has understood that the staff of the FETÖ members has worked on the responsibilities of the Administrative Board of Directors and the special system established on the basis of the 64 basic criteria by 209 sub-criterate criteria."
It is our intention to assess, at the end of the debate, the existence of an active terrorist attack against the accused, the suspect and the victim of an alleged crime, and the victim of an alleged terrorist attack, as if there were no complete evidence of the existence of an alleged terrorist attack, and in this regard it is not possible for us to assess the merits of the alleged threat to the Messiah.
The General was accused of committing a crime before.
After that, it became clear that the FETÖs were still there and that the accused was not guilty.
The former Air Force Kurmay Albay Hakan Dinç, in his complaint to the owner, has only turned the complaint into a note of information.
Tanker Super Command Air Pilot General Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of Investigations, former President of General Albay Muharrem Köse, former President of General of the Investigation, former President of the Directorate-General Mustafa Özsoy, former Chief of Staff, former Chief of Staff, former Chief of Staff, and former Chief of Staff, has been charged with the arrest of former Chief of Staff, Akif Us and former Chief of Staff of Staff, and former High Commissioner of Staff of Directors, who have been charged with the arrest of Mr. Kurmay Albay Mustafa Číčicek, FETÖ.
The fact that some of Tuncay Opcín's ideas of FETÖ's company were among those that were aimed at Yajjjj in 15th of November and later with social media participations.
The passengers opened her up, returned to 'riches'
Some of the richest owners of the West Midlands are struggling again with the most powerful passengers who have been caught by the council to get back to their homelands.
Travellers parked their 20-star caravans outside a remote area of Solihul at the time.
The Consei returned after they had been forced back in May, with the horses, the babies, and a full loaded car.
There was an empty space in the security of the Zakice movement, and he broke into the direction of setting up a road from a section that had not been abandoned.
The angry people, saying it's useless to solve the problem, turned the Solihull Council down.
A quiet man said, "They've been sent from Bentley Heath to the people on the other side of the street, and they've come there for the Passover night.
You should be ashamed of the council's actions because it's useless to solve the problem.
The travelers were there in May, and were sent back.
There's more to it last night, and maybe more to come today."
He added: 'Birmingham knows how this will happen with the long-term extension decisions taken to protect the parks.
I, I live on the street of Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy to continue paying my taxes while the council can't stop this.'
A village that did not want to give its name said, "We have seen that the last group of passengers is still separated, and we are now surrounded by a new group.
The numbers were increasing this time and a horse was sitting in the parking lot.'
A woman from the Solihull Council said, "We realize you're an unauthorized camp between the Streetsbrook Soka, and we're starting the legal process to send them away.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important to inform the police of any anti-social or criminal conduct by calling 101, as far as possible.
This will help us get the judge to take care of our case."
Galatasaray, I've told you about Meaye.
Galatasaray Sports Surveys and Ticari Investments from the United States sent to Borsa Istanbul and explained that Kamuuu is located in the Platform for the Development of the Camp, which will pay 7 million euros, 500 billion for the football industry in Osmanlyspor for the benefit of the football team.
Galatasaray will pay the total amount of $2,750,000 avro per year to Ndiaye, which has signed a 4-year contract.
In addition, the TFF Super Lig and UEFA will be awarded a five-billion-dollar prize for each of the games played by TFF Super Lig and UEFA passengers.
It was also reported that the player had the right to negotiate 18 million Avro since 15 June 2019.
It's the last day!
They rushed to their stations at the airport.
In Istanbul, he suffered thousands of car losses, along with the storm that struck us on Friday.
While most of the drivers reported reporting on the accident to be handled by the insurance companies, they were also involved in reporting by unreported drivers today.
And today, the drivers that I'm not aware of, they've come to the office and they've come to the office to report that this is the last day of the notification.
Today's Last Day
The driver took pictures of the vehicles to his office to identify the damages of his vehicles.
Drivers who reported damage to their vehicles later reported to the officials.
Hasan Erol, who came to the office for the report, said, "I made a record. I'll take a picture."
When I came, there was a fever.
He said, "There was a damage in my soul."
Driver Erbil Külch, "We're here to run."
We're on our way.
We took the picture.
He said, "Now we'll wait for the report."
Heavens that are walled with the sea do not breathe
The CHP Meclis member Nadir Ataman, in his report on high-level constructions, recorded them: "Davadaki's knowledge report says that these buildings will not stop under 6 pressures."
It's said that the weight of the healthy rock is between 25 and 30 meters lower than that.
Istanbul's Atakóy left a lot of high-class hotels and residents in the middle of the sea.
The CHP's Méclis Meclis, Nadir Ataman, pointed to the AVM, hotel and residence projects in the afternoon.
Father, who took note of the line of buildings in the street, said, "Those who planned 80 years ago created the Atatrurk Army in Florida.
And 80 years later, according to the approach of an urban understanding, the heavenly bodies changed the climate to the direction of the golden corridors.
He said, "There's no breath in the lake."
Father, who explained that the buildings such as the wall changed the interior of the building, continued: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the survivors."
These buildings need to be built in the direction of the tunnels.
But our heavens are rising above Istanbul's giant corridors.
He can't go into the rain forest.
These arrangements violate the natural cycle of life.
The father, the environment, and the human health, said that these heavens were also bound by the Red Sea, and that the people of Bakruk were going to enter the cause of the Truths concerning the Qur'an.
It's possible to be treated without surgery when you're back in the year.
The success of 83 percent of patients with phenol applications is achieved.
In this way, a diseased doll is cleaned up in an active form and filled with an agent that kills the bones of the docs.
One of the other treatment techniques is a laser procedure.
With various lasers, the dots and the dots around the neck are heated by continuous light, and it causes the dots to be stuck in the middle of the fire.
In view of these two non-aggressive methods, patients can return to their social and working life in a short time.
Dr. Mert Atak noted that there were disorders such as pain, infection, seizure, and fatigue among the patient's symptoms that caused him to return to his senses.
Italy restricts the approach to STK's moveable lifeboats
Italy warned the STKs that they would not be allowed to continue if they did not comply with the new rules affecting their operations in Akdeniz.
In his report to La Stampa, Mrs. Marco Minniti, said, "If the STKs don't follow the new style, it will be difficult to see them continue to act."
Minniti's warning, the Italian authorities, the German relief agency Jugend Retett, came one day after a day after he was suspected of being actively cooperating with human refugees in order to facilitate a ship operated by Jugend Retett.
The aid agency, which had only been active for a year, refused to take action on the content of the specific symptoms directed against them by Italian warrior Ambrogio Cartosio.
In an explanation in the social media, he said, "The salvation of human life is our most important priority, and that will be our priority, so now we are very sorry that we cannot work in the area of call and rescue."
"We can only appreciate the crimes that are committed now, after we have collected all the information and made it possible to evaluate the situation."
Italians have been monitoring Jugend Retett's ships since the month of the commission.
It is suspected that they have been caught by human escapers, who have taken them to a boat full of plastic bottles, and have allowed them to escape using them on their own.
According to the files of the lawyer published by the Italian media, it was at least one such meeting, according to the idea, when Libya opened 1.3 miles.
In addition, many human efforts have been made in the area for the sole purpose of not counting the Italian health security authority that has been responsible for the rescue operations in the area.
According to the letter, there was to be an Italian police officer who was clearly monitoring their activities in the safety of such ships as Yuvetta.
Only three of the nine people who took place in the search and rescue operations agreed to follow the line until now: Save The Children, Malta's Central MOAS and the Pro-Activa Open Arms.
On the very day of the end, he assessed that the new rules were unnecessary but not acceptable because he said there would be no "severe change or delay" in his own rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign are Nobel Prize-winning Doctors (MSF).
In the meantime, Minniti said that a short drop in the number of immigrants who came to Italy after last week's rescues showed that the efforts to strengthen Libya's health security and cooperation with the local elections were evidenced.
"We started to see the light at the end of the tunnel in those days."
With the Libyan elections this month, further discussions on economic development initiatives and plans to reduce the number of displaced persons leaving Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali.
Last minute's rain!
Russia's president, Moscow, has been drinking a new vodka every year as it celebrates "a day of racial unity".
A Russian television broadcast in the Russian Gorki Park, which was active and over-alcoholed, was attacked by Russian TV director Nikita Ravuzjaev.
He warned the man who, in the course of his life, had been born blind and faithless, "We will imprison Ukraine."
The drunk man, who had been an ex-wife, struck him with a serious stroke on his warning.
He tried to get away from the man who was working with him.
Millions of people have been watching the clock.
Economic Coordinating System
The Economic Coordination Framework (ECK) was convened at the Chief Executive Officer Mehmet Shimšek, responsible for the economy.
The ECK meeting, which was held for the first time in the Czech Republic, began at 18.30 p.m. following the change in the cabinet in the government.
At the meeting, Turkey's macroeconomic vision will be taken into account.
At the meeting of the President of the United States, the Minister of Finance, the Ministry of Finance, Science, Science, Science and Technology, the Department of Economic and Social Security, the Special, Labour and Social Security Branch was included in the meeting of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Finance Lüffi Elvan, the President of the Central Bank, Murat Chettika and the bureaucrats concerned.
It's possible to save you in 45 minutes from the fall.
Dr. Oşz Karaemino, who observed that patients should only be treated by 5 percent in the treatment of Bel fever, says, "The first step is to get rest and medical treatment based on the results of the disease."
In particular, Oçz Karaemino’s warning that there is a need for access to the patient’s pain groups (e.g. epidural injections, radio-fraction techniques, disk inhalation) that “if all of these methods are not successful, if they are identified by the drugs and weaknesses in the legs, then the operation is still necessary” is advised.
Karaeminos, the most risk-weighted patient in our day, say that it is possible to get rid of the disease within 45 minutes of the disease:
Although there are very good results with open surgery with microscopic surgery, long recovery after surgery can be compared to some complications such as bone loss and infection.
Most of the time, microscopic surgery is known as a 'spatial surgery' but also as a microscopic surgery, it's applied to the same approach as open surgery.
These risks are at the center of the operation of a completely closed door, because of the protection of the surrounding docks.
It's only 45 minutes away from the operation of a completely closed wall.
In the Special Commission
The CHP will take place in the Commission by the Member of the Council of the European Union, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission, Istanbul 14 on 4 October of Berberoglu.
He will also follow the instructions made to the Court of Anayasa and the Court of Justice of the District.
The CHP Secretary-General's Secretary-General is you and the Assistant President of the General, Bült Tezcan, in writing, "The fact that his case is free and impartial, and that he does not take orders from any other place without the right is a matter of urgency."
"Our country has not requested any special status in the task of Mr. Ennis Berberoglu's nationality, has not been protected from the inhumanity of his nationality, and wants to protect his belief in his innocence and impartiality."
The case was ruled that the court prefers to apply political orders rather than the court's case.
In the letter, the Court of First Instance found that despite the decision of the Court of First Instance to arrest its citizens, the Court of First Instance had been found guilty of an inconsistencies and that there was clear evidence that it had been decided under the influence of the Court.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for encouraging Conrad Roy's efforts
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in prison for trying to force her boyfriend to text and telephone conversations.
Michelle Carter, now in his 20s, is going to take a 15-month sentence and spend five years in prison.
In the month of Carter's death on 13 November 2014, the court ruled that Conrad Roy himself was killed by a cab driver.
Mr. Roy's father spoke on Friday at the meeting, saying, "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free so he could open the way.
He was sentenced to a 20-year sentence, but he and Mr. Roy had been away from mental illness.
Carter, a red pants and cream-colored blue, was in the shape of his old eyes, his hands were beautiful and his eyes were on the ground when he was being punished.
The lawyer said, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He spent his life trying to improve himself.
He didn't accept responsibility."
"He didn't show you any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation in which he felt sorry for all of himself."
Well, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he didn't see any significant impact on the actions of the elderly, the elderly, the disabled, and even the mentally ill.
One lawyer read Mr. Roy's mother's statement to Lynn Roy: "I don't have a day to cry for my dear son's loss.
I want him to be proud of me and how everything comes up, and I'm trying to be with his sisters forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, gave the word that the truth "does not come out of her mind" that he would never join his brother's wedding or that he would never marry his children.
He said, "I've been with you every day since I said, 'This man that you've been with is always going to be with me in the rest of my life."
It looks like there's no such thing as a case-by-case case-law.
Mr. Roy was 17 years old when Carter died of carbon monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The fact that Carter's brief messages encouraged him to finish his own life was a matter of national interest.
And when she was pregnant with her family, she said, “I do not know how many years you have gone out of a building, and I do not know.”
In the past, he wrote, "You should do this, Conrad" and "You'll be free and happy to open the only generator you need to do."
Judge Moniz advised that he would not be allowed to leave this case on the press, so Carter said he wanted to take care of Mr. Roy's death.
The case broke down the legal proceedings.
There was Amanda Knox, who was guilty of killing a friend of the British room in Italy two years before he was found guilty of killing Carter in 2007.
Ms. Knox (30), in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, published a letter stating: "Michelle Carter deserves my understanding and help, not prison."
A guess-the-fly game from Mehmet Shishek
In his statement, he pointed out that inflation in Turkey is the only cause of decline in numbers, and he said that it created a "risk area".
The President's Assistant suggests that inflation will rise by 7 percent in 2018.
She said in her smiles:
It's 12 months ahead of us in terms of ignorance.
The greatest encouragement is to reduce uncertainties.
There's a powerful government.
There's no privacy.
I hope there's also a lack of detail in our closer relationship.
I believe that by increasing our resistance to shocks with a million reform, we're sitting on a growth trend over the 5th century of Turkey.
I told you months ago.
That's the worst thing I've ever done.
Slowly, not to those areas, but to reform to increase our energy, to increase our energy, and to increase our demand...
That's why it's 12 months ahead of us.
On the one hand, reform has been replaced by uncertainty, and there is no political uncertainty.
And our chances of success are that the pressures in our near future are gone.
And if we don't want it, it's a lot of classics.
Libya, like Iraq.
We just don't lose the Pazar, we're facing a movement wave of 3.5 million.
When we last looked 15 years, Turkey grew to 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, we have health problems.
Now, by increasing our presence against the shocks of a million reformers, we're going further to Turkey's policy of enlargement over 5 percent.
I'm gonna tell you, I'm out of here, and we've got such a generous emotive system.
I think it'll be boring if I tell you that our business doesn't show up enough.
Once in my car, performance will be strong.
Why?
Because we've got it.
Firms don't have to go out and spend a lot of effort and expense.
We've done a lot of gambling, taking into account the lack of performance, and how we're going to figure out what global resources are in the fields of investment.
You know, it's high.
And it's going to be a performance there in 25 percent of your government as a net.
And the rest of the vessel's back to the stock paper, and there's a lot of risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think you'll be more interested in me in the future.
Because they'll see the performance.
It's not a failure on the other side, it's a success.
We reconfigured BES in 2013.
6.8 million participants, 70 billion lire units.
The system has succeeded in giving you the right.
I've got 2.6 million participants in my automatic engagement, and I have 775 million lira units.
We want a lot more than the companies.
Let's make some announcements, let's talk about this system.
We're working during the night.
Maybe we'll make her a little fun.
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe he sees my office and stays in the system.
38 percent of those out of the system.
Almost half of those who are separated have a direct environmental impact.
You don't want the two of you to have a mental illness account again.
What are you doing?
You're leaving my car.
We were waiting for a shift around 10 percent.
That means we're very good at it.
He's working the system once.
We brought a primé tajana.
They're explaining security companies on their own.
They've increased their premiums very quickly.
When we asked what was going on, they said that they didn't take care of the legal decisions they had made.
We've made a new cleanup.
We told you to do the same thing.
They said no, we'll wait for the trial.
We said it wasn't like that.
We have a difference of opinion here.
Of course, some companies have even succeeded in implementing this flag.
We've made a new arrangement.
We've created an air of risk-safes.
I'll tell you that, I'll do it again.
I prefer to run this system on a keyboard basis.
So I don't find these wild offers right, they left us tired.
I want three sizes to see this.
Take care of the system we're doing.
Two, the system works normal, that's a payout.
It's heavy loads from her shoulder, every 100 lire premium that pays almost 30-31 litres of SGK's fine.
I'm working now, and we're gonna talk to our financial sister.
Thirdly, technology is moving fast.
And now the traffic accidents will be seriously reduced.
But it's a dangerous traffic security.
SABAH saved his life's leg
The disorder that resulted from pregnancy was a disorder that had been observed in men since childhood, but now it has begun to be common among women.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehap.
The pain that began two years ago has been chronicized on the foot.
The young woman who was forced to walk was in the hospital when she was at risk of losing her leg.
A friend suggested to Prof. Joseph Kalko.
He showed the news on "Azerbaijan Alağan was saving the lives of Haller Kahney," who lived in Sabah.
That's what happened when Dursun, who went to Kalko, fought with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko, he took his young woman to an emergency operation.
You'll be saved from their pain soon, and now you'll see the oxygen treatment.
Audi 850,000 Diagnosis Tool to edit when faced with a crash
A day before Audi heard it, he said BMW would be able to raise more than 350,000 software in his car.
BMW's director of the BMW administration, including the BMW's central (meaning to write or restrict personal tools), said that the company believed that the company had "more intelligent options than the restrictions. "
On Tuesday, the three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe said they would change to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies, they didn't recognize them as calling back.
European car manufacturers, Europe and the United States encouraged the use of diesel tools to help prevent carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that the diesel engines open are detected by the cancer manufacturer and can cause damage.
It also increases the membership of the team that needs to be equipped to neutralize the damage caused by diesel vehicles and makes it difficult to keep the car’s cost recoverable.
The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel accused German car manufacturers of anti-industrial investigations and of neglecting the orders of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors in normal driving as they try to adjust their emissions while hiding a device known as a wrong device and testing a car.
Many of the Volkswagen managers were convicted in the U.S.A. and the others were questioned on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the Audi engine development department was under arrest in Germany, the former chairman of the thermodynamics.
Former Governor Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore a criminal, can be found in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was sent to a German criminal investigation including Volkswagen, and after the authorities charged Audi with a system for the release of the Emissions Regulations in Europe, the United States expanded its central investigation.
It may be difficult for Volkswagen to get involved in audition: The luxury car manufacturer has a very expensive loan in the vicinity of Volkswagen.
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
President of the Turkish National Court of Justice, Professor Dr. Joseph Thank you for the fact that no fishing is carried out in areas more than six feet [2 m] deep.
Each year, thousands of people are at risk of drowning in cold water, and the damage caused by malaria is due to a fatal accident.
It's five or six times as common as bone fractures.
The properties of the fractures are not affected by the vertebral muscles that are in the back of their arms and legs in this level.
Professor Dr. Chagüller, "The most valuable organ in these types of cases is removed from or decomposed by a breach."
He said, "The first wrong aid in harming the security is not to increase the damage in the accidents and can lead to death."
Fishing is taking place during the fourth season of the drought.
The average age of the wounded is 20-29 and the majority are men.
Prof. Dr. Plays, "It's not supposed to be fishing in water that's not in sight."
He said, "If you leave as much as you can, you may suffer a great loss."
Prof. Dr. Chengs also recalled:
The damage caused by fishing can be caused by different levels of arms and legs, depending on the quality of the land where the damage is caused by fishing.
You may know the ring, but it can be a water-smelling.
The place that looks like you're deep.
The warning on the seabeds in the United States and Australia was shown in 70 percent of the catchment vessels in the catchment vessels.
Professor Dr. Chağlars, "Despite the fact that there is a 28-year-old seabed in Turkey, there is no single alert table in areas outside Istanbul."
"The decision on these types of disasters requires that every year, health management, education and social awareness project should be made available to the seafarers or to the public in an interesting way."
Mr. Kadir Kotil, President of the U.S. Secretary-General, suggested that the following should be done in the event of an accident:
It should be 112 for the first time in the event.
The size should be kept as strong as possible, not moved, and detected with a strong stone.
The airway must be provided and the patient must be transferred to the water tank.
You shouldn't get caught by the rocks and let go of the water.
Do not try to fix the size of the patient.
It's probably broken.
However, if breast cancer has not yet been damaged, it may result in an inappropriate position to be given to the patient during the first treatment and during the transfer of the patient, which may result in the pressure of the bone parts to the bone marrow and the loss of the bone.
Provence facility under threat of climate change
He turned to a symbol of Provence in South France, but he had a warning that climate change was under threat.
Lavanta lives because of cold, cold, and disease-like bugs, and this situation is causing great pain to the scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, professor at CRIEPAM, Provence Central Research Institute, said: "The bathroom in Provence has been in danger in recent years because the climate changes that have made it much less and more difficult to be at the end of the day.
This is affecting the life of the bathroom.
And there's a small axtos that's infected with a micro-bacterium, and there's a lot of them in the dry air."
And many things are in danger.
For perfumes and cosmetics, as far as they are concerned, the bathroom is covered with a glass of water.
Eric Chaisse said, "We have smaller, less developed, or no or weak ones, while a few large trees have to have a lot of long-term growth.
I mean, we've got less basic rain particles."
Among the solutions that are considered, it involves facilitating better water distribution and depletion from the soil, but it also has a protective barrier and a more stable form of water mix and difficult conditions.
Journalist murder is drawing down the biggest threat in Mexico.
The weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff in the Sinaloa state have generally met the latest charges, missing members, and unconventional drug war plans to take place in the newspaper.
But today, they came to a meeting to talk about their safety in the shadow of their own tragedies.
He told them it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists see how much more security they feel about bringing their children and their own children to the office with which a hand bomb was aimed in 2009 or leaving them home.
Security experts wrote three words on the front floor of the room: prisoners, strangers, volunteers.
They want names for every column of theirs, and there is no need for any evidence, and there is enough for them to hear and hear.
Drug plaintiffs, politicians, people at work, the government or the cartels are suspicious journalists, a list-full-time journalist, who poses a threat to the writing work in Mexico.
While there are no payrolls, there are more than more journalists throughout the country: According to the Committee on the Protection of the Journalists, at least 25 people have died since President Enrique Pena Nieto took charge of 2012; 589 under federal protection and this year died at least seven.
And among the last dead, there are writers and intellectuals who have written works, including Javier Valdez Cardenas, a Riodocian poet.
Valdez writes, "The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and becoming a journalist."
His absence is felt by his absence, but his presence everywhere, with a large picture showing Valdez's middle finger, is rooted in the head of Riodoce's building, two princes, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wearing his smile, face, and Panama hat.
At work, two months before his death, the participants are talking about their fellowships, their clubs, their sleeplessness, their paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal ban was created to take over the press in 2010, the Committee on the Protection of Journalists has only moved them.
Every year, drug trafficking and organized crime are brought to the front of the law, which includes thousands of murders, such as the murder of journalists.
In Riodace, although their hearts are broken, they are forced to change the violence in Sinaloa, despite the fact that the earth is becoming more corrupt.
Ibarra says it's a little hard to find security without knowing about the killers, not being fair, not knowing about the killers.
"It's so stupid to spend my time at work."
"You don't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
On May 15, Valdez, president of the state, left the Riodace office in Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corrolla could only hold a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forced out of the vehicle and 12 times shot for the name of the newspaper that was translated into the Ten Commandments.
The gunman walked out of his car and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two grown children are gone.
What they said at Culiacan is on my freeway course.
But there's nothing but silence about Valdez right now.
After Guzman's arrest last year and after the attacks to the United States, he became one of the bloodiest war areas in Sinaloa's country in order to fill the void.
In Sinaloa, let everyone or many people be killed and killed every day, or the drug-in-laws are filled with many more houses than those that are cut down, two houses, and more houses to live.
For a minute, just forget the "sykunet" condition of controlling drug abuse routes to the U.S. valuable ports of the single folder and the U.S.
Despite this, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's partner and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60) was removed from the crime because he failed to protect his friend.
He believes that the two errors were in the shed.
The first was a report by the leader of one of Guzman's rebel cartel groups, who fought with Guzman's sons in the summer.
This letter may have angered the sons; possibly the members of the court had taken every issue of the press to be distributed to the press.
The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after he spoke to another newspaper where the same story took place.
Valdez was an embezzlement outside of Mexico and the country, and his murder was seen as a point of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been alive for a long time, and his friends and colleagues always knew he'd be there.
He was an experienced businessman in Noroeste in 2013 when he sold 50 dollars to his five fellow employees when Riodoce was sold in the middle of his career.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to make journalism about drug abuse," Bojorquez said.
In time, he became involved in newspapers, business, and honest news and increased advertising with sales.
The leaders were eager to publish life-threatening research without fear, and the students were distracted by what they could read, which they could not tell.
Riodoce won the prize for her release in Latin America eight years after her release.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee of the Defence Committee, because of the fact that the drug story of Mexico's reputation has been suspended, and you're not allowed to leave me behind.
He admitted that he was afraid.
He said, "I want to live on."
In a report on Rompevinato TV, drug escape in Sinaloa said "a way of life".
"You must accept what has come down to you as a journalist, or you're playing this or stupid.
I don't want you to ask me what you were doing about so much death... why didn't you tell me what happened?
Riodoce's staff miss Valdez, and he's been teaching Confucian jokes, jokes, and friends who are proud of his advice, how he can live...
They trusted his routine.
He always put his hat on.
He went to El Guayabo in front of his office and sat on the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for his routine disappeared?
His death made it difficult for them to question their own beliefs about how they would do their best to live.
"If you attack their wives, their children, their clean works, their secret flying guns, they're not going to kill them."
Bojorquez said, "These things were limited."
As a result, even at the best of times, he had a high degree of self-defense and could not defend himself.
Trusting their own drinking.
If bad dreams are coming, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, director of the Riodoc writing work, said, "It's a tricky hearing... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and the others say that the old rules in Sinaloa are not valid, just as it is not fair in other countries that have run away from Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and a fierce conflict of power.
The earth is changing continually.
No cell phone is allowed in the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training; earlier today, he was only used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers out there wanted to be rescued from 104 degrees (40 Santrigrat) heat, in the shade of a tree.
Riodoce was appointed by the state government to protect the office located in a four-fold building in the middle of Culiacan.
Half-thirty, some of the leaders were wondering if the election was not reliable because some of the members said that the election was not reliable.
The months of the mountain crossing, which was controlled by drug dealers, came to be the months of the mountain crossing.
This week, Riodoce's three mother stories are rehearsing.
The former big boxer, Julius Caesar Chavez, had a murder in Sinaloa's brother.
In addition, there were government spending that had reached the electoral country.
And over a block of security, there was a group of Culiacan's worst-case restaurant.
There was no formal explanation of who was missing or how it was, so when the time came to write that everyone in the city knew that it was the director of the restaurant and the drug dealers and the office.
One of the presidential, official records has learned that the restaurant is registered under the name of a political figure in the Democratic Reform Party (PRI) under the authority of every last century's political party.
In recent times, many PRI governments have been accused of sexual misconduct.
Villareal asked the audience to write about events that had occurred before, including the flight of one of Guzman's sons, El Chapo.
Only months earlier, they had read about Valdez's history for the best source of information on escape.
He said, "We already knew what was going on before."
"Now all our channels of communication with our sources have been removed."
In the name of the press activists, the staff is again used as a repository to protest against the murders and expulsions of Valdez's office.
President Miriam Ramirez bought a couple of pankarts and went out the next morning for another journalist at the local lawyer's office.
Salvador Adame died three days after Valdez was killed in the state of Michoacan in the west.
There was a fake body, and according to DNA tests, officials say it's him.
In the course of the country, journalists, organized protests and buildings expressed their views in a higher voice by writing "Help to the Foundation."
Today, Director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in Washington, Valdez, far away.
At a meeting with the Sinaloa government on the morning of Valdez's death, Ramirez accused the press of having sex with journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that day, he wanted to take a different view than that of the government, thinking that his conscience was obnoxious.
Valdez continued to say that journalists in Mexico have been "reversed" by organized crime, criminal partner officials, and an unsuspecting crowd.
In his last book called "Narko-publicity", he wrote that journalists were killed, not only by drug dealers, but by politicians and organized crime, by order of their security forces.
The media surveillance group, Articula, has linked most of the attacks on journalists last year to police and police officers.
Ramirez said, "You die in Mexico because they want to stop you."
The murders have clearly had a cold effect.
No one remembers Maria Elizabeth Macias' northern border country in Tamaulipas six years ago.
Cessedi found a note that was signed by Zeta's cartel, saying, "I'm here because of my news."
It's a computer keyboard and a listening ear, with a broken head.
After the assassination of President Miroslava Breach in Chihuahua, the northern border state chose to close some publications, such as El Norte.
After the government was killed in 2004, the others continue as El Manana did from Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez, with his main head on the front page of the page, heard the drug cartels saying, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their countries, even from their countries.
It's a fucking decision.
It's hard to find a job in the summer, and they're still on their way, waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after the flight from Veracruz, four women and four women are held together in 2015 as photograph taken from Ruben Espinoza, an apartment in Mexico City.
It's a day-to-day dance with these high risk decisions for those who stay and continue to work.
Sometimes Ibara, who wants to be a joke, says she's afraid to tell her drug dealer about herself.
"Mexican is going to hell, and that's why I'm busy."
In the middle of the night, a very close comet, while the final number was getting ready to be completed, Riodoce was sitting outside the office, sitting outside the office and drinking beer, and he started playing his phone.
A number of armed conflicts, including border crossings and security forces, near Mazatlan, an area on the beach, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
He continued to rage as promised in a series of cartel messages on the network.
I think they put the cell phones on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have been changed the next day.
The sirens began to pass near, and there was another weapon around.
Bojorquez quickly looked up to see if they were on the tapes.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't show up.
The newspaper's novels were under the roof portraits of her middle finger to see all Sinaloa, and Riodoce's shirt was following her feet.
"How do you think you can shut up," Bojorquez said, "when the waitress wants me out on the day Javier was killed?"
He used a cupboard to avoid his enemies.
It looks like an animal at first sight, but it's a terrible thing.
Researchers have now explained that the first findings of the universe, which are now protected by a Canadian geologist, have been very well identified by scientists as ‘Mona Lisa’s dinosaurs.
It was so good that they could understand the red of money and say it's a serious story.
The report in the Current Biology report identified this as one of the best protected dinosaurs and among the best dinosaur species in the world.
Fossil, a new type of nodozor, who lived 110 million years ago in the middle of Kretase Dönemi.
The well-known condition of the island has turned it into a surprise to researchers who recognize it as a 'real miracle'.
It's the best known fossil found in its own kind, according to reports from National Geographic.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk found Suncor Millenium Madeni near Fort McMurray in North Alberta Canada.
According to his network, he shot something strange and decided to look closer.
He was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, 2500 pounds (1100 kg) of wild animals were transported out of the forest congregation.
It's just that after a slow job, it's gonna be ready to end up in the middle.
In the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Science, which you created, author Caleb Brown said, "If you're a little short of your eyes, you can believe you're almost asleep."
"It will be one of the best and best-protected dinosaurs in the history of science, Mona Lisa."
Researchers have found that, as far as it depends on its size, it is likely to be at a serious risk to the diet of this plant, which is likely to be eaten by dinosaurs.
He used his red and white cupboard to protect from very heavy dinosaurs, and used a protective technique known as anti-landation, which has been used for many days by our animals.
Researchers say that as long as it's called by larger dinosaurs, it makes it more likely to interfere with the environment and attack its enemies.
One of the 110 million-year-old nodozor families was born in May for the first time, and now it is held in the Royal Tyrrell Palace Museum.
Researchers have now completed their work and have given Mark Mitchell the name of Mark Mitchell, one of the team who spends more than 7,000 hours in a busy way to get him out.
This kind of amazing protection has been possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of sciences, with the design of money, and the detailed documentation on the body.
The animals have discovered the opposite opposite of a common form of defence in the environment, and the upper part of the creature is more vulnerable than the lower part of it.
Despite the spread of anti-smokers, the findings are surprising because the animals that live in Borealopetta's size are very popular.
This means that the dinosaur, by eating dinosaurs, has seen enough pressure, and that my husband tends to face it as a way of life.
But the most attractive animals (such as sheep, goats, sheep, or goats) that are used to fight against them are much smaller and more obvious to be a dog, which means that this nodozor has faced a serious challenge to survive.
Brown said, "Devasa shows how dangerous dinosaurs can be in Kretase, a heavy-duty wild animal."
And the chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the money also revealed that the red blood cell is a coffee.
To find out what people are eating at the end of the meal, they continue to feed their animals, including safe drinks, for the sake of life.
They believe that when Dinozor died, he fell into a lake and was driven to the sea, and that he joined the upper ocean.
By that time, Alberta, South Florida, had become so hot that it probably had more water and oceans than it is now.
Brown said, "Nodozor, it's really worth considering that the animal's original form has been preserved in a three-size way."
'So, as the animal looks in Crete early today, it looks exactly the same today.
You do not have the power to re-establish it. If you have your eyes cut short, you may believe that it is almost dead.”
Cretans were on two feet when the weather therapists, who were standing on two feet, were traveling to York.
Despite all the kings of Tyrannosaurus rex, he lived millions of years after a powerful dinosaur that might have been stolen by a team's wonderful fathers.
Among these are 38 ft (11.5 m) long and 6 tonnes of a cannazarus.
The latest findings in the Current Biology report convince scientists that Boraeopelta was transported to the sea after her death and was placed in the grave.
Born on 21 March 2011, in North Alberta Canada, the Suncor Millenium Madeni was discovered near Fort McMurray.
According to the museum, the most well-known and powerful dinosaur is not enough to escape it and its face.
A natural average of 18 ft (five meters) and a weight of up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two lines out of their bones are found at the length of 20 inches.
Researchers believe that they are now walking high in the land of West Canada, until they are driven by a flood that is caused by this burning fire.
But the dinosaur's table was described in detail by the perfect detail.
This particular type of fossilized remnants has been so well protected that the deep particles still cover the dust layers of the dinosaur’s head.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, it's not until he wins the piano.
The more I look at him, the more incredible he's.
Fossilized parts of the earth still cover the dot at the center of the dinosaur's head.
The right foot extends to itself, and the five fingers are straight up.
I can get the money on the foot."
Don't be deaf when I'm talking to you.
The white teeth and an aesthetic smile are the ideals of every person.
When people use different ways to make their teeth white, the Oral Laser Applications warn of the need to stay away from products sold on the market or on the Internet.
"The whitening of the teeth, the chemical material applied by the dentists or the porcelains attached to the teeth can be transmitted to the skin by the teeth in a way that it will no longer be changed," says Dr. Berk.
Berk notes that many diseases have prevented the protection of tooth health, and that the use of aesthetic applications and toothache and the ability to provide a good smile of mind are important to the public, and shares the following information:
Young people’s teeth are generally white unless they have a disorder or genetic factors in their teeth.
Because of age, the formation of teeth, and the use of tobacco, dehydration, or hairy drinks, teeth become more red in years.
The whitening of the teeth, with chemical substances applied by the dentists, or with porcelaines that are not applied on the face of the teeth, can be performed with minimal or unscathed porcelained ink.
The teeth should never be whitened with products sold on the market or on the Internet.
Because these materials are colored so that they don't turn back again.
Since 2011, the newspaper has been giving elderly, disabled, and bedridden guests "Home Health Service" from the past.
"It's been news of this service of my wife's pastry."
We've been looking for her, and they're coming.
He said, "I don't ignore my teeth if it's not for this service."
"My mother lives in bed for 7.5 years for the sake of age."
When I came to Bethel, I saw the parts of this service, and I called immediately.
We've been getting this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the words "very happy."
There is no need for health insurance for a service completely free of charge.
"Queda" in the Turkish army
My dear students, especially at the U.S. High Court meeting last day, made very interesting decisions in the light of the Marine Forces.
It's not a paramiliar, it's a security guard.
It's an application that's never seen before.
So how did this happen?
The Force Commander has completed the period of the Military Bünt Bostonoglu, and he's already going to be a hero...
And it happened.
Now the command order has come to the Veysel Kosele, the only airport.
In the past, he had to be the commander of the Veysel Pasha, who had been a champion of the past and who had been arrested for a while.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to tell you a very special story. If we start at least 1, 3, 4 and 5 command lines were not defined.
In this case, there was only one room in the Marine Forces.
He was to be brought to the release of the freed macaroni: the two-numbered Donament Commander of the Oral Veysel Centre.
So what happened later?
Colonel Adnan Özbal, who was in the sixth grade, was arrested by the government by the mayor.
Now look at this table!
He's standing there in the Army Veysel Tower, but he's wearing a lower-level command!
It's in the order of our commander.
What's going to happen after this?
A paramologist who is superior to Rühbez can't take responsibility for the order of an unhindered horgenerate.
He can't command, he can't.
In this case, the Veysel Kösse will not be able to stop this inducement condition, and if he is not loved by the embezzlement, he will be using it today or tomorrow.
And this is the message that has already been given to him by the government: "Listen to the voice of the Prophet!"
The news that he spent hours writing this letter yesterday was published, but the situation has not yet been explained.
Now let's see what's going on!
The government has come against the Veysel Council for this or that reason, it has not wanted to, it has forced its use, and it has brought into its place a security guard, and the army's future understanding of the future "Kadem".
There's a lot of politics in the job, but we don't know the back of it.
Maybe we'll always be together if we're going to tell someone about it.
My favorite lessons, I've tried to tell you very briefly above, especially that it's very important to be in the Turkish army.
It's not just a show.
For example, the soup that ends at 10th grade is more expensive than at 11th grade.
It's more important than the first order, the second time.
We've lived in Istanbul, the summer examples of this fate.
Garp Chief Commander Ismet Pasha...
He's got two hours in his name.
It's okay, it's okay.
We're here in 1922, and our troops will make a great deal of progress and defeat the Greek army.
There are valuable names to be expected to put in command of the army at this stage.
One of Rephet (Bele) Pass.
He's offered military command, but he says, "Religion is immeasurable, I can't go to his command."
Another name is Jacob Schevki Pasha.
He's at the Harp Academy of Atatruk...
He loved, valued, and admired "Hocam" a worthy and noble command that took place in various wars.
In 1919, soldiers and civilians were captured by Turkish light and sailed from England to Malta.
And when he comes back to the earth, we will ask him about the command of the army, and he will say the same thing: "The command of the Lord of the East is infinite, and I cannot command it."
But Father thanks him very much and accepts the command of one of our two troops.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A very speaking, constant soldier.
A command to fight in Iraq, Kafkas, Iran, and all kinds of warheads.
He's being driven by the English to Malta, from there to Ankara on the North.
When a military command is offered to himself, Ali Ihsan Pasha says, "I will not fight in the name of Ismet, who has no power over me."
But I'm sure...
But let's see, after the ceremony, the Garp Chief Commander, who is in charge of the mission, is constantly arguing with Ismet Pasha, issuing the case, and desecrating the army...
And it's just a short time before the big deal, it's taken from the job and it's in love with the embezzlement, instead of the Nurettin Pass.
After all, Ali Ihsan never repairs the bridge with Fathertuck.
The issue in the Turkish army is not only in the war but also in the struggle.
Of course he has to go.
The last example of this is the Vessey.
How did an activist find out the answer to the question "Who are you?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell died.
A day after he arrived to New York City, he sat in the bed of Airbnb, where St. Louis lived and started traveling on Facebook on his phone.
He's been waiting for someone from the school to share.
"Police killed a child at the age of 18, and he's still sleeping on the street."
He was surprised to discover that someone else didn't share this information in the evening, closed his Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoh continued to be tweeted in her inhalation.
The rap in St. Louis district, Michael Brown's death was a live tweet, and at the age of 18, an unarmed black and white police officer was killed in Ferguson Missouri.
That's where Brown, who's gonna stay for four hours, shared his picture of the immortal body on the street.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is crazy."
But death wasn't new to him or his group.
He left his phone, and later that evening, on the Canfield Drive, to return to tweets about people's gathering.
There were pictures of a man who said he was the father of the police, the people who were shouting, and Brown's father, who said, "Ferguson police killed my gunman a short time ago!"
A police officer was watching a live bird standing in front of a group of protestors.
In another video, another cop, he said, took his gun and cried out, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
Ferrell remembered saying, "It's not broken."
"It's not a kind of murder we're dealing with, and it's kind of typical."
I felt so proud of you.
I was angry and crying."
A turnout broke out, and the next day he went home.
He took his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go with him the next morning to Ferguson.
Ferrell and Ferguson will come to the cinemas in the following three documents, on August 11th, a new document called "The Soaks Whom?".
It's a story of the lives of the protest, love and loss, power and courage of the people who live in that community and who are looking for the answers to their questions.
Ferrell was returned to talk about "the trials of the peoples and the conditions of the political parties" when he was wearing a flower dress and traveling his vehicle with a suitable stone girl to Ferguson that morning.
"Do you remember what I taught you that the black people should fight for their faith?"
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a child at the age of 18, and that's not true.
I couldn't take it." He said later.
"Those who are here today... are the end of the past.
You need to know, see, and grow up in it.
Only when it comes to activism and organization should not develop well at the same time should we know what to do in order to free ourselves from the burdens and the political situation of political experimentation.
If I'm lucky for him to live as long as I can't try it personally, there's no difference between any black woman and child.
I feel like I'm going to do him some harm, protecting him from them."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they were the first to speak on the matter of Darren Wilson, who was in front of the police center and who was expected to talk about the crime that had not been committed later, and they were on the South Florencen Way for the activists, who had turned into a nevi camp area for the activists.
There, Ferrell and her daughter were contacted by local workers who were preparing a packaged food.
The counters were prepared and helped to reach the prosthetics.
Slowly, for Ferrell, it was formed a new type of activity.
While studying at Missouri State University, the University of Applied Sciences said, "My university turned completely after August 9 after the end of the year."
"I had no experience in caring for you.
He came from himself."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the film managers at the night show.
The teacher, himself and his own visual manager Lucas Alvarado-Farr said he wanted to know the end.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document it, or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This doubt was generally expressed by a person in a state of absolute whiteness; to come to a group and escape his pain and absence...
As Folajan explained in a recent report, "We have heard that the voices of people who grew up in Ferguson have not been touched, and we have decided to do differently."
He has already contacted Damon Davis, the director of a region that knows how to deal with the death penalty.
He was impressed by Ferrell's involvement in the project, and in the years following the attack by Brown's team, the other six districts saw it.
David said, "This is a record that no one can speak for us or speak for us; we are the ones who speak."
"This is the basic thing for me, how these people will be represented because it's how I'll be represented."
He said, "Even though not focusing on Ferrell's attempts, he said that his move was "not about a leader, not about the coming of a crowd," and he said that the film participants were the most open, so he talked.
As a result, "Water Whom?" is pointing out the personal ways of Ferrell's life, like being loved and married to his wife.
He said, "I felt like a rock."
"I realized that when you do this work and you're raising black people, you're going to have a lot of trouble."
Ferrell's story also enhances the role of Black Lives Matter in black and black sexual women.
In 2012, after the death of BlackLivesMatter, a young black Treyvon Martin was killed, two of his three cousins are recognized as homosexuals from the social media club.
"The black women in the leadership have generally taken the lead," Ferrell said, "and this is because we are still in a lot of fights.
The rest of the sexes must bear all the weight."
It was said, "Actually, black women and many black women are being caught."
And then Ferrell laments, "When this is nothing in the kind of action that happens," and when he's not chosen by his identity.
He says, "He was the one who used to move this energy."
"It's not a coincidence that he's in front of you, because you're going to lose a life in these parts as a black sexual woman.
You can feel its energy from the screen."
At the same time, news cameras in Ferguson have already gone, but there's a growing concern between the crowd and the police.
For two and a half years, I've been waiting for a Ferrell show to close the car.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area where my home is said to be the only word "carmasha".
He still holds the song that he remembered three years ago when he went out to the streets of Ferguson.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our job.
We need to love each other and support each other.
We have nothing but our sins."
Kyrie Irving: The world isn't right!
Irving, speaking to the NBC Sports, "The World's Not Influencing."
Set up the world.
They're treating people with fear of such things.
Oh, man, I don't have a lot of questions.
Because the more information you solve, the more information goes out.
That's crazy.
Is the world right?
Or is he coming back to his own place in a way that's in the middle of nowhere?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to us.
They are lying to us!
Irving, "I believed that I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was falling apart.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
There's nothing they're sending back.
He's not coming back!
The information they've given us is so unsatisfied.
It's real here.
You just need to call this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claimed the world was right, is fighting 24.4 and 5.9 assistants in the form of Cleveland Cavaliers this season.
A Versatile Comparison: The author uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room in New York Friedman Galleries, there are a lot of faces that look like white, black, and brown, almost all of them.
This 30-porter was created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who was sent by Chelsea Manning.
A 35-year-old volunteer analyst who was sentenced to 35-year sentence by the WikiLeaks post sent his missing clothes from the Fort Leavenworth prison.
The name of the new sergina that was opened in August 2 is Ménasip A Similarity.
This is an example of a two-year sentence between Barack Obama, a trans-wife and a former assistant, a man, who spent three days in a trial with Dewey-Hagborg, which was combined with computer science and engineering science.
We're analyzing DNA algorithms from Manning, and using this gene data to create 30-ports of Dewey-Hagborg, not only that DNA data can be used (there are many ways and determinations that can be achieved) but it's also difficult to identify who it is, perhaps with a little mental condition.
Bradley Edward, who was born as a more aggressive woman, was sentenced to 20 crimes in 2013 by Manning, under the Cassuluk Law, the computer fraud and theft.
The image was taken under the cover of the prison, so there was only one photo: I was sitting in the driver's chair, sitting on the sidewalk of Manning, sitting on the sidewalk, sitting on the sidewalk of a plate of dust, and sitting on his own.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was successful in the 2012 project with the launch of Dhaka Garip Preseszier.
In this, the designer created a smoke detector and a smoke portrait of what these people could look like.
He just got an e-mail from Paper Magazine right now.
"They were making a report with Chelsea Manning while he was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait that could co-operate with this writing."
It wasn't a visit at this time, it wasn't taking the picture, so they got to Chelsea and they asked him if he didn't hear about a DNA portrait.
The journalist and his prisoner, who had been in prison for two years, became close friends with whom we had not been waiting for many letters to change in the past two years.
Even Shoili Kanungo's illustration, the other one's punishment, and his personal vision of his brain, was brought out of the midst of a printed book printed by a cartoonist who could see his future as a person.
The fact that Obama actually wanted Manning's analysis of the book was a happy experience after seven years in a prison in Kansas.
When Donald Trump found new, possible ways to expand his internal divisions that he wanted to fight against the government, and for those who are under pressure from the government, there is also a deep and powerful thing about the process that is now being opened.
When all of this was asked about the weird timing, Dewey-Hagborg said, "The events are happening for a reason."
A writer who wrote on the wall called for the completion of the "science, race, sex and cultural "automatic separation" by Manning's husband's signature in the sizes of his wife.
There's a mitochondrial DNA sequence in front of the wall: many C's, G's and A's...
In addition to 200 letters (or nycleotides according to the sophistical science dictionary of the author), Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us how amazing it is that we look at each other.
"What I want people to learn from this, what we are about, what we are about, and what we're going to do with our genetic data." Dewey-Hagborg, in 2007, said.
"The DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and that's 30 of these stories."
A page of a short line from the short line that preceded the word in the last part of a room in one room.
This is Manning, the King Kong tradition, the United States of America, when it comes out of the disciplines.
"They've stopped your conversation, they've won."
"Don't ever stop with your prayers."
The composer from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter written to me."
"I'm still talking about it, and I'm still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the virus personally (as if he was buried in a very early form of cancer) but he will be greeted by the masks of his own genetic skills, which are collected as a group of protestors in the room.
Like everything on the surface, it was done in particular to the height of Manning (5-2, Manning).
Dewey-Hagborg, about portraits, said, "I used to put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a lot of them."
"I wanted him to be treated like a group of people who were represented by Chelsea, who was like the movement behind his release."
Northwester's educational mission and Oxford University's employee from China
The police told a high-ranking apartment in Chicago that after a man was shot dead, a man was officially called Northwestern University's educational mission and Oxford University's job was to start a man's flight to the country.
Cook's government records; the day of the trade shows that Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau was the first to be arrested for the murder of Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56).
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after he was shot several times.
In a warning published by the Chicago Police Department on 27th of December, he said there was a body.
The members received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments, and found a lot of deep inside the victim's body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau had been reported dead on the scene and the police were actively calling for two suspects to be shot by the detectives as a murder.
Latin, microbiology and immunology has been working since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, assistant of the university's contacts, said that he was authorized by Lathem and that he was charged with entering the university campuses in the Northwest.
Cubbage said, "This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and the University of Northwestern cooperation in this investigation."
Warren, he's an outstanding financial assistant at Oxford University.
"We are in touch with the United Kingdom police, and we are ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way they need."
She also told me that Warren's workmates were in shock and wanted to be obedient.
Chief of Communication from the Chicago Police Department said Anthony Guglielmi strongly urges the suspects to submit to the authorities.
Guglielmi said, "The police have ideas about where they are, but our efforts have not been met."
Guglielmi said he helped find the suspects from the local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a phone from the Grand Plaza building, who had received a secret impression that something was still coming on the site in 1008 areas.
The police identified the situation as very scary.
And he said it wasn't certain that the Guglielme case was on 27th of November.
Lathem and Warren said they were in the security cameras.
Guglielmi said, "We believe that the student is related to Latham."
The government administration of the square in Grand Plaza issued a statement saying: "Police is working on the timetable and history of the victim's past and researching a number of stories about possible domestic events."
Italy laid hands on the German ship
The Italian police explained that they were holding their hands in the name of the day Lampedusa.
The police, who also shared the records of their telephone conversations with journalists, reported that the operation was carried out during the investigation initiated by Trapani Security in October 2016.
"They have also shown their activity towards the illegal movement in Libya-Italia" suggests that the members of Jugend Retett, who have been ordered to take refuge in Italy from the boats of the Libyan human race at least 3 times, are bringing them to Italy.
Jugend Retett's members, who have been asked for security, are also among the allegations that they have worked with some people from Libya Sahel Security.
It has been made clear to them that their predecessors would continue to save mankind, and that they would be in respect of what they were charged with.
In addition to the ships caught by the Italian Security and the European Union (EU) mission, a civil society organization of about 9 countries is also responsible for calling for refugees in Akdeniz.
The Italian Government has prepared a document of 13 substantive rules of conduct for the conformity of these organizations and has called for them to be signed.
The last minute: the 5th anniversary of the Banley attack on the Grandfather
After the attack by the President of the City of Great Britain, he was arrested by the police, arrested by the police, and arrested by the police by the police, and arrested by the court by the five police officers who had been arrested by the TCDD.
According to the news report, the police and the Cevik Kivvet team have cooperated with the Beliad team in a number of ways.
Russian Vice-President Mutko: "We'll complete the WADA road map soon"
Russian Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the implementation of the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria would not take long to re-enter Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"A particular environment was completed when the road map criteria were applied, with the cooperation of RUSADA, UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping) and the right to plan and test.
WADA's road map has been updated in this connection." Mutko said on Friday.
The president, recently published on the website of the Congregation, assessed the second part of the WADA Management Board of the Road Map, which defined the criteria that the RUSADA is currently working on.
According to Mutko, it doesn't have anything to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been heard, it will all be applied.
The results will be secured to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
What is there is a criterion on the list; Russia's anti-doping agents, approved by WADA, say that the Russian lawyer Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer, has to accept publicly the consequences of the state-supported Doping polls reported by the government.
He said to Mutko, "When our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we're conducting a investigation.
All the wires are in place.
But there is no government programme, and we will not accept anything that is missing."
Mutko's words have been repeated by the Russian Anti-Doping Commission, Vice-President Vitaly Smirnov.
The Russian media agency Smirnov, who spoke to RSport in the early hours of the day, accepted the past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have many times said that the position and corrections that the report has created against the report include.
No one wants to accept the report at all." She added, "Smirnov.
Rusada was arrested by the WADA in the early morning of November 2005 by the Russian doping scandal.
What is more, national experts and United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD) have been authorized to design and coordinate this valuable test.
In December, after a visit to the general centre of Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli Rusada explained that he "progressed the right way" to resume his work.
100 million people were watching!
During the short-term "Come to Five" video that was broadcast by Peshiktashi, 100 million people from 18 countries arrived.
The video was also shared with the dialogues of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
Galaxaare doesn't turn the President's hand into an empty
Galatasararay, former president of Faruk Süren, made Dursun Özbek a harsh language for the transfer of the Prime Minister to Bukresh and Ndiaye.
Here are some of the special explanations that another man made for Sabah's readings:
Lucescu-Ozbek's interview, "When we left, we ended up."
Galatarian doesn't go to empty, and his hand doesn't return empty.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray is not going to football.
The footballer comes to the captain's feet.
Of course they know, they want to open their hands...
But whoever's a player, the president won't go to his feet.
You're paying $9 million to the player whose Osmanlyspor took $300 billion...
It's not 7.5 million. It's going to be 9 million with the bonus!
You've already made a big investment, of course you're gonna play and it's going to be 7.5...
I don't want to touch it.
It's your mother's business.
Mr.Saray's down to the ground.
It's not just football, I'm all wrong.
And whoever will change this is the devil’s Qur’an and the Noble Qur’an.
But the members are happy as much as I can!
Start-ups to help your company no later than Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of his work at the start-up, but the polls couldn't work.
The answers were generally unknown, without help or worse.
Some of the employees were not trusted for long, if they were to prove anonymity.
In San Francisco, Errett, a 75-person e-commerce company, led by Madison Reed, says, "There was no time to keep or to do anything."
And he called out for help.
A new kind of human resources are coming out to help companies understand how they feel about their work.
These are a software designed to measure the specific needs of workers and allow companies to make comprehensive optional questionnaires, target specific teams and demographic groups, set an anonymity and complaint aid lines for workers, and allow workers to pass on senior managers in some cases, and to be allowed to hear a lack of flexibility in the management system.
Glint's co-founder, Redwood City start-up, who measured the activity of software analysis tools by companies, said, "Now there are tools that monitor your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company Fitbit?"
Errett tells Glint's employees what he thinks and feels better after three years.
The specific groups are presented with a map showing which parts of the company are most concerned and which managers are less likely to be pleased with, so that they can be saved.
They begin to understand that companies must have information about the culture of their workers in order to be the next Uber; Uber, in a scandal that has been described in a blog published by a former employee, has been described as being punished by the media.
It's a very expensive job opportunity for start-ups like Glint.
The financial technology content website Let's Talk Payments provides global management, correction and compliance in the amount of $118.7 billion by 2020.
The relationship and activity of the companies to identify the bad behaviors and help the English people improve with the central startup-up Convent, which has contributed to Uber's uninterrupted negotiations this year.
There are close to 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convent allows companies to collect personalized "names" and to collect real-time hidden evidence and produce the map of the problem areas.
It also contains an anonymity line that could expose workers to their bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints are going directly to the administration.
Coverent's cousin and others, Patrick Quinlan, said, "The people's court has taken over the editors."
Quinlan said: If a company, if it behaves badly or does not act ethically to its employees, the editors may be able to cope with the resulting sizes, working habits, or cases.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant worker who works more than 25,000 in 500 locations, spends more than a year on informing Robert that his employees are first and foremost and that they are easily accessible to the company centre.
When he wanted to report a problem that had already been worked out, he had to find a phone number or e-mail in the company's office, he was in an official complaint, hoping he would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's main lawyer, James Vitrano, said that most of these were frightening and frustrating attempts, and that it was not a good way to follow the complaints that worked.
However, problems that are now being identified and solved by the company's use of Convent can be more quickly identified and solved by the authorities (such as discrimination, corruption or unfair financial application) who are previously in office, city or country.
Vitrano, managing the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday, said, "I can even get closer to this whole, 360 degree view."
"We also protect our senses against work."
In 2002, the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, took on more serious issues with companies, values, and employees in 2002 after the fall of the ethical values from Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But after "social media has come to themselves," the companies realized that they would not stop their inputs from being official.
He said, "Before technology was used to test reality, people used it as a strategy of hope."
Both Glint and the Converter software are registered as a service and are being re-used for the use of their products.
This is a model of work and opportunity that both start-up support the risk-up of investors.
Convent; Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital received $10 million in cash from companies like the Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and brought out the total amount of $47 million.
Glint made 10 million dollars from Bessemer Venture Partners in the list and brought the total funding to $60 million.
These investments are not surprising when it comes to the nature, culture, and risk factors of companies that relate to each other.
Further research shows that today's employees expect more than they used to.
High wages and interesting projects are just minimum requirements in the recoverable markets like Silikon Vadiz.
The workers want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time in a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, assistant of LinkedIn, who uses Glint as well as LinkedIn, said, "When people are happy to be in a company, they feel that they're heard and they're satisfied with what they've done, so that they can be successful."
Investors earn a fortune when their own portfolio companies do good work; companies, employees, and the company feel good.
If the third party analyzes the content and sense of those working in the analysis tools, it is not surprising that they find support.
It is important for cultural experts to have data on employment.
But the data won't work if you don't move the company's responsibilities.
In fact, a company can make a point of waiting for me to change if I want to report back from the employees.
And if it doesn't come fast enough or it doesn't, it can cause mental distress and it can feel as if the workers were lost.
Russell Raath said: "If you want 4,000 progress, you must be ready to speak in 4000 if you want to speak."
"Because if you don't follow, those who work will think, "Did you really hear me?
You mind?
And why should I care if you don't care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who made monthly reports, was able to move on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after I got back from the process of decision-making and the rapid recovery of communications quality workers, he was able to reorganize different teams in the company and add communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company takes new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in a long way, it will be able to keep more workers in this type of enthusiast that is well known to work.
Vitrona said, "If you don't have to create a magic culture, you'll lose people."
"And if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And when you lose your clients, you lose your company."
It's a long day for the NCAA to remove two coaches every day.
It's about 11 o'clock at night, and they're trying to chat on the edge of a new training team in the UCLA football team.
Some of the forms are covered up, and they're putting out of the dark of the first day in the school camp.
For an important part of the team, these empty minutes create a mid-day balance.
After three hours of training, he will return to his office and work on his final exams before he returns to the Waterman Football Center for the next meeting at 6:30 a.m.
The Bruins driver Jim Mora said just before he returned to the market, "It's a good thing for these people three days ago."
In order to remove the burden on the players, NCAA's two coaches were removed on the day of the NCAA, at least for at least five days until the end of the day, actually extended their days.
That's why UCLA's first three coaches are scheduled to start at 7.15 in the evening, in order to be in harmony with the heavy program of the players.
In contrast to the lack of two trainings a day more than a day; Bruins, according to the season of the start of the camp, is getting closer to a week, and during the sixth season of Mora's school in Westwood.
In the month of the month, Texas A&M plans to conduct 18 trainings until August 20th, before starting on official sports preparations for the openings against Texas A&M.
Mora, even though new people have added to the players' busy work program, he says NCAA supports the legal change.
Mora said, "For three or four days we will bring upon them a burden, and that is very difficult."
"And they've been through this for a very short time; they're working, wonderful children.
I think we'll have more time, and it'll be really wonderful."
UCLA will stop the coaches at the end of the camp; it's not easy to think that Luskin Center's hotel is extended to the front of the train station and the football pool at the end of the day, and it's not easy to find out that it's going to be off the road.
The Bruins player's planning to be in the room this week, but Mora admits that during the season, these rooms can be a problem with emptying them.
Mora said, "It's gonna be ours."
"It's not very easy to think that you're going to be a real worry and someone's staying in a room and sitting there and taking a training video.
If there's a video training record, it's a good thing.
But we'll be safe there and we'll be safe up there in 8 parking lot.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
increasing the power of history confirmation for the fight against Facebook fake news
Facebook's third party story provers will send more and more fake articles and show their findings under the original share; this is how the world's largest revolutionary social network is trying to compete with the so-called fake news on Friday.
In an explanation made on the company's website, she said that she would use updated machine learning to identify possible frauds and send them to the provers and that she would show the results of this story in a positive way under the original article.
Facebook is considered one of the main points of the news that many think that the US presidential election is affecting 2016.
Before the presidential election of the French electorate in May, a major political leader in Europe was also concerned about the failure of the anti-social media networks in Germany's previous elections in May and about the failure of the presidential election of the French electorate to remove the entire social media network.
In a separate statement made by Facebook Germany on Friday, he said that a test of authenticity of the new story was initiated in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su spoke on a blog, a Facebook news source, saying: "In addition to seeing what stories the third party has been discussing, she wants more information about what people have read and shared."
Facebook added that it will continue to test its "relevant article" properties and that it will work on other changes in the news to reduce fake news.
Line construction: The story of a Kale in England
In the near past, little Scotney Kales took place in a Swiss music club and became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in 1970 and 1980.
But right now, Jamie Rhodes, a well-dressed, historically written by a Yorkshire novelist named Jamie Rhodes, witnessed a life story of comfort in Kent's Bewl Nehri Valley, 700 years ago.
"I find it very nice to look at the hand of someone who has been dead for 300 years."
"How personal is it to keep this letter in my hand?"
In England, where Edward's turn extended to Central Chad, one of the families in Scotland was represented by a different artist (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
It's not the first book to listen to Rhodes's archive: He also wrote the Dead People's Days and Other Stories in 2014, which was inspired by stories in the British Library.
"My eyes were filled by a second agent who worked for the King James' side of the letter written in the 1700s."
"It's the ring of his head!
And the letters always smell because you caught a fire for the light.
For someone in the future 300 years, this smell feels like he's a soldier.
Ah, I love the archives!"
It seems good to receive support from the National Trust and the England Sanat Council as an old paper lover and be able to spend almost four months on a street (“I’ve had to be honest with myself for a little while.”)
In the days of Rhodes, the journey to Victoria through the "new" line, through the archives, and through hundreds of treasures and artifacts that have been mounted on the walls of the capital.
He talked to the curators, the speakers, and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of the book, and then he traveled through the fields and the ruins of the old street.
Then he was "swissed and written" at night.
National Trust is completely accessible only because the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
And when Rhodes came ten years later, he just started to take over the archive, and he described it as, "For centuries, aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it in the middle of the garden."
They wrote from the days of the English Empire: "You think the land's differences will be difficult," said Rhodes, "but there was a tree that fought over the two families.
Let go of me, man!"
In 1381, The Labourer, who left the newly built square to join the Church, used some of the stories in his collection as a clue to make a broader entry into the English history.
"Kent and Sussex have a record of what happened in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The great Jesus started out in this circle, and I thought it might be a good start point.
Maybe these two can be connected?"
Other stories are often related to the history of the street, such as The Priest, who told the story of Darrell's family, who kept a 7-year-old poet in English Islam.
Or The Smuggler, 18th-century fugitive, who was thought to be filling his grave with stones, took the place of The Smuggler, the 18th-century fugitive who was thought to have filled his tomb with stones.
Darrell said to Rhodes' most prominent Scotney family: "They always seemed like a nice structure, always spending money for things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have resolved their debt crises to marry wealthy women, and I imagine them as a group of decent people who are worthy of the creation of women."
Rhodes, on the way to the street, is looking for other touch writing experiments.
In the late 20th century, a senator's court, who had since completed a two-week job for a row of novels about Eljanmäki, reborn by nature.
But Scotney's got a different place in his heart.
"I'm sorry I left."
"Oh, now I have to go and face the real life that's going to happen."
Meral Akshener's "Maho's" game
The Millennium Movement Party has made a written statement on the notions of social media and press use in the recent days of the MHP.
He went on to play and play to stop the MHP's existence after 12 months of the National Movement, using the expression "some of the old clubs of Marksist" to MHP.
The mayor said:
"It's not the history of the Turkish people, it's not a criminal crime, it's a crime file, it's a conspiracy, it's a trick to move your hand."
"And now it's "MHP Head of the Regional Development Organization and 410 members and 215 members of the MHP Bursa New Year's Eve."
250 uses, like 300 uses, to mishandling the mouse with unexplained messages.
He's been lying in the newspaper columns, and he's been lying.
It's not like there's no use in our hands, but it's not about how many of the hostages in past places are going to pass through a hand prints.
The Great Catacomb, who is in the term "word" on the terms "word" on the terms "word" and "word", said that the boy was trying to be misdirected and managed.
He said, "The propaganda and the campaigns will be in violation of their return to the MHP in the wake of the MHP."
The MHP Secretary-General, who wanted to make MHP an important and unforgettable actor of Turkey's politics, said:
The former Marksists are not able to destroy the place that the MHP has taken over from the Turkish people.
All the steps taken are in lieu of an incoming account behind the methods of managing the applied revenue.
Because politics and the media have focused their attention on the MHP branch.
When we're together, it doesn't make any sense for those who don't show any good work and wonder what they're using now.
What's the problem with those who don't use their ideas from our party?
In their lives, they have not touched MHP, they have not shared our mothers, they don't understand our countries, they don't participate in our struggle, they've always helped us to live on the street, they've got to find other concerns for them.
The Millennium Movement is an effort to bring out the imaginations, competitions and behaviors of those who don't touch the whole party.
And he will certainly turn his back and strike his master.
The Millennium Movement is the last race of the people of Turkey, despite the heavy hits.
In his explanation, "the political hearts of the people who have achieved the goal of MHP," "the political prisoners," the Great, "the military movement is not without."
He said, "No matter what the cows' hearts are in, they will not reach their goals, no matter what their needs are."
The MHP President, who used the term "smokers will turn to madness and burn in the fire," said in a series of comments, "Chief parties and terrorists will be able to do anything from the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Persians, to the FETÖ from the PK, they will not be able to operate on their own behalf."
Day-to-day Turkey-free MHP, MHP-non-Turkey planners' new tactics and games; MHP-free government, MHP-non-MHP-non-MHP-Meclis-We've been fighting for the rest of the time.
And now we're gonna destroy the games, we're gonna kill the players.
He used the expression "MHP's patent, "MHP's patent, Meral Aksanner, who said, "I'm going to take the Maho villages to Germany, like a movie that I've ever made, and I'm going to take you to the end of the day, saying, "I'm going to take you to the side of the village of Maho, and I'm going to leave you on the side of the river."
That's their problem, but they're the only ones we want to go to.
Kjaer sent a signature to Seville
Kjaer, who transferred 12.5 million euros to Sevilla from the Laccived team, signed a contract with Kjaer, who was transferred to Sevilla, and was transferred to Spain's largest defans transfer in history.
The Danish star, she's going to wear a four-digit shape in Seville.
It's a lot easier for baby families than THY.
According to an explanation made by the THY Press Department, the air carrier continues to develop new ideas to try a perfect journey, which is designed to make it easier for passengers to fly and enjoy themselves while flying.
In fact, between 0 and 2 years of age babies and their families began to burn the "beautiful journey kite" prepared by injecting the needs of their families into the baby carriages between flights from August to August.
In the kitchen with a specially designed bag; the floor change plan, the single use mother's front, the swimming cream, the baby's lolliance and the shampoo, the newly renovated snowflake, and the sky's floor.
Paraben, alcohol, and other chemicals that are not harmful to the skin were produced in the presence of the substance of the baby.
Washington, Changing Green Card Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there would be a new U.S. transfer plan that would change the Green Card rules.
It suggests that legal immigrants fall to 50,000 per year, restricting rules for temporary work permits and family administration visas.
The new rules were offered by the Community and supported by the other.
The bill will be passed on both sides of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase debts, and make billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will change the way Green Card is given to other U.S. citizens.
The law will reduce the movement and take the place of the existing regime.
This new approach will benefit English speakers, the financial resources available to them and those who have the resources that will benefit us in the economy."
Writers captured the Fenerbach-Sturm Graz game
I haven't found it in two seasons, and I can't see it.
A "mangal hearty" team in the streets of the district of Kocaman was on the way to make a "stand with us" deal.
We can bring it to the game, to the positions or performances, but I haven't seen a game like this that's been working and calling for a long time.
The first game was made clear, but today's apologetics to their own rank; now Valbuena's commander at the Fenerbahce scene.
There was an old problem when it was transferred, but Kocaman's words had a "extraordinary character" meaning.
30 years ago, we gave him the name of the atom's wife to Rzya Challengbay.
If you win, it'll be the best way to get to the French player.
He was everywhere, and he joined all the passive organizations, took responsibility, and threw one hand into the air, and started to burn it.
Alper's play in front of the second stage left the Sturm Graz team in a long-term "fashioned" battle.
He called for a regular formula to break down a hard wall when he shut down the fenerbache circle from the corner.
They're a group judge, but they don't create an active passport in the area of a sort of rape.
This view can lead to a "need" path, but we're facing a game that won't lead to Ahmethan.
Either the team didn't trust a young player or it had to develop a little bit more performance.
After a score of 1-1, they couldn't get two net chances.
The tour was important, but it made it even better to take this side of the game to "gol" to the foot.
There'll probably be 1-2 more transfers until the market.
But the truth is, the biggest need for Fenerbach is the 12th...
We're in the middle of a very bright and beautiful season, this kind of game that drives the hearts of the tribals who try to play ahead.
He's building Kocaman's machine, he needs a little more time.
They're in good condition physically.
And the quality of the game is going to grow.
You're also seeing that all footballers on the street have increased their rights.
There's a lot of need for tonight's behavior for a new page.
The height of sex robots is real and we need to be worried
And when you think you can't go through 2017, there's a new report on the technological developments in the sex robotics sector.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big thing now.
In the past five or ten years, a report has been published on the progress of sex robots in the next five or ten years.
At Sheffield University, we need to take them seriously, according to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotic science and engineering at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eye, me, the shape of the fly, and the type of the rope.
Mr. Sharkey spoke about the release of the new report: "People laugh a little, but companies really love and we'll see them more."
Modern sex babies were married to robots, especially human beings, who had hot silicone, which was made by the construction industry.
Users can also personalize the robot's color, meme-form, and the type of paint or color of everything by selecting their robots to match their own blood.
But as many robots have "humans" to show a Stepford girl, that's even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies were married to silicone robots.
For example, RealBotix robots allow users to personalize their own robots according to their character properties.
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots with "Friit Farrah" and "Macher" who are developed by True Company.
True Company's website says, "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits you as much as possible."
I mean, whatever you like, he loves him, he doesn't like him, vb.
There are also spiritual conditions in the day, like real people.
It can be sleep, it can be willing to talk, or it can be in "time."
There are many disturbing aspects of the rise of sex robots: not only is it the place of real human relations, but it is the qualities of a woman who is more obedient to the personality, the competitive calls that approach Friit Farah.
On the Web site, True Company compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but it's for men.
"If she can be a vibrator (that's exactly what goes through), why aren't men Roxxxy?" the website.
What's up, these sex robots aren't just a party or sex players.
Their appearance and their complexity indicate a more dark and deep thing in our culture, and do not return to the sexual desire by elevating an optional addition from the ideal of gender equality.
Many men will naturally not find sex robots, and the FRR will continue to pay attention to their populaces, but they are now located in the outer courtyards of the country.
But flight crews can be a high-level teacher about the evolution of our life.
Many people, however, are not as strange or as insensitive as they are to be allowed to be.
It is not very unusual for women in white Saray to go out in the midst of a period when women's sexual rights are threatened by sexual assault on women.
The Handmaid's Tale TV series is the most impressive side of the screen, not the images, scientific instruments, or played eyes, but how real it feels.
Gilead is a big change, but it doesn't feel like it's a big change right now.
To create more physical similarity for real women (of course, in the presence of porn stars) to the extent that the goal of these sex robots is technologically possible.
They want their Creator to feel human beings as they do, and to imitate their movements of the real body.
But when the job comes to their "humanity," the robots don't clearly represent the real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
There's no activity or history, there's nothing to put their independence between, or anything to destroy the entire fantasy of slavery.
In other words, they are the chosen slaves.
Or by 2017: careers.
The U.S. Army Confederates: There are dead and wounded...
The country's foreign military forces were targeted at the attack by President Kabil in the Karabakh Valley.
1 NATO soldiers and 3 civilians were reported to have been injured in the explosion of their lives, and 5 of the wounded were wounded and 1 was a translator working with NATO forces.
In an official statement by NATO Support forces in Afghanistan, it was stated that NATO's forces were inflexible during a partnership with the Afghan National Army.
It was explained that the natural person was taken under treatment at the U.S. Army Hospital in Bagram.
There's no danger in the lives of the victims.
It's a local bomber who's supposed to be the Taliban's mind.
The big deal of Trump?
Show Mitt Romney as a symbol of a right
It was the fact that the political division of the U.S. electorate, which saved the U.S. electorate, divided the family into a microscale, became the reality of the Trump revolution.
The newspapers in the United States were filled with stories about Christmas and Thanksgiving about how the neighbors who played the trumpet to Trump were going to win.
We're all trying to expose our own filtering balloons to my word.
If you're less talkin' about it, it's the power of Trump's families to get together.
I appreciate this because my cousin, who lives in Chicago and is in the midst of our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that association with an enemy could have a powerful effect.
Everyone who has known for ten years about the politics that Trump has been dealing with in the White Saray takes the same side, both individually and in a strange way.
It's a good thing at dinner table tonight, but it's so good for me that these important risks are on a broad scale.
Sol, it was inspired by Trump, but it created a right to kill for everyone.
When we're talking about "normality" and Trump, one day we're talking about the fear that her weird behavior can no longer shock.
There's even a much more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes the healthy citizens against its own standards" and they seem to be a sign of your understanding.
I find myself living in nostalgia about Mitt Romney's madness and the version of his life: the dogs on the side of the car, the 14% tax (but at least we knew what his tax was like) that both of them are really very poor criminals according to Trump.
When the flurop goes, the next Communicator has to be on the top of his mind to evaluate the progress you've made.
When we took our children to the airport in Central Park, you need the biggest and the best papers you can spend in the city when you work by the New York Parks Department.
The horses are huge, centrally cylindrical fiberglas designs (all of them come back to watch with fear from their own eyes) and the music that's so loud.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city may be disillusioned: High buildings are beginning to come to a sudden end, the flood line is beginning to become known as not creating too much excitement, and the city is not going to fall to the truth.
Thirty-five years ago, and I still didn't come to the top of the day I discovered that there was a widespread conflict in Northern London, not a Swiss Cottage.
What's happening is, when you're flying in Central Park, it's still a strange experiment, so two men at two years of age, a man at 11, and two women in 40 can go here and all can spend a lot of time.
If I could give him a note, I'd give him a full note, but no one would ever ask for a thank you.
On the other hand, I was asked to evaluate my "test" between 1 and 5 stars this week before I passed the credit card.
The same thing in the coffee shop at my side of the street, and a note with a 15-year-old relationship; for what you bought quickly...
This effect is not only slowing down the need to be a free trade but also pressure to obtain a person who is not needed on the server at the same time.
When a poor woman in Bonmarsche's feet were cut off as a divorce, I, in the middle of the pregnancy, gave five years to try to give her a credit card.
They're wearing the mahogany after 41 degrees.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of my life, the people had spent their lives on the Munzur beaches.
With good pressure from the hots over the hours of the morning, he tried to protect the young, young, old, women, and men from the cold waters of the Munzur River.
In particular, in such countries as Germany, the Netherlands, France and England, the Tunisian peoples who live in the countries of the Ege or the Aqdenzi region have lost their beaches on the border of the Munzur Square.
The Suna Tosun, who took place among the pilgrims on the Munzur Square, used his choice for the west of the island for the last few years from Tunceli, saying, "I didn't want to celebrate in the west, but it was right to be in our own villages," he said.
"Munzur's water is no place in the world, and Munzur's watching us in these heats."
In Germany, the Hasan Major said that instead of Chechnya or Bodrum, they preferred the Munzur Square in Tunceli, and that is why they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital with brain pain
This is the second time that Pistorius left the hospital to visit the hospital.
He was taken to the hospital for the treatment of the cancers in the cars he said he was coming to the hospital after they had been in prison.
Pistorius had been sentenced to a death sentence, after which he was sentenced to the death sentence by the soldiers.
In the early hours of March 2013, Steenkamp was killed by fire at the house in Pretoria by shooting a mob at the door.
Pistorius said he was in contact with someone who did not invite in on the night he was hiding his girlfriend.
The prosecutors said that this time they thought it was so cheap that Pistorius was once again intent on retiring against the six-year sentence.
The U.S. Army said he would refuse to the Supreme Court of South Africa and this year can be assessed.
Pistorius, if the fighters succeed, they'll be against being sentenced to 15 years.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
First match profile successfully completed
The Dictator's organisation of the Presidency has succeeded in bringing prayers and prayers to Saudi Arabia to the Apattürk Airport in the Outbreaked Terminal.
In front of his first hack profile, he was involved with relatives, with about 200 relatives around him in the Eastern Hemisphere Terminal.
On the other hand, the Turkish Airways (THY) were divided into eight villages, and the city was divided into four villages.
And the Haqq chapter in Ankara has succeeded in Esanbog.
In the Capile, the first time in this year, the city and the gas neighbors were also replaced by the unregulated application of the newspaper and the city's neighbors.
Two Bulgarian-based Camp Builder Stored in Greece
According to the explanation of the Foreign Ministry's statement and received by the BTV, two Bulgarian-based camps were arrested in Greece.
Two Bulgarians were arrested by the police on August 1st.
They were left the same day as the investigation continued.
The Foreign Affairs Bureau told BTV that Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have slowed down the controls on the base camp and still have severe punishments for those who are caught in places not separated for that purpose.
I'm gonna run the controls all along.
The lawyer said the court could punish him.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to spend the month with his two friends in the early summer.
The car they hired killed Adana and Mersin, and he disappeared in Silifke on 8th of December.
His friends who came with him, despite all the calls, told Hoffman's family in the Netherlands before he met Hoffman.
And when the police were on their way to find a lost tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei went to Jaymy Gewald Adana.
ILANLAR BASTRIP DAYS
Robin Hoffman, who's in charge of the police here, distributed the missing items to Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman told us that he had received news from his brother at the last 8th of December, "We had a police station in the Netherlands first."
Later, my two friends and I came to Turkey and joined the police here.
We haven't got any news until now.
He said, "We'll stay in Turkey until my brother gets a message."
Welcome to the Second World Trade Center
In Russia, the 2017 Paletite Youth in the World Championship was the world's second world over 400 meters above sea level.
Young People and Sports Officer Osman, you're in love with the message he's released, and you're in charge of a silver medal that won by Aishu Ceren Yeshilbach.
In Russia, the first day of the 2017 World Championship, Ceren Yishilbaş became the world's second world on 400 metres.
Ceren, taking his place in the great performance he showed in the park he fought with 8 finalists, lost his gold medal with only 27 cents.
When Elena Lopatina won the gold medal in 400 meters at 03.18.73 minutes from Russia, Ceren won the gold medal at 03.19.00.
Turkey represents eight men and eight women on the championship.
The last words were, "I think I'm going to die, Mom."
"I don't want to die, Mom, it's not fair."
"I thank you for everything you've done for me," said Italian Gloria Trevisan, and his lover.
Among those who were not informed about it, Gloria Trevisan and Italian lover Marco Gottardi, who was 26 years old, sat on the 23rd floor of the 24 - floor building.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer from the Trevisan family living in northern Italy, heard that two boys had lost their lives, according to the information they had made from English adults.
The lawyer who wanted the families of young people to live in misery asked them not to hesitate to explain the matter to the journalists.
I think I'm dying, Mom.
The lawyer Sandri, Gloria, said soon after the fire came out, her mother called Emanuela Trevisan on the cell phone and she heard her mother's last talk.
That's why Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother a couple of times after she started at 1:00 p.m. when she started at 1:00 p.m.
Trevisan, who was the calmest of the first conversations, said, "Mother, there's bad things happening here, the fire's gone."
We're stuck, we're not getting out.
There's a bit of a panic, but don't worry, we're waiting for rescue.
"We tried to get out of the door quickly, but there was too much noise, and the elevator wasn't working."
The last words of Gloria Trevisan's attention to the growth of the tongue were quoted as follows:
Mom, my whole life is passing before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
There was a life I would have lived before; that's not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't kiss you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, Mom.
I'm going to Paradise now, and I'm gonna help you out there.
This is an error of the Italian government
Both Gloria Trevisan, a rural education teacher, and his beloved Marco Gottardi, who had been working for the past year, were forced to move from the Veneto region north of the country to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who found a 300-euro loan job in his country, began working in London, a short-term 1800-year-old (about 2060 euros).
Lawyer Sandri, Gloria Trevisan's family had a hard time financially, saying, "Gloria went to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people need to save their future and leave the country to find work.
"The government must find an immediate solution to this problem."
Italy’s Dream That Does Not Give Children a Job
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also asked her daughter, "This is the fault of our government that forced our young people to flee to find work."
In Italy, when the unemployment rate reached 12 percent, there were 40 percent of young people in the past.
In the past few years, many young Italians have begun to move to the countries of Europe to take the lead in England.
Last year alone, the number of young people who had to leave Italy was 110.
Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi have also been identified as the drama of a country that is unable to afford jobs to young people in Italy.
Reduces red, cold products and chocolate IBH
Rediscover it and it can turn into a hole for your chocolate symmetry system.
But a new work implies that a rich supply of protein and milk products can help to reduce the health of those who suffer from diabetes.
In the United States, 1.3 million and 300,000 people are affected by this untreated state of health, which is caused by cramps and cramps or blood clots, kilograms and excessive weight loss.
Researchers at Washington University found that the basic amino acid triptophan, which develops a stable layer of moisture, is a key factor in the development of the amino acids of the protein in the Washington University.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that he traveled to the nests to prevent the insects from entering the body from entering the body.
The cells that are able to stimulate the transplant are compared to the cells that encourage it to stop protecting the diseased tissue without harming it.
If the liver is too much to swallow, it can result in the disease.
In the trials, there was a sort of humour that caused a specific bacteria to develop resistance in the rats that carried a specific bacteria in their shells.
And the bacteria need a triptophan, one of the protein structures, which is one of the rocks in order to stimulate the interlocking of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have linked the growth of the urea population, which is a part of the microbiology, with a type of bacteria that enhances stability with the Lactobacillus ureter."
The more triptophans in their guts, the more they have their own bones of pity.'
If there's the same thing in people, L. Reuters and triptofan have been found to develop a more stable, less flexible environment for the rich.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragandas, a postdoctor, found that while working on a type of charity that develops sustainability, a group found that the test party had these types of cells, but that there was no other group in the same place that was held in different places.
The difference was that it was about bacteria, viruses, and mandarin populations that were normally living on the mid-highway canals.
Farer's lungs were made of DNA sequences and there were six types of bacteria in the cells in which there were no DNA, but there was no need for them.
The L. Reuter was given to patients who had a severe microbial deficiency due to exposure to steroids and who did not develop this type of convulsions.
Researchers have expanded L. reuter in the heat to understand how bacteria react to their immune system and then transferred to less than a dozen non-fatal bacterium cells taken from the walls.
It turned into a form of cells that stimulated stability in the bones.
When active coagulation, indole-3-activative acid was observed, triptofan metabolism was one of the most common ingredients known as indole-3-activative acid.
Researchers estimate that when the triptofane levels in the brains were doubled, the number of cells increased by 50 percent, but the triptofan levels decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people had the same resistance to rats and that most of us had L. Reuter L. in the mid-term channel.
It's not known that the triptophans from L. Reuters do not develop in humans as they are in the wild, but in people who have been infected with triptophan-related disorders.
He said, "It's something we'd like to encourage the development of these cells because they control the inner layer of the cells.
It is potentially due to the spread of this population at high-level triptofan in situations where L. Reuters is present."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a 'dangerous' with Nemanja Macic.
After the middle-class player went out in front of Samdoria on the night of his first show, Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "dangerous" with Nemanja Macic.
The transfer of $40 million from Chelsea began at UEFA Super Cup in Dublin, just the day before the last season of the United States, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in a position to be in a position to restrain them.
What happened was that Maviler's previous season in Asia had a serious stomach condition that left him out in Asia, and only 45 minutes before the Mourinho Premier League season began, he acknowledged that this should be improved.
Mourinho said, "There's a need at the moment, but my effort, my mind, my mind... is thinking about football."
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
When the Mourinho season began to take shape for the first 11th, like Macic, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romel Lukaku and Aviva Staddi came out of the game.
The Independent concluded that this week Mourinho still wanted 3 more transfers, but the club already realized its own three-thirds of its four priority transfers and concluded that it was "a sexual act" that made it possible.
He added, "Thank you for taking the fourth grade."
"If they get four, I'd be happier, but they've worked hard for me."
Last year 197 people were sent to the hospital
According to the Council of Social Affairs, in 2005, the number of sexual misconducts involving 1 person rose to 8 percent in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren was diagnosed with an increase of 197 children and young people who had been sexually unhappy during the past year.
In the same hospital, a child psychopathist named Louise Frisen said that he could be derived from becoming a more open society, saying, "It can also be regarded as a general development in an open society in which sexual issues are involved."
Sexy intolerance is known to have no connection with sexual intercourse.

Guide a worm around a maze of white-eyed tax authorities
According to the military records of the TIME, a total of up to $24,000 was made available to the owners of a ship's shipyard in the south for an organization promoting the formation of the United States of America last month.
When the president arrived, Marine One was also known as the Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, in White Saray on 17th of December.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and prominent White Saray members traveled through the productions of 50 countries.
A helicopter built at Connecticut, a bed from Main, a truck from Wisconsin, and a Forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the team responsible for the helicopter's operation asked the white Saray Harp Dairesi to submit his presence to the helicopter's "unresponsible" organisation only 36 hours ago.
HMX-1's command, a day before the Air Force Commander Vekili's organization, "I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of it because it's a highly visible organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter's south wing would come for the 3rd organization at 7 a.m. and that it would stay between 6 and 9 in the evening.
Nott, if he's late out of White Saray, he added that he would need a second flight team to get back from the hours of duty.
While a security officer was in the airport, he was on helicopter during the original flight schedule.
It's not clear that the second flight plan was not necessary as a result of any of the records provided to the TIME.
The Hatch Act is a guarantee that the government will use its assets for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 is asking that the organization has not complied with this condition.
It was written in the form of "a question we're dealing with is that we didn't break the Hatch Law and we're not told."
"It looks like you're locked up."
The "Made in America" organization has been designated by White Saray as an official organization and does not enter the Hatch Law.
But official organizations are becoming political leaders.
The president of the organization, then the health services that continued at the Senate, changed their efforts to reform and made efforts to disseminating the government's reforms.
The use of Marine One or Air Force One as well as the use of air transport as an alternative to policy objectives is not a new event.
The presidents must use these to travel.
But it's not that they're supposed to be used as an official excuse for taking a photo.
Trump, the presidential plane of Melbourne, Florida, was taken into account when the first campaign went to the back of the mything scene, and he was taken into account in the presence of messages on the use of the presidential plane by the Twitter account.
The White Saray press assistant Lindsay Walters said: "The White Saray is excited by the production of "Made in America" of products made by American workers from all 50 countries."
HMX-1 regularly conducts training flights in Washington, U.S.A., and in the south, trains the U.S. President to leave the White Saray at once.
At the beginning of Trump Temmus, HMX-1 was in Germany for the G-20 ceremony.
One expert said that the flight for the Made in America organization, the air traffic controller, was counted for the training required within that month.
One helicopters flew 11 hours that day for "non-primary support tasks".
White Saray said he didn't take any other number in the tax authorities' organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said that the helicopters were not involved in setting up the installation of the helicopter's solar system.
HMX-1 doesn't keep records for the presidential flights, and it's hard to detect the firm departure from the organization.
But according to the 2017 financial year of the Defence Force, the Defence Force's VH-3D flight area is $24,340 per hour.
First records record the flight duration of the air transport from the centre of Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia to 30 minutes straight.
White Saray says the helicopter's real business route is very low.
Walters said, "It's a great mistake to take a trip to the owners of the press, taking the chances of getting a job."
"It's a personal, looking, and a year's journey."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Defence Department does not include personal routes, but it does include heat, sight and contract routes.
At that time, White Saray's former press spokesman, Sean Spicer, was defending the use of helicopters for this organization.
Spicer said, "This week, I'm here to clean up what's done here in America."
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of their national security contributions, and I think that even though thousands don't, hundreds of people are involved in this.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military teams that many Americans, like most Americans, work hard to make.
And indeed, it is proper to take it into account."
It's not just that I didn't get in touch with helicopters when Trump's solar clocks for the organization, but it hit the driver of a plane.
In White Saray, Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives about the products of the company in his own philosophy with the media.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well." He said, "I have three of them."

According to B.M., the political role of Afghan democratic women
B.M.'s mission in Afghanistan was told on Wednesday that the elections could represent the role of all members of the group, including women.
B.M. Assistant Head of Mission Nicholas Haysom says that hundreds of women competed in municipal councils, fought for the aid of three women, and had more than 30 percent of new registered voters.
He said on Wednesday, "The role of women doesn't matter."

GMB interest rate in the Glossow factory of McVitie's
A trade union wants assurance from McVitie's manager of a long-term certificate of production in the Glasgow factory.
GMB Iskoshi told the company that it was silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross area.
In addition to the other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea are working more than 500 people in the factory, where Hobnobs and Rich Tea are made.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've spent more than five million stars in the last few years in the region.
He added that if there was a change in operations, workers and union representatives would be "intellectually informed."
In a letter to the company's core manager, GMB Iskošia asked McVitie's "to go through the concerns of not providing a fund for the modernization of indigenous groups."
Drew Duffy, the GMB-based organizer, said: "It is a serious concern that our members cannot see a balance in terms of the general need for work and the future of Tollcross's investment plan.
For generations, families are working here and in a situation where there is a lack of labour in the local community and in a situation where there is high unemployment and a high level of social unemployment, with sufficient demand for critical support.
When it comes to employment, financial and financial prospects, the Brexit approaches, further transitions and the chronic decline in production, require four times the existence of a mammoth in the village of Glasgow's native McVitie."
A woman from Pladis said: "The base manager in Tollcross has received a more daily letter from the GMB Iskoshija and the company will give our appreciation to the union representatives.
Two months ago, working at Tollcross and with GMB representatives, we held a regular meeting that discussed a few problems clearly.
Then we told our employees, like all the companies that work in an uncertain economic environment, that we'd be able to get a recorder, that we'd keep track of our operations on track for all these things and our foundations.
He added: "In those years, we spent more than five million stars on the Tollcross test, especially on production bands and operational development.
We fully know Tollcross's legacy as a production gene, and those who work for any change in our system operations will be the first witnesses to their syndicates."
For more than 4 years in the Bee and Otku
The five-year-old club, the Neptune and Utku Yuvakuran's speech lasted for four years.
On the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) on the website of the Turkish Football Federation, it was seen that Bešiktash had made a deal with two players until 31 May 2021.

Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar's departure?
La Liga may have been sorry about Marco Verratti.
In Paris, Saint-Germain, 189 million free-of-charge bids for the release of Neymar, did they warn Barcelona about global warming three years ago?
The Ligue 1 team, Paul Pogba, moved to write the world transfer record over two of the more than two times before he returned to Manchester United during the course of his 89 million years.
The PSG, with a weekly loan of $50,000, shows that Neymar will be the world's worst player and the most winning professional sport at the same time when the transfer is completed.
Although the management of the Catalans is a close source, despite the fact that the club from Santos has always insisted on doing its best to listen to him, it is known that Barcelona is angry about the way the offer is going and the way the Neymar is going.
Well, was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City Blaise Matudi expressed his interest in signing in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif made a strong warning to all the clubs that wanted to sign to one of the best players in PSG.
Al-Khalafi said: "I am not concerned because they know that if they attack one of our players, we will attack them and they will attack us."
"We respect all the schools.
But if they refuse to sign one of our players, they will be among the losers."
The Spanish club in Barcelona, at the beginning of this letter, seems to have opened this line by expressing interest in Marco Verratti, the PSG middle-class player.
PSG indicated that the Italians would not allow any conditions to be separated, and Barcelona feels better about losing Neymar from its greatest value.
