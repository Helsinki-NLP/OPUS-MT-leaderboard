I've never fished with Tom.
Tomo thinks it's a mistake.
My daughter likes summer fruits, for example, cheeses, watermelons and Persians.
I won't forget that.

The next day he was found dead in the bedroom.
We've always paid in Germany with travel tickets.
I know what you did in Boston.
If you can't enjoy your solo, you can't enjoy the association with someone else.
We have to wait for Tom.
They died after each other.
No one can stop you.
