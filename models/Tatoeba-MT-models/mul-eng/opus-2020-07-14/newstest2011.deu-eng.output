What should they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague don't know the full place or the "Conditoirei".
The new rapporteurs of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to fully understand their old and new colleagues from the ODS in Prague and the city.
The newspaper Aktualnná.cz has been a little "responsible" since members of the new Council of the ČSSD once again, as they have ruled the notorious Slang that has been in the past years, in which today's coalition partners were in Prague am Ruder.
The coded word form, introduced in the late era by the mayor of Oberburger Bém by the Prague political elite, is derived from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new lines in relation to these new terms were missing something in the dark.
At least they claimed it.
"Who's the place of the Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I'm more a neuling in the Prague policy," said Lukáš Kaucký, the new rapheir for culture, to the test of the "paten dictionary".
But also the Rasher Karel Brézina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "Goldlock".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I go in and use again."
"At least I don't hold much of Slang."
From the words quoted by the newspaper Aktualnö.cz in June this year before the ODS election, the edition quoted six terms, particularly those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Masterate.
Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Greatest Prague Golfloch", "Go to the Constituent", "Steerarchs", "Verrat des Maint" and "relative".
Three Prague Rakhherren agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague School of Education - promised his first participation in the conversation, but did not even take the audience off.
The fifth Radherr, Petr Dolínek, started the test from the front.
"These things are mine, and as citizens' democracies hold together, I do not condemn them."
"It is important for me to understand how we understand ourselves under our programmes," he said.
As already noted, Lukáš Kaucký had apparently not recognized the speech of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janousek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing, and the only concept he got when it was tested correctly was "the biggest Prague Golfloch".
"This is the tunnel Blanca," says Kaucky, adding to the security: "But I know it better from the newspaper."
And he laments, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Goldloch" will then be issued not only by Matador Karel Brézina, but also by the Council for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanca.
However, both social Democrats also know who the concept is of full-time and Lukáš Plachiy knows where to find this figure and therefore what it means to "go to the conditionalaire".
"I think that's what it means to go to some Prague gastronomy business," Plachiy is quite close to the solution to the puzzle, if you know it's about the meeting of Janousek companies.
In line with Brzezina, however, he meant that he would have acquired these knowledge more from the newspaper than that he would own this word.
In fact, among the social Democrats, it does not seem to give similar citizenship.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is nothing like this in us."
"We call us by name, here and again we also use kürzel or spitzname," says the president of the Prager ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party-owned salope "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bríza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me so," Karel Brézina tells us his name.
The Zeitung Deník Aktualná.cz has tested the names and see that - it works.
Ratherr Weinert is a friend of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Opa" of the "Older", of the representative of Miroslav Poche, who made the election by the companies at the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igraček" (known Czech Lego figure).
These are the only names that allow social Democrats to speak in their own language.
Hulínský may not appear to have been called "Hulda", but Deník Aktualnné.cz also registered another title of the president of Prague.
His Spitzname "Doctor of the Gummicnipüppel-rights" is likely to do so that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to connect the folders of "Hexen" and released a brochure
Women who are expelled from Burkina Faso to Hexen usually display some common social features.
They belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are empty and they do not have children.
When one of these women goes to Hexe, she is severely isolated so that she can't be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this channel."
"You young and healthy women also have this in mind as they help and bring children to work," explains a sister in the capital city of Burkina Faso in a special home for over a hundred women who have been displaced from their communities.
The local government has now decided to oppose this abnormal 'social action'.
And for this reason, a brochure was published that should link the "Hexen persecution".
But it's got a hack.
"More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" showed on the dilemma of the written statement.
However, the Hexire is also going and going in other African countries.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they handed them over with Petroleum and simply sinned.
This event was reported by the BBC server.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would have been only a setback of unfortunate circumstances.
Your version will then blow oil, which will be used for ritual healings.
And indeed, after the group tried to "an evil spirit" from the woman "to depart."
The isolation of "Hexen" supports the people here without turning back on their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Fresing human souls is a danger as it is today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to eliminate Hexenjagd, the Gambian President has been fully co-ordinated in the past year by the President himself.
"After the death of his aunt, President Yahya Jammeh ordered a monster hexenjagd, as they were supposedly part of their deaths and would now try to bring the presidents themselves through black magic."
"He called for help from nearby Guinea, who, in the presence of police, soldiers and the president's leadership, took women and men violently out of Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Canilia," Amnesty International, in her report.
On the farm, the oppressed people were forced to drink a waste of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused damage to Darm and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the farm's stay.
As a result of international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A renter from Babala: He calls in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older supportive man just leaves the client centre of RPG byty of the "Kohl baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments in Chechnya.
Under the arm a map with three new rent contracts for three apartments: for the own and the dwellings of his daughter and his son, who is just a haircut.
All three were raised within the framework of the so-called "deregulation" just increased the rent.
Instead of 3500 kronen months' rent, the son will be charged in the next year for a 2-room apartment with the kitchen of the second category 4400 kroner.
"And there's no floating hot water in the apartment and here you need to be in a simple refrigerator," he touches with the finger on the new rent contract of the son, whose signature he has a full power.
"But what - I signed," he declared half-consisted and half-resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Association, which called the new conditions "inaccurate and immoral", is able to not simply sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, in which it considers an offer to be made to such contracts.
But the man's only waiting.
"One says this, the other says it," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region will thus become the major deregulating laboratory.
After the new year, this deregulatory is preceded by most dwellings in Chechnya, whose tenants have not yet paid a proper rent.
Currently.cz therefore decides to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG space in Haviřov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full of nine in the morning on this day of service.
At the same time, along the door, the bodyguards are a security agency and an alarm device with her.
"Miete 2011" thus lights a special keyboard field on the touchscreen.
The device has recently been typed and has already been pumped out of a number space.
Soon we have removed the number "157" and already punctured it on the large display at the roof of the room.
One and a half seconds later, you're on the line.
Some time later an older couple joined the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the tension in the waiting room is obviously not even the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the common problems - repairs, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November in the Ostrava region, Kuverts, with the new rent contracts, opened most of the 44,000 residents of the RPG portfolio in the letter boxes.
RPG Byty suggests in writing an increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The special key for the new rentals in the customer centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs something over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies answered behind the locker after a moment when the "Client" went out as a journalist.
Deregulation and balalas former mountain work apartments are a fragile theme.
Before the elections, the President-in-Office of Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, had raised this issue quite satisfactorily, no wonder today the newspapers are full of it.
"For forty years, I want a new footing from them."
"Never mind. WC-Brills could change them," says the man mentioned at the outset.
So far, employees are increasingly on the switch to ensure that they are actually receiving the promised rent adjustment promised to them by RPG if they sign the special offer at the time.
In the interest of a half-member of February, the other tenants who signed the new rental contract should also come to the benefit of the rest of them until 15 December.
So far, "deregulating switch" is in Haviríov, but everything else is beyond questions.
"Only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were from the top 360 customers," the Schaltermans estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and wall tables where necessary.
However, the parties should not rely on the new rent, they shall be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but it is as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal practice," RPG explains on its websites.
"There's nobody going to court," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street before the client centre is at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (Kronen) interest, which remains 5,000 for food, where I should take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employees will be uncertain.
"Don't see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and thus wait for the people to come out," she continues to wonder.
The regulated rental ends in the largest part of Czechia in New Year 2011 and RPG Byty follows the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimès, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty, and - just the cancellation of the housing fund criticized by the rented tenants is in the view of the owners of the main basis for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the single rents between 2005 and 2010, it was expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the deck, a few red-lighting information is always available in the Havírov Warterium.
"The rent increases in 2011 amounted to 15% and less than 31 200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG's dwellings."
"This always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," is to read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 per cent.
"In these cases, it is about an increase of extremely low rent prices of 19,66 CZK per square metre", argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments the rentals remain at the same level in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push the rent to the height, but gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company has an additional obligation: all revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to be re-entered into the apartment, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heating.
But, above all, these people should be allowed to sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw one - the office is also a child garden.
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.design.
But who would have expected a minikinder garden here, with all that is involved: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-game space on the outdoor terrace.
These children's gardens have been available for the staff of Arch.design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the Ateliers produced a series of famous brüner buildings, calculated from the first design for the new building Abriopoint with the room features for its company-minininder garden.
In a clear picture, because most of his 90 employees (in) are in the babyboom age and the company is placed in order to return the project designers and architects as quickly as possible to their workplace.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, the children's garden is another bonus to offer the Arch.design to its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers and architects have a much easier way to bring their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The Minikinder garden is an original idea of the staff (in) of Arch.design and with the support of the management, it has made it possible for them to win the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kinder garden is financed by the operational programme for human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (CZK 2,8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be created and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the acquisition of the promotional product (2 years) the Society is obliged to continue operating the minikinder garden for 3 more years at its own costs.
The preparation of this project took place a year ago, where the Economic Rating Society provided effective assistance in the implementation of the application.
For the children, fully qualified staff - a nurse and a nurse, the children's garden can visit children without age limitations, although most of them are over three years old.
And since it's about a mini-child garden, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day is changing over several children.
The child garden operation is flexible to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights - without any reference to the company hierarchy and their special position.
Although it is a matter of individual education and care, the programme content in the mini childhood garden is still comparable to the pre-training framework programme.
The children are not only playing here, but they are offered excellent education - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, and they also learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
Parents can look at the children at any time, and so the stress comes when the children are taken away from a distant child garden.
The parents therefore use their working time more productive.
It is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal employers-employer relationships.
Arch.Design was selected among the Czech companies that provide significant benefits to new employees who are family friendly and thereby strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house is also fascinating after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof must be like the back of a prehistoric lake, the steps, such as the vibular salt of a dinosaur and the balcony are raised fish mussels.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From these inhabitants, the house, with its organic forms, came the name "Knochenhouse".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, steel plates and mosaics, which remind of shoes and all-current soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s youth style.
The fassade of the house plays with dreamy lines, short colors and textures that remind of nature and existence.
It is noted that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and thought order.
In the night, the whole phase is still more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same smooth lines and broken forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Well-formed wood copies the windows, landscapes, circuits of doors, and even gucklöchers and works.
The house Batlló in the fourth Eixample on the lively shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was built by the construction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, probably the industrialist Joseph Batlló, was originally on the abrisse of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper building.
However, the Miezhaus Casa Batllló was not alone with Antoni Gaudí.
He worked with architect Joseph Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative residence of the real estate owner and the use of museums on the fassad board were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the design of the Fassade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the park of Güell, where he also found other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Not long after his completion, the house came from the inhabitants of his organic forms because of the spitz name "Knochenhouse".
In other words, it was called the special window opening mechanism because of the "current house".
It is also said that on the top of the building was the weight of the holy Georg, the pattern of Catalans.
But further image-made elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí rented for the house a unique central heating system for the time being with escape channels and typical trucks.
It's a little strange to see her 45 degrees down.
At his creation, Gaudí ignored all the building regulations and did not allow himself to be deprived of them.
However, before the construction started, he received the relevant construction approval from the city, but the information he made on the planned reconstruction was so clear that the city’s father was so weak that two years later in the completion of the project that he asked for assistance.
The Rakhherers were also involved in the fact that the building was even involved in the public building with its pipes.
However, there was no further amendments, all the contrary - only fifteen days after the request for the city area, Joseph Batlló submitted an application for permission to rent the two highest-ranked buildings of the house - and it was promptly given to him.
The owner himself entered the lower floors.
In the gallery in the 2nd floor there is a social salon, and in the third floor there are the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The earthquake was packed into a jewellery business.
The whole six-story building runs a step up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the structure, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting rooms.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the halls, and thus a larger society could easily pulsate without having to ignore a certain privacy when talking more confidentially.
The house also received a very unusual roof and two more scorings by Gaudís Umbau in addition to a new fassad.
Also impressive is Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed helmets with which the inner courtyard is dressed and the light ceilings.
The game of these two colors provides the highest level of light for all the floors of the house.
In this he failed to use the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight in the opposite direction.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in the 2005 World Heritage List of Unesco, can be visited today by everyone.
In the first floor, the most spacious and beautiful apartment in the public is made available.
The owners of the house decide to take this step in the year and this at the time of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fair intruder business, it included the visits, as it was extended to other shared and mental spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for the construction period is no paper size, which amounts to 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist know-hows is 20 per cent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to know the true atmosphere of the house with its dragons should try to close a friendship with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right matrices and the right bedrock? Women have desires other than men
Not the best beds, but the quality of the body area - so matrices and rose make the good bed.
However, these must be harmonised in order to justify the wishes of the specific user.
When selecting, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not the gender of the hunter.
It is equally important for the interior to be subject to matrices and roses.
Typical example?
In a weekend in which it is not regularly stored, latexmatrates are not appropriate, since they need a lot longer to "heat".
In addition, they are significantly more difficult than normal polyurethane matrices.
And they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough discharge channels in the core and are still on a fixed disk, moisture is measured: it is therefore not excluded that it is formed under its shape.
Of course, when you choose, you also play a role in what you are accustomed to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high matrices are common with whiskey, will be able to adjust to a low matrice with a heart surface.
"If all Eishockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here."
"For their excavated shoulders, shoulders and hips, they simply need a bottle of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form of polymer)."
"I recommend this, among other things, to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system so that they can get "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamkýková, who specializes in dust furniture.
That's why I've been looking after a lot of Eishockey players years ago, but other customers are also worried about these matrices with Visco-scheme (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such matrices include the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous Eishockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the Visco scheme.
This "Wunder" actually works quite easily.
The shade optimises its strength and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise it usually melts into the warm body.
No matter where it's going, at night you don't like being here after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viskolastic layer also provides protection against decubitus (Wandbrand).
When selecting the matrice size, you should still calculate the length of the feet, so it is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each holder should be available at least 90 cm wide and therefore 180 cm.
In single beds, for example in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are added.
The comfort is half and also for any visitors.
On the other hand, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should still be enough space for the easily converted arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the mayor of the Polish and Romanian state, who has been involved for years in the problems of the healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also presents this subject to colleges.
In a double bed, each needs his own rose and his own matrices, but adjust to the purchase so that the matrices are equally high.
On the other hand, nothing is left but to mount the rocks at different heights and this is no longer possible at all stages.
Shoes should be at least 14 cm high, matrices with wood skeletal 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should fall on the shape sheet and the Feinpolter.
"With your hand or your nose you can't blow the feds on any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrice makes a special root type necessary.
All-polluted beds with mattocks and floorings such as combined swimming pools have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These matrices are not allowed to smell and the relationship can't be washed, which is already gone and passed today.
And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l of Switzerland, it is clear that the matrices after five to seven years will slowly become a huge (and hidden) fish.
This is also why professional advertising logos, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years at Matrates, even long-term guarantees.
She's got a wife and a baby.
And that's why a practical advice from the dealers: In matrices of 120 or 140 cm wide, it is recommended that you do not brush the hygienics of the washable, abstract objects, but it is recommended to use a matrix scanner that you can easily remove and wash.
Even if matrices are usually made with round-clock closures today, so that after opening two-halfs (even important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger matrices must be performed, especially alone, often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a rose?
Oh, my God!
Or at least for a bed for unwelcome guests and for a single night.
Also, they should view the disc with airflows (if they are no longer in it) and matrices with wood skeletal and 15 cm of mindes height with so much. Towels and Feinpolsters.
Polyurethane matrices are not included in such a description.
For non-exhaustible latent rats with 14 to 18 federations (Lamelles), latex or sandwich matrices (e.g. combinations of latex and cococos) are suitable (e.g., combinations of latex and cococs) and are always paid with a larger number of latents, including 28 and more federations, with lorodosins in the pellets and the possibility to regulate the latrine values.
There are no matrices with fibers as they do not react to ergonomic transmission.
In addition to setting the ranks of the federations, special flexible shield modules are also offered.
In this context, it is for a specific confirmation of the federal levies which enables them to press the federal levies or even move them so that they enable them to be able to make the exact impressions of the debtor's debt.
Of course, for men with broad shoulders is an important thing.
There are even matrix manufacturers who have started using "herrenmatrate" weichzones for the shoulder area.
The women are also thought to be able to afford these white zones in the area.
For the most demanding customers, punctuated flying systems (lattoflex) or roses with punctuated contact paths are determined by multiple feeding.
The pressure is divided into several points, which reduces tension.
But - if you use a bad (great and full) head pockets for the right matrices and the right root, most benefits will be lost again.
Here is also a line: the head pockets should support the head, its tops should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore looks like a 50 x 60 cm big kisses, as the Scandinavians like for example.
In the page box, the head pockets (with the shoulder load zone in the chest or the soft zone in the matrix) should match the shoulder height.
Some of our modern matrices have mixed up with the single (filled with today) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more often natural materials or at least their fittings.
The new word "Bio" is also used in matrates.
Instead of raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane foams more often than natural oils, such as rice and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"It is called by Matrates, whose core consists of material pure natural origin," explains Petr Vaschiček from Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of matrices - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also make micropsel that spread fresh wood or lavender duft when sleeping.
There's also a difference between men and women.
While men are used as a "swift" plant extract from Birken leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the properties for women have a "heating" effect.
Extracts from red paprikaschots flow into the blood circulation, and the weakest sex becomes so quiet when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Caltschaum matrates (he has larger pores with lower cell structure and is therefore more active than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
Through the combination of the different stages (herte) of cold forests and visco forests, multi-zone matrices, which know exactly where the head, hips and shoulders are located.
However, for a high-quality matrices, 7000 crowns and more are needed.
However, health matrices are usually taxed with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You see, saving on matrices and rock is not that easy.
Here and again there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers, the two matrices at the price of a offer.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the matrix duofreeze with a Visco-shaum memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur, which led the era of viskolastic foams with open cell structure and high density in close space.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA because the astronomers are subjected to enormous burdens at the start.
Tempur will cool at heat, it will cool again in warm millieu.
So the human body fits perfectly and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent printing from burning, but it generally increases sleep comfort.
Viskolastic foams are used not only for matrices, but also for other health products, such as for special footposts, which are to be used to make the bones and fats easier.
For example, domestic manufacturers use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of raising their own children and thus consider more and more parents to monitor them through GPS.
The system that was originally found for driving can be as good people as it would be helpful in such cases, just as it would have been in the absence of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is now about as large as a cigarette box, but it should not be more than a strap.
Many people have put the case of missing Anička in fear and fear and thus keep them on the way to better protect their children.
Also for the price of a violation of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not going to spy on him, but that it is an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS equipment on the Czech market.
"I suggest that, in a single case, it may be possible to use such devices, for example, if you put someone in a bag without he knows about it, but we had no such case to mention before."
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "chattel" serves and how to use it when necessary.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like such a thing, it simply deletes himself.
"And very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"The phones were initially highly expected by parents, but they can easily turn off as these new surveillance devices," said Mrs. Bočková.
Your opinion is also disputed whether such an arrangement actually helps in the event of an attack.
"For planned removals, the kidnapper is always checking the child's ability to have any electronics that could be transmitted to him."
"Today's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also search for them, as their sales would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step forward," the psychologists say.
However, it suggests that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
Roberta Čech from the RC monitoring company, which provides location services for both car and person, can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set up in such a way as to indicate the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it is destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of toxic devices, even a respirator is integrated, which means that if you like and stay free of movement, the device immediately sends a warning under the heading," said Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services may also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but only a special software is needed.
The problem of the current operating devices is that either of the devices in the power supply chain sizes, the trailers, or smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing them.
As a result, Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil is testing the devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that any attacker must not recognize that it is a monitoring or control device.
"Or he notes it only after a certain time, which the police have a time advance," he adds.
Whatever the direction in which the development is going - towards amendments or accessions, the same technology will always be used, as in the vehicle structure.
So about the combination of generating function using the GPS system (as well as on navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many censorships that you could turn all over Czechs, but you could keep only two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of sundry, which has been frozen with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres to the army camp.
It is already disturbing to know that the fighting forces have been in control for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the sunglasses - two, but not more than four years.
The army purchased the sinister from the company STV Group, a.k.a. for lipid 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this violent amount of Zendschnur, the General Staff MF DNES responded, which would be spent every year on the 60 kilometres of Zendsknur.
The research of army pyrotechnics, the MF DNES responsible for this, suggests that the entire army must complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and officers.
Minister of Defence Alexander Vondra and General Vlastimil Picek were not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the significant annual consumption of six-kilometres of sugarcane.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts applies to training each new professional team of two metres in a row, then the army has created itself by these new purchases - even in the light of the growing needs of the pioneer and special units - a refreshing advantage for the already mentioned 225 years.
In this regard, the soldiers of the speedy Brigade have complained recently of Minister Vondra's defense, they had almost no patterns for weapons, so the shootings of the missing funds have been severely limited.
Get away from underhospitality.
"I don't even know why they're buying so many things from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer who wants us to fight as dealers," says STV Group Jan Décky.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence, is based on the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur, so that the army would have covered themselves with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the Zündschnürer and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"It is also possible for the four years mentioned to be in perfect storage," said one of them, who wants to remain unhindered, not to be seen as a soldier in the army as a soldier.
At the end of the period of use, each ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the life of the soldiers.
But these tests are not unusual, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the Mengenrebatt for the 445 kilometers south of Zündschnur.
"They cost us six percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," said the speaker Pejšek, sharing the position of the purchaser of the Ministry of Defence.
The annual consumption of pyrotechnics by police, liquidating the ammunition from the second world war or the Soviet brothers' army has been increasing for some years almost 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition that they can still use before the end of the period of use.
The safety of the pyrotechnics has already been ensured, and thus the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus more reliable sciences is open.
The Ministry of Defence has, despite serious problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-pound Czech Slovak People's Army was preparing for its accession to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnics, the MF DNES, in a few years, the Czech battle forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old Züdschührer that they have purchased today so "best".
To this day, I have the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition.
Lukáš Pytloun has helped to sell his hotel in France.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec won the last year of the competition for the Year.
The history of his success must be seen as a film scenario.
You're going to like the trip to Python.
First, he was aware that in Liberec, there are no good evenings available at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation abroad and with the help of a bank credit, he built a temporary house with five apartments.
It is thought that he was a high school student at the sixth semester, that was certainly a courageous subject.
"The price quality ratio at the time was a concern to me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rebuilt apartment he rents to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested the entire gain, which he then made a step towards retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has been able to open two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
In this year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have already signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé that we have sold our French concept and other stakeholders in the French of the Pytloun hotels have already reported themselves," says the entrepreneur Number One of the last year.
"A large share of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just been the victory in the competition "the entrepreneur of the year", adds Mr. Pytloun.
The victory has brought him greater fame, popularity in Liberec and the environment.
"People recognized me on the street, they often congratulated me even at night, and I have to say it was right," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't need to win the same, every visualization is good.
He says that he has benefited from contacts and knowledge that have not yet been reached.
"With some people I've met with thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relations."
The peace associated with success is still a little lower than any of its employees.
And then there's seven.
"I note with them greater loyalty and confidence that they are part of something that will be shared by general recognition."
I see this too not only as personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something in the background," said Lukáš Pytloun.
My followers wanted a peaceful year when we had it in farm
The victory itself was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The price for the first stage of Vodafone’s competition company in the past year was rejected by Karel Žðárský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury then praised the efforts he made in Česká Skalice from the small factory, which resulted in hundreds of millions of sales from the ground.
"I can say that this award not only encourages me, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort was made to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žðárský as compensation for the property claimed by the Communists, he did not delay, left his career in the company where he had worked until then, and set up with a few of his father's cameras a own company for the production of plastic containers.
A short time later they started focusing on plant oil presses.
In 18 years, they have increased to the largest manufacturer of automatic press across Central Europe.
But only through the success of the said competition and its mediation, they have also become aware of non-publicity.
"Not only is our customers making the brand farm more intense now, but our foreign partners are also beginning to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žðárský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of victory.
The valuation was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of industrial products.
The crisis, which was still less the citizens, but mainly the company, reached its peak – many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't get out of this situation."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even get discounts," says Karel Žžárský
In the meantime, a viable company must take such extraordinary measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation into the grip and keep the company in the black numbers, even though with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company did not want to make cuts - in investment in research and development.
"From the committee we build a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired key prices in domestic exhibitions," says Ząárský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnover is growing again and the number of new workers with them is increasing.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy on the win - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Žžárský.
A question of opinion which conflicts with unreasonable rules
The question of "insurance of the year" is for the fourth time part of the company's competition.
Some unreasonable rules have already been created from the world.
For the two-thirds of the next year's opinion, "Averority of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents to authorities that are available online.
More than one third of non-four thousand voting firms were selected.
The social security administration thus requested a paper withdrawal from the trade register, even if it could have been obtained by the staff by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require any exemptions from the trade register in the future in the control of social insurance fees," the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Buranjová said.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion "insurance of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the Lupe, to meet the entrepreneurs in Chechnya and to raise the insensibility.
This year is already the fourth part of a business competition organised by the Czech Economics (HN) and is in favour of increasing popularity in the public.
In the past year, if the three thousand people were involved in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations to serve alone and to stop business.
"As for, for example, the number of income tax formalities, we are taking a forward course in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship is the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in Chechnya has not improved.
According to the World Bank, Chechnya takes into account the business conditions of 74. Rank, compared to the previous year, an 8-place worse location.
The competition of the year was first launched in the year and played every year after the same scenario.
From April to the end of the competition, each man can report administrative and bureaucratic differences.
The Web address is available at www.ffaroku.cz. Then the competition organizers are looking for seven candidates for the "antipreis" and the public can vote on the website www.ffaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
This is the absurdity that comes with most votes.
In this year's opinion, more than a hundred, 105 non-significant regulations and arrangements have been reported.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professionals and journalists.
Among the so-called "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are also provisions for the payment of maintenance vehicles for road and fast roads or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must be prepared every two years.
The list of this year's "Sieben" is published on the pages of the competition.
The launch of the competition in the beginning of November on the Prague Wessels Square is part of a campaign, which includes regular participation in the personality of political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association, small or medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, was at the height of the competition with the party.
"What the state is putting the business link between its legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to raise at least thirty paragraphs every year, which are still unnecessary for entrepreneurs," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create indiscriminate arrangements from the world show the effect.
In 2007, the majority of businesses broke the obligation to inform the company at its permanent office three days in advance of their intention to carry out an exhibition or a exhibition.
This obligation has been raised by a novelty of the law of the company.
The obligation that 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the obligation to report to the Working Party services of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them.
And all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation, which set aside physiotherapists, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger cars in the living room.
This Regulation was amended in some ways by the Ministry of Health this year - the carbon obligation was abolished.
A new category deserves socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition for the economic year (HN) is the category "Responsibility Company 2010".
The main reason for this competition is to promote meaningful and fair businesses.
"We would like to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your business activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, the speaker and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For the first year of this special sub-category of Vodafon’s main competition company for the year, companies, which are not the only long-term objective, were notified.
The history of each of them is extremely inspiring and gives enough substance for a self-sustaining article.
Although they differ in the subject matter of their activity, their efforts have still a common rapporteur - support and feedback.
Here, for example, it is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a well-known company in the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a Foundation for Disabled Children for Seventeen years.
A paper factory from Podébrady is also looking forward to its health-care workers, 70 per cent of whom were awarded the title "Responsibilized Company of the Region" and in the competition of Vodafone Company of the Year, she highlighted the third level in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the bookkeeping company MiRyz Soft, which introduced a flying and also an average of 35 hours per week, introduced work time without a relatively low wage.
The jury also respected the fact that the company was mainly purchased by Czech producers, supported by citizen initiatives in its environment and worked on environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as we can to keep the consequences of our business activity and administration to the environment as little as possible," said her business manager Milushé Ryznarová.
The responsible IT companies Sign up from the Ústí nad Labem Region is again in the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired them to all the notebooks ergonomic sexes and keyboards, and it also encourages them in their work at home and in business activities, using mapping services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Not", which will provide specific assistance to this Roma community," says Ondréj Suchý, the company's representative.
In addition, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištíní" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to the interest insurance of its employees in the form of Extra Bonuses.
"We provide our employees' contributions to the work path, to increase their qualification and holiday," said Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntal, the winner in the Märish-Schlesische region.
The category of responsible company of the year was automatically registered by all the regional finalists of Vodafon’s competition company of the year who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the notification and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
Wrong or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the contracting companies failed to respond to the questions, they were excluded from the competition "Responsibility-conscious company of the year", and in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, they were not disqualified for this reason."
"A separate admission to this competition is not possible only because it is only a sub-categories of the main competition company of the year," says Karel Goldman of the agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - Police arrests at a public hearing
In the construction of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took note in the last few days.
This was done by the media entrepreneurs and real estate dealer Luboš G. by the detectives in hand-helds.
It was alleged that it had tried to manipulate an existing public competition for the granting of refunds in such a way that the basics offered in the competition would be of particular interest.
This is supposed to have paid half a million for Luboš G.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are following a person because of the delicacy of corrupt companies in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pilsner State Administration of the newspaper "Právo" could not provide further details in the context of ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, 46-year-old entrepreneurs were released from the police.
How he managed to manipulate the public competition can only be speculated in the light of professional official information.
The talk of the Land Fund of Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, which the police had actually taken in the Pilsner area of the Land Fund, and this during a public competition.
"It went to a client and talked to one of our employees," she specified.
The public competition followed the correct title "Requirement to issue claims for the transfer of basic goods under the law" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the proposed piece.
"These persons offer a higher value in the context of the claim to be accompanied by the transfer of their claims for refund than the excavated basic value."
"In accordance with the tenders offered, the number of potential buyers will be determined, and the bottom fund will then transfer the basic item to the person with the highest offer," the fund's speaker explains.
Luboš G. was apparently available with information on who had notified himself of the request and since he himself was a right person, since he had purchased a number of refund claims, he pointed out that he had a legitimate interest in withdrawing himself from the competition.
Obviously against a fat recovery.
This would also be an adequate explanation for why he had a large amount of money in his statement.
Luboš G. had in the past very good contacts with the Pilsner Ground Fund.
He also played a role in the cause of the former Chief of the Land Fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he was released in replacement refunds on basic parts of which local decisions were already made on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, acquired basics that were intended to build public roads, said more precisely at the site where the construction of the road masterry was planned for Borské Poland.
Later, he met with the Master of a house directly at the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the basics.
At that time, the Council had to have a hard heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the basics.
The cost of housing increases by a few hundred a month
Since January, households must not only account for higher costs for all kinds of energy, but also for higher water and water costs and also increase the rent.
Families will have to draw hundreds of crowns a month more from the Portemonau than before.
The electricity will be up to 4.6 percent expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities it will be necessary to pay up to a dozen more for water supplies and also to reduce the VAT.
Only the electricity supply costs the housing costs a few hundred more crowns per year.
The strong power prices were taken up by all main suppliers, so the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic installations, is to be seen.
However, gas is only slightly more expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat most of the heat and have the highest consumption.
So here is also to calculate with a few hundred crowns per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for city-to-city electricity are different.
Above all, larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay monthly to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns per year are paid to families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague once again earn 9% higher water and water costs and this is the case that the city increases infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, is the lowest compared to all Czechs.
In the northern regions where the prices are now at the highest, water and water charges are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
Large price increases, for example, are expected in 14,000 apartments, with the same amount from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, has the rent from January to rise by 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with this increase in rent want to take a legitimate interest in the company.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 dwellings today, should rise by more than 10 per cent next year.
Chechnya children chat with Fernet and Rum Beer is out - it's easy to slow
Remote, Rum and Wodka, except for a good whisky, which you stole from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks that must be treated for the most common treatment of Czech teenagers after their benefits.
No exceptions are children who have to leave their father in the hospital repeatedly.
This is illustrated by the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children in clinics.
"Bir or wine are completely out of fashion, because it's just too long until you're drunk."
"The trend today is clearly a heart of alcohol," said Právo Ludék Pelikán, the head of the child care department in the medium-sized clinic Horíovice.
"Wishky, if it fails to use the father a bottle from the housebar, and if not, then at least a remote or wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová is right for him.
"Most often it's about the phone or the room."
"This is today's alcohol trade, namely basic schools."
"It also went on to Slibowitz, which was taken from home," Mrs. Jurinová said.
Chafarzt Pelikán has been the victim of a three- or four-year-old drunk in the hospital.
Before the clinic in Horóvice, where he has been working this year, he has been working for ten years in the Paediatric division of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars delivered to students who were forced from the back and forth.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"They started their career with 12 years when they were first introduced with 3.5 Promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
"She was in the exhibition area in Holeschovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't even notice that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief said.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in dealing with their own infants is considered one of the main causes of growing children's alcoholism.
In order to be truly dependent on the true meaning of the word, experts do not then go to children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case in these children."
In those who continue to enjoy alcohol, it is mostly a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital’s Motol, Mrs. Jurinová, was introduced to this department for the treatment of children and adolescents by mid-November.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol consumption that made a hospital stay necessary can be included in the statistics.
Deprived children who are brought to home after an ambulance treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only once had a bottle of shnaps in the school bank, there are three annual amplitudes in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán, on which there are hundreds of percentages: Walpurgis night, Silver and the end of the school year.
"This last one for two reasons - either from room to room because of bad witness or from joy on holidays."
"In the night of Walpurgis, I have also experienced seven drunk children on once in the record," said Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is far better off than a child who has to fight only with an innocent cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be transmitted in the hospital with a fluid-sustaining infusion with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're clearly better off, because after the "miracle" experience at night, they wake up with good wages, without doing anything wrong."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán says, "where he at least earns the patients through at least the good wages by telling them about the costs they will have to deal with.
Because transport with the rescue car and the night comes in an acute bed and is pleased with a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"He and again I have used it as a means of relaxation when I have told the children directly about what their drinking cost and that it can happen through them that they may have to work through all the holidays to earn money for a single party," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, he did not consider the cases of the disease to be regressive in order to require the necessary costs to be borne by the parents.
Two Training Tools L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light combat vehicles L-159 of all five, which were exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain on Tuesday, where the Spanish Air Force manufacturer Casa - EADS is staying.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
In the country, they were only seen by mannovers or flight shows.
This is about the flightable two-side version L-159T1 operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are unique L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the manager of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When she sends the planes physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The L-159 single combat aircraft was again excluded from long-term entrants, without further inputs and investments from the Ministry's resource.
"The two sides of the L-159T1 were replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without 2nd combat vehicles, since the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the construction of four L-159 overflows to the second version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second of which wants to take over until the end of this year.
Pejšek has subsequently committed EADS to implement the fighter aircraft in the equipment of one NATO country.
"In the contract it is clear and clear that the company EADS is the receiver of the L-159 aircraft and that they should serve as pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the matter of the recipient, in which way he realizes the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The sales of five L-159 against a transport vehicle Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were still authorized by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tendering procedure, but EADS spoke directly.
The then defence group argued that this table would support the future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she uses only 24, and wanted to consume the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may also have a court record.
The European Commission called on the Czech Ministry of Defence to appeal to the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken three casa aircraft, which is to land within fourteen days at Kbely Airport.
A longer display finger as ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose display finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This should be associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is especially true in men up to six," said the mitator of the study, Ross Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostatic cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health injuries, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, while also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the right-hand indicator was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the same probability of prostate cancer was the same as 19 percent of those men whose ring and significer were the same length.
However, in men whose display finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk was 33 per cent, in men up to 6 per cent, even 87 per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers already formed in the prenatal age clearly reflects the different mirror of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer display finger.
Previous studies revealed that the testosterone only accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, head of the Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, he was well aware of this study, but he did not maintain the relationship between the finger long and the cancer risk until now.
Chechnya in snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just as the majority of Europe's Czechs are in the early morning, they are under a snowy roof.
On the streets and slopes are mostly fixed snow, the winter ministers were mostly all night on the Axse.
The road D5 between the km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozwadov is closed because of some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the central Auto-Moto Club (UAMK).
At the square mile 91, a LKK failed, two Lkws stood together at 93 km, and in this case, there were injuries.
A few pkws are also in the streets.
There are also problems at a kilometer 185 of the D1 road in the direction of Prague.
There are also two lakes together.
The drivers should either drive back to Brno by 190 km or over Brno and drive 182 kilometers to the village of Kývalka.
There they form a mile long stop.
Also on the D11 is an accident, and the same is true when traveling to Prague.
In Prague, there is a few inches thick snowy and the thermometer shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons, for example in the town of Prosek, also the Štěrboholská street is completely closed.
The safest means of transport is the Metro anyway.
The roads run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and peaceplace.
About eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Kristentab joins.
There are also problems on the train and on the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast-track connections due to snow movements.
There are problems, for example, on the track Prague - Kralupy or even Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should inform themselves about the current situation.
The Ruzyní Airport has been closed from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Most roads in South Seas are only available with increased caution.
For Vyškov, three sideways are completely unfavourable, in the area of Brno, the shape of snowflakes and in the area of Blansko is forced to use snowflakes on some of the above roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three streets are still closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Miljesovice.
You will also have to use snowflakes here.
If they are re-enacted, they can't be underestimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is given in the area of the white carpaths.
On the roads that can only be driven from natural protection bases with inner means, a length of up to five inches thick, led by ČTK.
In Chechnya, it falls from two to ten centimetres of Neuschnee, most of which are in the north - it is up to 18 centimetres.
In the Mediterranean region, up to 15 centimetres of Neuschnee falls.
But in Chechnya it sounds too slow to cut.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which has been known only under their code name XM-25.
The general hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the existing conflict with the Taliban and shift the power ratio to its benefits.
The new weapon is something like a supergender cannon.
Your projects will be reached by laser with a few meters of contact with the target.
The special shocks of caliber 25 mm, developed for this threat and containing highexplosive explosives, work practically as small granates.
The shells can be programmed so that they can explode not only at the top of the target but at a convenient point of their ballistic flight.
That is, you can use them against a enemy who hides behind a barrier - a wall or in a shelter grave.
From above, he is not usually protected, so the killer steel striper can easily put him out of the fight.
Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, is the first child-fighting weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier goes on the basis of this: he sees the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise point of view, after which he corrects the increase angle, then he just needs to print it out again.
"Let's say once, you measured 543 m."
"When you press down, the weapon starts running and shoots the gun at the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are lost
The Fujitsu Group loses its lease in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the next year 400 employees will be placed in the Astro Park from the previous office building at the Marienbader Place in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese company Fujitsu loses its download in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will be assigned their jobs from the former Marienbader Place in Bad Homburg in Astro Park, a large office complex on the Lyon Street in the Frankfurt City of Niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that, in the meantime, more than 100 other jobs of the company should be distributed to the region.
The offer has been extremely attractive, and the large rooms in Astro Park are better suited to the working methods of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a guest.
The competent business leader Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a central location with excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt Niederrerad."
The excellent connection to the airport is just for a global company like Fujitsu of great importance.
The new approach of an important company within the region was an expression of the joy of winning and disappointment in losing.
The Frankfurter Economicserent Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was once again a "global player" won.
This is a "great local knowledge".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for the underground.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city has been informed of the purpose of the business management.
"We have naturally offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts had nothing to do with the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the seller of the real estate at Marienbader Square.
Finally, economic reasons had given rise to the challenge.
Now it is going to prevent a long learning at such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and renter of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the Rathausplatz and the nearby "Little Vertical" was part of the other buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago on the most controversial construction projects in the city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new urban area was created between the railway station and the Rathaus, which was responsible for the massive construction of the areas previously used as a parking lot as well as the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the plant consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel systems, start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu who was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Cancen group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and was sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu conurcer in Tokyo is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The Netherlands in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, however, more workers are counted as Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, which is expected to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, Astro Park 7000 square meters were rented in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its starlike foundations - has its seat, including the central chain of electronic technology and electronics industry.
Amazon closed server - Dried against Assange
Wikileaks is becoming more and more depressed.
The Amazon Internet service provider has connected the fill-in platform from its servers.
It is possible that there will be hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats in the post-publication of political pressure.
Wikileaks-gener Assange is apparently in England.
The Wikileaks heating platform is increasingly stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lose access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies on the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's prison list, is to be held in Britain after a newspaper report.
"Wickleaks from the Amazon server are destroyed."
"Free talk in the country of freedom," the enthusiasts shared with the enthusiasts on Wednesday (Orderday).
Before long, the Internet company Amazon linked Wikileaks documents to its servers.
Internet activists have been back on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic missions to manage the high access rates on the documents.
Wikileaks explained on Twitter: "Prima - our dollars will now be spent to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using his server by Wikileaks, after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman conducted research, the CNN television transmitter reported on the Liebermans office.
The president of the Senate Committee for Homeland Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to deny the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unrecognizable and unannounced actions put our national security at stake and threatened the globe's lives," said a message from the semi-trailer.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks-founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden for rape, is on Interpol's prison list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Britain, who is well known for Scotland Yard, is on the ground.
The Internet activist has always referred to the findings in Sweden as the intruder of his opponent.
Wikileak's speecher Kristin Hraffsson said in London, there were drawings.
"It even called after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was right about his safety, said Hraffson.
The Wikileaks Founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hraffsson was obviously responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks funerals be prosecuted and prosecuted.
In Canada, a consultant from government chief Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a dragon.
The white house and Assange, therefore, produced a slag exchange.
American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, said that Assange had called for the return of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for spying claims to diplomats that were recently known.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US Government is now covering the protection of its databases.
As a Special Representative, the vice director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, shared the White House with him.
Travers would be responsible for developing "needed structural reforms" which was necessary after Wikileaks revealed the message.
The White House also wants to examine the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US Government also announced that they should be put at risk by the Wikileaks publication in order to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists.
"We have taken everything to contact them," said foreign-speaking Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice-collars are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From the gelatium and the gelatium.
The gelatier, in German, at the age of the ice-cream, sets the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-mapping art.
The gelaio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a spaghetti, throws it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to travel to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who else would like to know more about Eis who does not come to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Eis University has established the manufacturer of Eismachines in 2003 so that the Eiscreme from its machines will be justified throughout the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
However, there is also a daily special course around chocolate and practice in the household ice.
Some sleep in the middle of the crisis from a new career, others just drive on the smooth ice of their empty sights.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an artist from California, loves the Slow Food Movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to apply for years in a nerve-free job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not only good taste, but also good taste and consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the dream of the national, and at the same time of the Southern Hemisphere: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then every amount of Romantics is there."
The first step in production seems quite simple.
Luciano taps into a large mixture of milk, salt, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers, which builds up everything with an electronic program at 85 degrees and then quickly cools up to four degrees.
Then he lifts up a leg on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white bass screen, the basis for all milk varieties.
The doctor will immediately ask questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you run your own experiment loss?
Luciano warns to let himself be led by the newspaperist into the Irish.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" has, however, been able to use stabilisers - most of them a natural product, about sugarmeal from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabiliser, only then you have to sell it within a day, otherwise it falls together, and the customer benefits from light ice cream.
Certain variations to the basic mass are allowed.
It's more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the advantages of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pasten.
"The suppliers will all try to give you thousands of aromatized additions."
"But you should just experiment."
Both with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or at the ice cream from the white ground mass that becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder based on all possible chocolate performances.
Now the trainers can take on the sailboats.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and Haselnus ice - with or without eggs in the ground mass, with more or less Vanille aroma or other natural additions.
The same experiment will also be followed by fruit varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit-purie - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnus ice does not taste even more fresh if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabiliser.
Just a balanced mix has made the taste of a gelato right, says Luciano.
Exhibition is a calculation task: if Pfrysich purie is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar component must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A extraction sugar is needed for lemonesis.
Luciano has a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (Winzer measures the oechsle in the grape must).
Unfortunately, the computers are easy to use.
Eating does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device to automatically produce the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mix is made creamy at the same time and cooled at minimum temperatures.
Not all automating on the roof remain small pants.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his college colleagues are cut down from above to below with fruit purée, as he is equipped with over-dimensional steel mixers other than control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something happens."
Drivers in charge
The European Food Authority, Efsa, has been underprivileged by the plant experimenting industry.
This draft is now formulated by the Expert Group of Test Biotech, which is understood as an independent institution for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Test biotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert has been also at the lobbyist association with Ilsi for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Cooper has been working with the Efsa testing regulations for plant species and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The Efsa regulations are essentially identical with Ilsi's position papers and thus render the industry's manual, which is actually to be controlled by the Italian parliament.
It has already been the second time that test biotech is a society of interest.
So whether a high-level efsa manager is young without crews or a passing time to Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - it has changed the pages.
The Central German Roundfunk (MDR) has also recently included personal links between the control authority of the EU and industry, which has made the Environment Agency as well as the EU Parliamentarians.
However, the Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
It is important to return to all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, that is an opinion.
Experts working for Efsa did not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But they had to reveal it.
Kuiper is working for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then are critical that genetically modified plants are now permitted without any animal feeding test and that the response of plants to environmental impacts will not be tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize makes on the acker," says Then.
At present practice is simply isolated proteins, but not to test the whole plant, which does not prefer any reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how should you find them then?" then he asks.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck looks like.
The scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently active at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the United States, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or educate critical scientists in Europe.
That's why there's hardly any researchers that haven't been in contact with companies.
For companies, critical studies would normally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell is also concerned, totaling about 400 kilos.
On the Montagabend, he was standing at Stuttgarter Train Station, the tuba on the back.
It's Demo.
It's fast.
The story is known: in September the rear was turned off and had started to break a large piece of the northern plane.
The Stuttgarter World was no longer the same: thousands of demonstrators demonstrated against S21, the thousands of thousands of heavy charges of the train station.
When it came to the top, a large part of the flight was in drummers.
Break in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft grave stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a housekeeper in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
He's got a couple of brakes.
"These stones are relicions."
"They can't disappear."
He says, "A cheap and poor stone, easy and boring."
When he woke up, the guy came up to cigarettes.
What he's gonna do with the brakes, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Stone leads to a forest in Tübingen on a former munitions dump of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all the people who came to Stuttgart at the time of April.
"It would be a shame if they were thrown to the trash or disappeared in the warehouse," he said in his office, a wooden hole that was once a toilet.
He was arrested and threatened, told him that in September he had bought the rest of the North Fleet from the operator.
But he's been talking to the S-21 fighters for a long time.
And he told them that he couldn't even do anything for the Abrissian.
And if it happened once now, then it would be the most profitable if the stones continued to be used.
About 200 S-21 winners took part in one of the 80 kilos heavy square with a price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reflection, some also hope to return to him in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large truckloads.
About half still stored in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landlords, housekeepers.
From everywhere they had come and had removed what coffeeroom and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgarter stones of the anstox have long been transformed into "Mauerle" or limited to grasslands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"We won't be the political components."
He rises in his car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great wealth.
Jura studied and broke down, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And Stein's lover.
40000 tons of stone stored.
From all over Germany, he draws his treasures together.
He said he was the biggest old man in the Republic.
It's hotter.
There are artificial sandstones in the snow.
"They were once part of Dresdner Marien bridge," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he's hot.
"My Lovelingsstein."
It's going up the road through the forest.
It appears on a stone: red sandstone, the former part of Karlsruer Trainhofs.
And so on.
"Dear Travertin."
First, the squares belonged to the tribune of the Stutgart Neckarstadion.
About the snowy stones and stories, cannstatter Travertin from the Stutgart police station, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasia, Tuff from the Heilbroner Hospital.
What work, what power, what glory.
If Rongen thinks of how the stones were taken by hand before and moved with simple bottled rings and eyeglasses, he will be very respectful.
"But it would be a scandal if you hurt something like that."
He hasn't become rich, he's not strong yet.
But 14 people are working today with stone dealers, and they have also left themselves in the woods of stone, an imagehouse, a smile, a glass of glass and a garden building.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the rest of us.
That's the first time he has to go to Cologne.
There's a stone to save, too.
High-potential Talent
It's King Andrang at Buffet.
16 Students struggle with breast-feeding, tomato soup and sugar.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Auto-Builder Volkswagen have invited machine and design students to a workshop.
In an idea-making competition, they should learn with VW developers about the car of the future - and in addition to popular cars.
In the fight against the worst leaders, many companies are fighting and putting, like VW, on cooperation with universities.
Your mission: The most dedicated graduates can be recruited in the hearing cells as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are requisitioned by others.
And because the universities do not issue an opinion on the services of their students, they try to slow down the exceptional metals in practical projects and join themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car companies turn around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes rubber pens, rubber bars and folders with VW-Logo.
It tells about the promising young people of practice programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Sele from the TU Braunschweig is the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students are in contact with industry and collect experience."
"VW can get students to know at the same time, get interested candidates closer together and think about who comes into question as employees."
Such cooperation, such sales, is not unusual.
Newly, it'll be so offensive to the students.
"The focus was on the professional project," says Sele.
The struggle for the fresh gradients is likely to get worse.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to search their employees out of a large range of competitors.
They need to pray and pay particular attention to highly qualified labour forces.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineer VDI, over 40,000 engineers remained unattended in October.
And the so-called engineering success is becoming even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic inspection and advisory company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the Talentjagd.
It organises exciting recreation events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting-edge, where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company to the United States in the next year.
In addition, the participants can view KPMG files and get to know the company.
Anyone who can decide in two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the crème de la Créme of many lovers fly to the United States.
The protection of the high potentials at universities is increasingly known as Dykta.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Just a simple sailor was too small for us."
For Talentjäger Dykta, the account seems to go up.
"To date, we have contact with all participants with similar action in the last year."
"Some will stand shortly before their conclusion and will soon compete with us," he says.
In addition to the direct budgets at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classic when they go to the market.
"We're trying to reach graduates on skills."
"Ever on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, a personal leader at Solar Technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Steps to the problem of growth.
At present, 35 posts have been posted on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to have casual positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the Uni-Professors.
Solarworld is co-operated with various schools, about the University of Freiberg.
"The professors show that you can practice with us or write your diplomas."
Your advertising activities are not reported to solar specialists.
The company is trying to acquire other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flake hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can't often be offered by a large company," says the staff leader.
Money will no longer play the main role in the search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good growth opportunities are also crucial factors.
At a study of the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld held 55th place among the 100 best workers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual list of German employers.
It asks employees how they are satisfied with their work and their jobs and look at the conditions for employees.
Staff leader step also expects additional points from the location of the job seekers.
"I think that tenderer will look especially after external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Wareler from the German Employer Branding Academy tells companies who want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He's saving his customers for more authenticity.
And this means, according to war, particularly internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is to get your own employees," he says.
In the sector, the internal employer branding is the job market training within its own company.
"Happy employees are the best messengers."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would be hired by friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It's like a game with bands," says the warrior.
Obama stops new oil spills
Before the U.S. Federal Republic of Florida's Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil spills in the coming years.
An appropriate ban has been lifted by the government in Washington - and therefore their former plans have been finally rejected.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drills are underway.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Exemptor for the strict ban, which should apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the Bohrplatform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his presence on the pressure of the opposition and industry to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The sponsors want to reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil imports.
Anyone who carries the responsibility for the dominant olive oil in the Gulf has not been finally cleared up until today.
In the centre of the crisis, the British energy group BP is faced with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry in the order of Obama will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop after the explosion.
As a result, various oil companies also applied for new drill projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been in charge of many corruption, will be substantially reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced that it would close the lucrative tax surpluses for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warned that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by a stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - even before the midweek drill ban.
The American Energy Alliance also regrets the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new promotion projects will continue to grow - allow for growth.
Ogoniland is burnt
The water in the rivers is al-alibran, which is as abundant as at the tank station: billions of litres of raw oil have destroyed the nature of the Nigerian ogoniland.
People live by fate, corruption and illegal alcohol.
Celestine Akpobari says it's good.
"You don't pay," the eco-activist laments the journalists: "You're still getting enough oil in front of the line."
The 37-year-old Nigerians have been trying to light up a young man waiting in the water with the surrounding sludges: In the rain-coloured waterline, the scene is almost beautiful.
It's not to be seen that moving brown redwood under the surface is not to be seen.
Previously, she had gathered garnels here, told Esther Badum at the bottom of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the river flows will be complete.
Five years ago, some raw oil was grown in the vast area of the forest.
Fishingmen from the nearby town of Bodo now need to run six hours to reach fishing water: The Ogonilland, located in the heart of Nigerdeltas, is one of the worst regions in the world.
On the road through the mangrove clouds that are carried by river flows, the whole size of the movement is immediately suspended.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat wants to brows, whoever washs his hands in water, the bright fingers out.
The roots of mangrove trees fall like black lacrisis from the ground, leaving the leaves of their roots undiminished.
Bird warms, as they are otherwise common in fatty areas, seek forgiveness: As soon as the outer surface moves, it spreads into the old paradise of splendourlike paradise.
"What's going on here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war has been made.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe came here, organized here in the 1980s with the later executive writer Ken Saro-Wwa of the first resistance, where the Shell Group had to set up its production in 1993 because it was dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still threatening to return to Ogoniland: During the entire Delta region of Switzerland's three-fold size with more than 5,000 drills and 7000 kilometers of drilling, more than two million pieces of black gold are pumped daily, while the oil fields in Ogoniland are able to establish the position of the group.
All a few hundred meters of stilts, such as strange sculptures from the water, are called "Christian trees" by the heads of the bohrlöchers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded up to the mark.
This is always the case, I mean Akpobari, and then a constant stream of red oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have been flown into the Delta's ecosystem for 50 years: the amount of oil per year, as it was during the summer of the supertanker's "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska Drang - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are responsible for the remaining eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group Sabotage and the organised oil stand are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmental protection is seen as the main cause of burns and mild pepperines.
Shell lay significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than in the rest of the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner spoke to the 2008 Group: Only the rate of failures on the leadership would be "in a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a abandoned, oily workshop under the free sky, they descend from the mangroves designed on: they are splintered and up to the neck.
Under one of the many fascists that are partly linked to noises, partly deliberately spread on the ground, a fire is flicker: an illegal small refinery.
In the fascist the roh oil will be heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First, Benzin pushes through the rose into the top, then melts at the end of the direction of kerosin and finally gets out of Diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four feet a day Diesel à 300 liters: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic fatigue button in the largest state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with almost 40 Euro cent per liter can still be subsidized by illegal cooks: because their raw material is also available.
It comes from "bunkern", which the Pipelinenettz called by Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts in all Nigerdelta, at least 16 million litres of roh oil are lost every day.
However, only a small fraction of the provisionally interconnected raw material is unlawfully distributed: the Löunen part is filled with organised criminal networks, which should also include politicians and high-ranked soldiers, in tank ships, and throw them into the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is responsible for the conversion of the population or the low production method, holds Akpobari as a clean academic activity.
"If the oil companies were not to be taken as finals and had not destroyed the life base of the fishermen, neither Saturday nor Diebstal and illegal refineries would have been destroyed."
In the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is particularly destructive, but in this way only one withdrawal of the group asks: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese are better off."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Most of the time she disappears," says the Musculoskeletal Oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil dealers were driven by the special unit of the fighting forces, they would not be arrested, but a painful smier money.
They also want to benefit from the raw material, like all Nigerians.
"This damn witness has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Founder detection of dangerous construction heaters in A380-dried works
The A380 obviously has a major security problem.
During the investigation of a notified machine, a possible construction sensor could have been detected that could lead to a "distorted trial case".
The Fluglinie Kantas wants to blame the engine manufacturer now.
The passengers of the noted Kantas-Airbus in the beginning of November had apparently been much happier than they had known so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the work of some A380 machines - and is now warning of a possible construction healer.
The potential defect could have serious consequences: in the event of an oil link, he could cause the risk of injury and leukemia, which was the opinion of the ATSB authority published on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic trial case".
As far as Rolls-Royce is concerned, tricycles are made in 20 A380 series of aircraft.
This includes the Kantas-Airbus, which had to land on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provided a basis for complaint at an Australian Federal Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows it to take further legal action against the company.
Kantas-Chief Alan Joyce said his airline will demand damage for the mid-November crash.
At the engine fire, parts had been solved and the track was damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil as a cause for the damage.
After the crash, up to 40 trials have to be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further security tests on the superjumbos that are equipped with the work concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, ATSB speaker Martin Dolan said.
The safety problem has been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the landing of the Kantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines placed about three of its Elf A380s on the ground.
The Airhansa changed the work of a A380 as a precautionary measure.
The dual-duty pilot is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
Landside snowfall clears traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Over the night, almost all the country has fallen snow.
On many roads, Chaos, trains and flights fall.
At least three people came to life in car accidents.
The winter freezes in Germany: At low temperatures, nearly the entire Republic is cut off in the night on Thursday - which leads to more traffic chaos.
In the north and east there are partly 15 cm thick snow cover.
On several roads and many roads, traffic is very limited.
At the A7 in Flensburg, the winter service was in the long run, but it was not finished with the permanent new snow.
In addition, heavy rain fell over the east coast.
The Federal Sea Ship and Hydrography (BSH) is expected at the Ossetex Coast Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning on storm flows with water stands of 1.2 metres above normal.
In Saxony, snowflakes on the roads and federal streets were causing serious problems.
According to the non-competitive media, the highest level of alarm level was expressed in the Swedish language.
In part, there were 30 centimetres of snow, fresh and strong winds that provided for movements.
There are several trucks and cars stuck there in the night.
Also in Saxony, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to shocking traffic and noise.
In Thuringen, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Train, there are serious disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringen and North Bayerns.
Snow on the hills, surrounded trees on the rocks or broken surfaces and weights are the main problems.
In Saxony the transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg was to be established.
In the Thuring Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided with firemen and rescue aid with wool blankets, food and drinks in the train.
In snow, they were trapped on the streets.
On large German airports the snowfield leads to numerous flights.
In Munich, some cancellations have already been reported by a speaker at the airport headquarters.
According to a Fraport speaker in Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been routed.
The winter service will be in the long run.
Despite having only a few beached passengers at the airport, nearly 400 fields are still ready for them.
On many roads, it has already happened in the middle of the night.
In the evening, a Lkw-farer came together with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein about life.
The locker was easily damaged.
In the vicinity of Nürnberg, there was a similar accident because of snow covered roads: a truck was also found on a train crossing, as the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver came back to life.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had moved with her car to Aschaffenburg on the smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be soft and pulverized and therefore it will already rise in light waves.
But the wind will disappear.
Only the Ossei is searched for by fast and exciting winds.
However, it remains very cold - otherwise up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her bike storm
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two offices at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could contribute to the real estate.
Firstly, the German Bank welcomed its association: Bicycles were modernized in Frankfurter Banken district; among other things, the banks were forced back to their old workplace.
But now the financial companies want to recover the cost of the renovation - and look for a buyer for the two houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes to a speaker in his speech.
Reasons for the planned sale did not tell the speaker.
"We always check whether it's more meaningful to own or sell real estate, and then take it back," he said.
In this way, Germany's largest credit institution has already withdrawn its company’s office after a short time.
The Bank had only received the double rate for EUR 272 million from the owners of a home fund in mid-2007 and subsequently managed on-the-spot.
The energy production has declined to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring much money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the doors of the newspaper listed in "Greentowers" resulting in around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are re-assessed to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, whether it is now open, the speaker said.
Thousands mourn a total of deaths
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the damaged mountain slopes that were declared after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be protected because the security layers in the accident are still warning.
Just two weeks ago, there was a heavy explosion near the town of Greymouth in the Picke River Mine.
29 mountain workers between 17 and 62 years of age were beaten down under days.
A sin had been committed in the accident, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, safety reasons did not give rise to rescue forces.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts had concluded that there was no chance of survival for the group.
The bodies could not be protected so far.
Now remember your relatives and friends with a memorial celebration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand South when the sun rose in Greymouth.
It's been two minutes.
To honor the broken mountain slopes, 29 tables were set to see the helmets, lamps and the names of the group.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes and Surfs, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were at least half.
New Zealand has hoped that the mountains "from the depths of the earth" will return to the surface, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't finish with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Laurie Drew, his son Zen was shot in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and his victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on November 19th, British and South African origins were also destroyed.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coalberg works on the southern part of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas is exhausted, it will begin to cool down the cool temperatures within the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
To Hell, fighter!
Fits space for artkino?
The director Nicolas Winding Remfn is re-examined with his fighter epos "Wahalla Rising" old genre boundaries.
What publication did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Remfn have in mind when he ran "Wallalla Rising"?
A prisoner of Viking war with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his painkillers and with almost too many forces specifically surrounds his opponent - sounds ideal for young men's visitors to search for a bloodthirsty action, just because our hero likes to beat rabies killing methods and his enemies are already getting the heat out of the living life when he has a bad reputation.
On the other hand, notes how he is actually called, the whole film is not a word, and the other figures can be quoted at least at least one or two sets or a couple of qualifiers.
Otherwise, it will be moved and it will be fought in the enormously beautiful village of Scotland, which offers the world of Vikings thousands of years ago.
Ideal more for adult cinematists with interest in existentialism and very quiet cameras.
It's nice if a movie has several target groups, it's only bad if they're off each other.
Director Winding Remfn has been using his wild and stupid drug-smoker trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to make his works available with a little more humor to the mainstream or some less brutality to the art house.
Most of the artkino friuns should be cut off from the splendour mass of brains and the heat.
The action-Fans will die no later than long ago, when, for free interpretation of reasons, a group of violent Christian missionaries are brought up on board to Jerusalem and determined an eternity in fleet and nebel before the people appear in America and move there further.
So no wonder that "Wahalla Rising" in Germany has not found a cinema rental and has just appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the beautiful images, but also because behind the pretentious fassadic to bloody fascinate, it is hidden a bit of impressive piece of Chinese, which deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogue or a stringed action, it's all atmosphere, a film-made feber space.
And from it there is no entrance for the viewers.
Refn will hardly give him a moment of relaxation and will cut him off with his expensive pictures and the window trace-artic soundtrack quite slowly the neck, but especially with the inconspicuous hair that suits him from the heart of the figures.
Only a small blue boy, who trusts the side, keeps something as innocent as it is, everyone else gets driven by iron.
The majority of the common hell, whose motive is never declared, will at any time become a warrior of the devil himself, for enemies and temporarily bound to war from hell.
He means losing, but maybe only for those without losing.
"Wahalla Rising" is a law enforcement film that you can have and admire, to care, to stand up and stand.
An experience.
Direct work on the ground
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country remains to take the position - it is still able to control it.
On Saturday, September 5, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 in combat vehicles attacked a mysterious, destructive building in Syria.
It is located on the surface of the Euphrat; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-saur.
Her name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, Syria, reportedly built with help from North Korea in the quader, is hidden in a valley that escapes from the current.
According to a letter of the US-Ausland Secret Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, it would also be appropriate to have the electric-kibar current reactor built - from which the nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technology has barely grown from the five-ziggers.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unscathed satellite images.
By computer animation, they highlighted what components of the reactor should be before the destruction, which is a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon atom centre.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from close to or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the start of the operation, it seemed, but it was still not equipped with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it is hardly known as that time, since the wheels became bigger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently explained in his memoirs that the CIA was right to build a reactor in El-Kibar, but soon found that there was an "active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe are therefore more cautious and speak only of a "acquired reactor", even if they hold the CIA presentation for "pleasible".
You don't have any hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer only answered lapidar, who the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The protection of the alleged "unused military buildings" however, the Syrians managed to destroy and plan the land fundamentally.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in El-Kibar trails of Uran, made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from a Member State of commercial suppliers from time to time following the attack that might be more powerful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these admissions are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always meant never to operate a secret atom program or have built a reactor.
The Uran is from the Israeli army, Damascus declared.
However, this was shown by the IIAA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Seither refuses to discuss it - as well as on the satellite images.
In addition, it prohibits the controllers from having a second inspection in El-Kibar and access to the drummers of the bombed building.
But Israel also weakens the ice.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was active during the attack.
The investigation of the case has been in vain since June 2008 and "increasing in the development of a serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA meeting in Vienna, is ultimately a serious obstacle to the nuclear weapons contract in the room that is waiting for the IAEA.
As a key to progress in the declaration, the IAEA sees three other facilities that should be "functionally connected" to the requiring reactor - and that are still in existence.
The inspectors have not yet opened up what plants it is doing, what function it has or what they appear suspiciously.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to as Marj as as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah in the IAEA, again driven by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified this site and established a building complex at Masyaf, where it is likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in or immediately in addition to a military support point - with this reason, Syria of the IAEA is refusing access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent from the United States to withdraw military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectors had become aware of the facilities by means of a tip of the US secret services.
The IAEA has indicated, including satellite photos, that material was transported between the three places and the square at the Euchart.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is "no reference to sensitive activities", so uranium recovery or reprocessing; processes needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
However, the reactor type is operated with uran, which is not sufficient.
But where the Uranus was to come and where later the Plutonium was to be removed for the bomb, these central questions are all subject to positive confusion.
It is also unclear whether drummers that could mount valuable tracks were stored in the three places.
If hundreds of cargo downloads were to disappear from the ground, no one wants information about where the protection remains.
The only few kilometres of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat, Salzmine al-Tibni, who has examined Syria in 1998 on its ownership as a warehouse for radioactive mills, is the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought her into contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
The comments from the Orbit show, however, that Syria took over the three suspicious places of work and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has been using several months to develop a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to carry out any military secrets - only the rise shows how much the inspectors' interest is.
Indes, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna were concerned that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been high-pressure, bringing some US messenger Glyn Davies into the game a few months ago called special inspections, one of the most difficult means the Vienna nuclear power has to carry out.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: for one, there is a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than a scalation.
To others like a diplomat is to think, "What if they don't find anything at all?"
Love in Wartime
Since Angelina Jolie started working in the summer with her unnamed director, there are concerns.
The comic book has written itself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but it's enough for rest.
The horror, the woman, a Muslim, is deeply felt during the Yugoslavian war in her Serbian rapist.
Bosnian women's unions have protested immediately, while some of the three days planned in Sarajevo were recently transferred to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is broadcast in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of women's war victims wrote about the UN refugee relief work UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actor, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is himself a messenger of the UN refugee relief work.
It is not diplomatic - she has already offered the women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, but what they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in the Administrative Camps have not given it, and Jolie's attitude told her enough about the draft.
Your organization has recommended that the UN refugee relief work leave Jolie as a messenger, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who was able to read her book, has given a request for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come yet.
The youngster himself means that they do not follow political views with their film, have worked very well in the Yugoslavian conflict, want to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains visible.
So a second synopsis on film on the network, which then sounds quite different: the lovers could already be there before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are thrown into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds quite different, though, is the variant of "Inflammation Victims of Violence".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is sure.
The pressure on her, as Jolie said, is "unfair and based on missing information".
Now you can probably only get the hacker from Hollywood peace: by putting the droid book, as many as before, illegally into the network.
Not as far as here

Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this brilliant drink game and the back-up computer that doesn't really fit together.
But the 26-year-old tries to get rid of the question of what the future will bring.
On his plan, he will not be at play in Las Vegas, which will be held in New Zealand in January.
"I have a deep feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I haven't got any work there."

100 000 Ireland is likely to leave the country in the near future, says experts of the ESRI Institute of Economic and Social Research in Dublin.
By 2015, they even estimate with 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a massive loss.
True to the predictions, it comes to a foreign village compared to those in Ireland in the 1980s.

Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to make the subject positive.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a exhibition that offers a round-up service for work abroad.
"Work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first step on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website show photos Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but it also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something, Seán O'Donovan has known for a year.
Because it was nothing more for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just take a model house high.
In January it goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home is seen by O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extras to pay the credit for his house there.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, after a long time he's gone through his house for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as ever."
He's got something left and he's going through cold rooms.
The small house is located in a nice residential area with furnished facilities, parking large, expensive cars in the streets.
Along with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380.000 euros for four years - 100 percent financed.
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could happen with the credit?
O'Donovan passes over a long, hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes on, I can start from Newe."
The construction engineer does not want to complain about what he often hears.
"No one has to hunger - our situation is not as dramatic as it was in earlier times on the island," he says.
"Work a lot abroad, which is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel it just like iron."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who has gone to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open up and simply look at how it goes with life everywhere.
A couple of years of work in London has already been behind him and why should it not also be good for him and his friend in New Zealand?
One thing, however, is that he belongs to these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could happen in a life-saving party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and drinks a great joy from his beer.
"Life, however, sounds overwhelming."
"We'd like to call it a street party, quite funny, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
To this end, the Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries was published exclusively in The Economist.
This question has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and thus reflects the exchange of views in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October in particular.
First the Good Voice in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries at the South American Pacific Coast, democratic movements have increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has been reintroduced since the strong entry in the last year, such a trend is to be recognized.
However, only half of the people in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. That is as much as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Almost 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% in its government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase over 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises were undermining efforts to increase democracy.
This also occurred during the global economic crisis, perhaps because Latin American countries have experienced only a short phase of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up with a stronger social network.
(As reported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the rate of poverty in Latin America increased only slightly and 32% fell this year.)
However, there are strong differences in voting between countries (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the different president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in an enlarged outlook.
In Mexico and Central America, where the resistance was stronger and the crime of violence was committed, this is less the case.
For the second time since the launch of the survey, many questions in Latin America in crime in their country have seen a greater problem than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a member of the family have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, as compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and reached the lowest level since 1995.
The growing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: around 71% of the respondents said that the private economy was indispensable for development in 2007 was 56% (see diagram 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in its country compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestedly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although its left President, Hugo Chávez, has been in charge of many private companies.
Brazil reported 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
In Mexico and most Central American countries, the most influential country in the United States has seen this role taken in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A selection box
Nobody expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts overemphasize the fears of the electors who contributed to the aid of the affected country.
Overfilled wafers, multiple-reduced votes, election scenes in the ring, broken elections, and insults were just part of the problem.
Elections opened with a long delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom became homeless by the earthquake in January, also sought a choice.
Some finally gave up everything.
A thousand presidential candidates, including some of the required leaders, demanded the withdrawal of the election results due to a considerable amount.
In all countries, there have been partially violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as right in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities may also be serious, the process is not necessarily invalid".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which has been entrusted to the dissident President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Celestin, will be informed of the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected choice is recommended for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial complaints of invalidity.
If Jude Celestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, is explained by the electoral authority to win the election, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earth’s victims still live in cells, a small electoral participation was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organization in the vote.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 items that were needed for the election were not yet distributed.
It's a lot on the game.
The rapporteurs considered a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Secret in the Middle East
In the weeks following your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that increased their popularity rate by more than 50% to above. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help a recovery in the next year depends on whether the seemingly sad compromiser Cristina Fernández is as her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also linked economic policy with his wife’s choice, often developed budgetary plans that did not take full account of taxes, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president's couple to issue extracts for their own benefit.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost most of the Congress in the last year.
But the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further disturbances.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Persians stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after Chaoto's meetings (in which a parliamentarian struck another face and others visited the government of the occupation), it was not possible for the Congress to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I won't discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget also applies for the next year, which gives the President more opportunity to spend money on his own gifts.
The economy runs: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official rate of inflation is 11.1%, but many private valuations and wage requirements of trade unions are estimated at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was threatened by economic crises, explained growth and poverty control to its main objectives, not inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, signed the private sector, and secured the National Institute for Statistics and Populations INDIC, which also praised official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate course now?
She called on the private economy and the trade leaders to speak.
And official statements should be limited to 18% in the next year.
The world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation is undermining the growth industry through a major devaluation in 2002.
It is possible that Cristina Fernández would, for this reason, want to re-link Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities owners who had rejected the country’s previous debt in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to have an agreement with the money providers from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused an audit by the IMF, as otherwise usual.
However, in the last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks like this would be the first step to buy the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, they need the support of the media, which is largely sufficient for Churchnerism.
When the Argentinans return in March from their summer vacation, the wells of the sympathy against you will be cut off.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she will make many political decisions and raise her husband freely.
Low appeal for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the party country.
What does Taiwan have to do with her big brother outside the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters, were elected to choose mayors and mayors in the five urban districts. This will be assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeu.
Through the construction of railway-distorting business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of the relations with the country. Her policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese Motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma's got the test, but it's just a little bit.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) has set up three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which deserves a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
This would have meant for Ma problems in a presidential election.
Since his election two years ago, the vote rate of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city hall.
During the election, it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as a train ride with Krawall Makers, flag-flagging massages, and only freshly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder test.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honor president of KMT, held a speech at the election on a KMT candidate,
when a man from the crowd struck him, lying on his face, lying on his face, and he was killed by an evil-doer.
It is not clear whether the protection of lines was intended to kill or fight with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the approach has been called Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, who has influenced the choice and has drawn the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has protected more votes.
Likely China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Notably, the relationship with the party was not thematicized.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and relieve China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not want its relations with the government in Beijing.
This time, however, the DPP also avoids the anti-Chinese feelings to be very intense.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, the majority of Taiwanese people want to confirm their Chinese policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to call Taiwan back with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent an interpreter to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, there is also a need for political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It is therefore expected to follow the presidential elections of 2012.
The DPP has found itself in the middle of a new one.
Two years ago she was very weak: the former partner, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he played a key role in the absolute independence.
However, under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of qualified politicians developed, and the DPP fought against the voices of professionals and young people.
Tsai, as presidential candidate of the DPP, found great acceptance, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party now does everything to show that she is also able to build strong relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea media as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this provides for a preliminary free discussion.
Tsai explained publicly that her party offers a "confident alternative" to Mass an early approach to China.
Chen seems very disappointed about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates had done better to be independent of Taiwan.
He even asked Praguemike Su to sign the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's admission, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to be subject to its own self-assessment.
Most values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to fight without him.
The main reasons for his lack of love seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between arms and wealth.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP can prevent Taiwan from providing only limited access.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent Columnist, "there is no more return."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was outstanding in the Newcomer category of the year
If you meet a president's request, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the 2009 Nobel Prize Prize Award ceremony at the ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer were nominated in a surprising way for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since its 2008 "Esperanza" album in the jazz scene, the nomination seems unusual. However, it is in line with the Grammy rules that an artist may have issued at least three albums before the album was published in public.
Her honored album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her excited voice and a good taste for pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding peacefully with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings next.
In addition, the "Historicity" album of Vijay Iyer Trios was named in the category Instrumental Albums. This love of the critics was a great result.
The contestant Iyers include "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positoothly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Thrombone Shorty, a fun little favorite from New Orleans and more frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in the last albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk Musicer Darcy James Argue received valuable attention in the category Great Group. So he is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurer Dave Holland and his octet, whose life album "Pathways" is a good example.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads to classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a beautiful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machine" for piano and orchestras with five votes, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", is presented as an eclectic orchestra, with three votes.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and executed in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer of L.A. Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestras, operas, choirs to solo receptions.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated in this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Malinson.
Among the famous classic albums are Bruckners Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertebouw Orchestra; Daugherts "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrate" is presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphonie Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchester and Chor of the Marinesky Theatres; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, party for Symphonie No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionateté Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Parts Symphonie No. 4 was performed and recorded in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The about 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil-mapped Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dormans "Mondolinen concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer said that he had written the 15-minute piece especially for the Mandoline artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from near east and many North African tone and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The Director Pierre Boulevez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchester Division for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumentalists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the genius Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
In this year, only women were nominated as vocalists, including Anne Sofia from Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Bruegergosman.
In the classic crossover category, Sopranistist Jessye Norman was nominated for her "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mochae in Temecula won the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temécula was followed by a five-hour public hearing, often the unanimous submission of the local planning committee.
Critics wanted to promote both terrorism and transport.
However, according to a statement made by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and becomes an aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - from Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, the head of the Islamic center of Temécula Valley, explained on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There's only a few enemies," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the building of the centre lasted almost until midnight, where the votes on both sides were distributed according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There's no more America," said one comment.
"It's another planet of the open, and the state of freedom lies in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on 11 September 2001.
In Temcula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmous called for violence.
Its community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a larger and better place than the camp that they had rented together with a producer for water filter facilities.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large mosche in Mediterranean style is to have two minerals and get about 13m high.
It is supposed to be located on the 17500 m2 large ground floor of Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still challenge the project at the city stage.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on earth or otherwise.
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can survive, including arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is their view that life is also possible without the elements that have previously been considered essential for life.
"This organization has two possibilities."
"It needs to grow either phosphor or arsenic."
"This makes it very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-author of the report appearing on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
To date, six main ingredients have been considered to be essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur.
However, as scientists have discovered, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake also grow further when it replaces phosphor by arsenic.
"But you wonder what else is possible," said Co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from the Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists have to recognize life and its forms, so to speak.
The study consists of microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were known to the discovery, allowed extensive speculations on the Internet that the report could be made of the discovery of alien life.
This isn't the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms with the help of other elements of biochemical processes can be applied and that the 'standard elements' which we consider to be absolutely vital are not provided without conditions," said Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Symon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because of the high Arbenge content.
Since Arsen and Phosphor are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes that are exposed to them could possibly replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the medicine is primarily based on the chemical nature of the medicine."
"It is therefore difficult for the organizations to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently as a phosphor. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it almost melts everything," says Anbar.
The researchers set out the bacteria GFAJ-1 to increase the concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphor, although it can survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based lifeform can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or on the moon, often occurs on the arse.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea is that phosphor can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsen came more often in early years, she says, that is why science has concluded that early life forms have used it.
"That's the reason for believing that life could have evolved differently than in the early decades," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Symon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibitions found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition halls that were stolen before a Bellflower motel were found, according to the statement of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs on Thursday.
The four exhibition sounds - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as strangers to the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were delivered before a Bellflower Motel 6 night, were reported by the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two at midnight, said Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
"The good news is: the dogs are hungry," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make accurate data on the origin of the dog nor on the circumstances that led to its discovery.
"The inventions are still running."
"We don't want to say that anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for guests.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a neighborhood in Downey in reception.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery cars and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old Russian, and Didi, a 10-month old Hündin - were reportedly unharmed by authorities.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter, the Rickard and Peek wanted to represent their Japanese owners on the competition this week, remained missing until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are on this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As the Times reported on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba show in other competitions.
South California is a stop on the almost uneven tour of the horse's pair of dog views.
Peek and Rickard checked in the hotel on Monday night.
They often spend the night in motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer waver, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with her motel room.
The smart Akitas and Corgis remained in the delivery car because it was colder there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m. as stolen.
Peek promised everyone who could give a hint to the corgis, a finding loan. The animals were introduced microchips to identify.
On Thursday, it was not yet determined whether a finding loan was paid.
The lamp is re-filled after the approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18-month turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a new Yorker competition director officially announced the "prepared" faith plan to increase the debt of $5 billion and to open the 86-year-old maintenance company's way for new films and television shows.
According to the announcement of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US competition law, so that the refurbishment of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglas Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be appointed as the leading business leader of the film.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to around 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 is actually in force only if JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM products.
At the moment, an investment bank’s firm’s own fund fund is going to be paid by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio started in May 2009 with the mandate of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company's company leader who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the business leader Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring experts, who was known for his activities at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the finances of MGMs and to pay out more than 140 believers of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction took only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the believers.
In the spring of this year, everything began before the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was signed by the believers at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially exceeded the competition in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid monthly for the company’s management of $375.000, receives a "follow-up bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. In this year, the studio carried out only one film and created a annual plan with seven or eight films to come into the cinemas in early 2012.
In addition, they plan two films for "The Little Hobbit" in Co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films that are to be produced under the reign of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholders he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Video console. Both games can play a significant role in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX rows for $99, while the price for a kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic Springs or about 48 doses Play Doh.
But you can already have your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic games in $80 three national players - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I was immediately told that the Moores Law was in force. This year the technology machines are more efficient and at the same time less than in the last year.
And although few new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous type, website and Club Penguin.
More and more button-worked toys come on the market, and many contain rechargeable accuses.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are as large as seaweeds that sing a note when you press on their roof.
Once you press a note, you can play a song by multiple clicks.
Several Sing-a-ma-Jigs sang in Harmony.
Attention: If you have started with the pressure once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of messages and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animonical poppe exchange games such as 'Symon' are provided, and thanks to the innovative snowflakes with radar blocking, they control the moon wave.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dancer. However, their parents complain about the lack of sound control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you must remember Alpha, one of the first computerized learning tools.
Now he's back there (hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children from 3), with a full head of question cards, which can be a car ride to an hour of instruction, with a better driver with self-correction function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child’s smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most affordable and user friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included are not as teachable as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is the first major reprocessing of the Leapster line with a new, bright screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older tapes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card work, family photos can also be viewed.
In good time there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string of wood and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to combine the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is a great deal suitable for an improvised written competition.
More and more players have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the games fields, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online time in the Penguin Club, for example a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will get enough credit for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
It can be roll shoes or a puffle stuff.
The latest head cell-operated microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The buyer quickly moves to 12 vibrating silica legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an iron gate.
And he's holding out something.
Our fall from the kitchen and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police stations in China will be more comfortable
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walks through a city square, inspects his nervous subjects, and gives them orders with military authority and a broken voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust growers of the city order, to be honored and remembered for their willing races and their commitment to violence - to impress the visitors.
"Get up!"
"Look out!"
"Give them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls did not grow up to the teen age, with white handshake and identical olive-green Jacks and Hosen.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four orderly Heats in perfect on the hair held with blue-white strands.
"They look at me in the middle," noted Mr. Tang with appreciation.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to raise the image of Chinese city inspectors.
In one city, all new competitors have to have a high school term.
The province of Guangdong instead of the Gragrins introduced a light blue uniform.
Wuhan replaced violence by Dutch stars in mid-China: In 2009, 50 officials reported crossing reports and attacked the operators until they packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city area in Chengdu with 660,000 inhabitants, wants to substantially change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened urban police officers. They have been selected especially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gravel police a narrow, feminine aspect.
However, it would hardly be possible to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of this city's command.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials can only apply the urban laws with money or other administrative penalties.
The Chinese media, however, show a different picture routinely.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei examined a visitor to death when they filmed with his phone how they launched a protest against a millennia.
In the last year, a school manual was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be prosecuted without blood loss.
In this year, a Shanghai watermeleon dealer will experience a mixture of five official brain damages.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan makes the government fear," lamented China Daily's national newspaper in the last year, after further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real basic soaping".
The current approach is clearly insufficient.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as optical relaxation.
Probably both.
According to the report, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for with good figure and "harmonic eye drops".
They should be oversized - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women is too demanding for more than 25 bodies.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district officer at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial hair, etc."
Then heat and "our qualities".
"Every Chengguan is like flowers," he said, adding, "but besides, they have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, head of the city administration of the district, did not want this description to be understood,
However, it added that in China size standards are not impossible in terms of positions for both sexes.
The same applies to similar facial cramps.
Whether to compare it with a good look, it is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical solutions do not need to compete.
"We can't use any lavender or bucklings here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolled on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has a well formed mouth.
She didn't feel like seismic that such a great value would be placed on her appearance.
"Can I see out in this uniform sexy?" she asks with ironic look.
Her colleague, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the city's image."
As a result, they do not regret the brief setting, since they had more honest career plans, as just to shoot dealers through the gas to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning, the train consists of about twelve road dealers who are trying to sell as many bridges and accessories as possible before continuing.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've already told you so often!" said Mrs. Xu, a dealer who was flying on foot and had temporarily left his naked kitchen on a bicyclecar.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than demanding.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studied in the time of free distribution.
"All Routine."
One reason is that female officers should not confiscate the goods of the dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only drive criminals to report their male ancestors.
This is to protect them from public assaults that are often exploited by officials in China.
In this year hundreds of citizens of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, had been randomized after the funeral, were killed by Chengguan officials.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured during the night accident, 14 government vehicles were refurbished or burned in the fire.
Xindu has since disappeared from such violent acts.
But sleep is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square where the female officers were patrolled this morning gathered over 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired in a workshop instead of against the rules on the road to the city.
The owner screams Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute drive, the officers walked on the road to their vehicles and went on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the men's ranks, remained back. He turned his white nickname back to remain anonymous.
How their colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supportive role.
But they were not meant to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going to talk."
"Sometimes but also physically," said Mr. Li next.
"Most of the time, the people started fighting."
State attorney is not charged Senator Ensign
The state prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensin, have been released from charges that, after his case with an ex-elector and his attempt to get her husband an act of lobbying against him, gave notice to the senator's attorneys on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most difficult draft against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused a country-wide strike and replaced his career, he was considered a potential presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns of the Office announced, he was "highly pleased" after the one-year investigation.
However, the ethics committee of the Senate could still hold a disciplinary order.
According to Ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been filed and that no further complaints had been filed in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to go outside the case.
The trial was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. Your opinion was given sufficient evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other submissions first opened in October 2009 in the New York Times allowed Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistant, to proceed with lucrative orders to purchase his Swiss business with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during an election campaign of signs as a chess champion.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the records and audiences, he took over for them after Hamptons Lobby's job.
As Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he had not been able to take a lobby job for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to Ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case, was against the so-called ban on Drehtür Lobbykraty.
According to the published index, "it seems to be all about a speech and the confusion of the three-state states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the protection of clients who are in the government's visit.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to give reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics officials said that the ministry seemed very cautious in the pursuit of political complaints after a number of minors that had been followed by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to let the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens fall due to the lack of conduct of the state attorney.
The state prosecutors "sid openly schreckhaft", Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US Parliament and Government circles), said that a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr Ensign before the court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now conclude that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defense of Mr Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a government official on Monday and another day that he was told that the ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns had cooperated with the state attorneys to convince them that the senator, as his office continued in a statement on Wednesday, "has acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins urged us to clarify the legal arguments he had made against the state governments.
"I am not sure how to go into the details of the discussion between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just as it was said, we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
In the past month, the Federal Election Commission has decided to set up the findings on the basis of a separate complaint by the ethics group following a payment of $96,000 by Mr Ensigns Parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act.
The election commission said that it did not give enough evidence that the money had been something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large firm in Nevada, which has long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyist-Work.
An e-mail from December 2008 reported that, after the company passed on Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Staff Chief, John Lopez, had a training with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was in the Ministry of Internal Affairs because of a case of "encourage".
Mr. Ensin also agreed with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, on Wednesday, and asked the Minister for Transport to agree to a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up a lobbying project.
In the last year, for the first time, information on these affairs was made available to the public, Mr Ensign decided to present himself to his voters and gave his position in the Senate where he had been in the hands of the Republicans in four places.
After he had not been up for many months, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he wanted a third office time in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr Ensign was no longer the target of police investigations, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, expressed the hope that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up its findings.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls focus on Twitter
Half a dozen of them went to the Krawalds in court.
In the minutes, they sent their reports on Twitter about the horrors of the witness.
At the end, such protection, there were more than 14,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds in a house that appeared in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the claim for the death penalty issued by the jury falls.
However, Mr Hayes' attorneys have already filed applications to the Court for grounds for appeal and the court will be held for years.
One of the most exciting reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process - including through the extensive use of Twitter by media reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and so wide that there has been an extensive cross-examination of exciting details, so that the jury has been adversely affected by public equipment.
This claim could allow appeal courts to deal with the question of whether new rules are needed in the Court of Justice.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is a real risk when the introduction of new technologies into the Court of Justice affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes chief advocate.
The President, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, showed the application for a decision a few weeks ago and kindly returned when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been subjected to torture.
But that was not the last word in this case.
For decades, court proceedings have established that the reporting of outstanding cases has led to doubts about the validity of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife and said in his decision that because of the new media, there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the court".
Some believe that the television series and the game film "On the flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers said that the court's claims that Mr Hayes' judgment had been considered half a century later might follow the argument that new rules had been necessary to regulate the means of communication from the court that were still inexplicable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media on processes that are followed by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting a communication from the Court of Justice could make the process worse.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who represent Mr Hayes' lawyers to discuss over the years and therefore make a judgment.
The defenders also claimed that Mr. Hayes could have already been prejudged, as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential juryes by showing them funny tattoo photos during the jury election.
Some of the jury said, photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had met with abortion.
The defenders said that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge had deliberately exchanged a jury that had been a critic of the government, and that he would have had an unacceptable pressure on the court if he had made the impossible decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a court case they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election fight for the government office and for the American Senate of the candidates.
They argued that the new media would continue to have renewed the flame of emotions over the case.
"A daily appetite for media spies, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyers wrote, "you've been in New Haven before and maybe not even in the country."
Your focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages would be more dangerous than reports that would be easier to replace is a technically hostile view that would undermine the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellation courts would often be opposed to the argument, and social and technical changes were needed by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyer reinforces this claim.
In their submission they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the judgment of Dr. Sheppard was raised on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media need new rules.
"This case," she writes, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st Century."
Canality connect the trender?
After a campaign on skiing words and negativeity, this week was slightly broken in Washington.
Is there a real double-party cooperation or an illusion moment before you return to fight the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not interfere with the major issues with which one had to deal with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government, in which decisions were no longer taken.
After all that you hear, there was no formal discussion between two different sides nor any observation of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial assembly.
The public meeting of the Committee on Defiction of Presidents on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist among the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that leads to the ideological gap that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while attempting to consider the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that would have prevailed in the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, expenses, health or expectations, both sides are miles away from each other.
At the very least, the November election Washington voted slowly for a short time.
"No question has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is impossible after elections.
Elections develop partial passions that cease again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republican and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution."
Bush tax reductions at the end of the year, and no one argues.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even everyone, whether it is temporary or permanent.
It is also a compromise with regard to increased unemployment, even if only because the Republicans can't afford it, that they believe the favoured tax reductions for the rich, while they are unemployed.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can ratify the new START Treaty in these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the Lame duck session" does not have to lead to a sustained cooperation of the parties when the new 112.
Instead, as he says, a phase of the non-stop voting is likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that must be done, this short-term psychology will be transformed into a confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this creation is shared by many - leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot from today to 2012, as a front fight, or shadow boxes, for the 2012 event," he said.
The reasons for this are very much to do with the taste of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were responsible for their education.
As the Republican leaders may also be concerned that they are too high poker, they know they have to try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and to put the health reform beyond their control.
These parties are already in the first reaction to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the addition of certain taxes, as well as the suspension of interest rate and the reduction of State expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own estimates, have been so forced to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan for official recommendation and they fight very hard to get close to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the board, since in financial questions, at least today, there is only a little playing room or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston foretells two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place in the form of party meetings next year when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes and the health system, followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that despite the participation of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If a conflict occurs in a tank gas as it occurred in 1995, both parties must pay attention to the public response.
Anyone who is always sentenced to loss will have to change the course and find the compromise.
This may actually be an optimistic view.
Participation and polarization are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than in his time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 see as a clear example of a wide-ranging selection of the 2012 consequences.
So many Americans may be welcomed by this week's privacy.
However, on both sides it will require much more fun to find a common speaker in the questions that the two still differ as before each other.
Secure US document portraits Moscow as the door of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "Cleptocratie" and it has a part of the settlement money and the protection money it collects on the Kremlin. So in February, the American message in Russia was reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service express high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal gangs.
Each shadow of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called as "vertical authority" - takes part in the money that the leader goes up.
The memo, sent under the name of the messenger John Beyrle to Washington, was published on his website on Tuesday by WikiLeaks.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and it blamed him for corruption.
He was burned in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he would have been raised in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who own a known construction company, have repeatedly repeated corruption claims over years, and has won numerous complaints against such charges.
In September he explained a Russian television transmitter when he was asked for a document that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's drunk, it's dirty."
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That has led to questions.
But it is unusual that, as in the messenger's report, individuals are called, and it is not heard that this is happening by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the government of Moscow with crime has led some to refer it as "damaged" and conclude that the government is more like a cleptocrat as a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/Mafia, which means "Dach" or protection), which is also extended through the police, state security (FSB), the service oversight authority (MVD) and the government office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a threefold structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzzkov is in Stelle's office."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow the lower level."
"This is an incompetence system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap, because the city does not offer any help."
The report further states that the FSB money is being spent by the largest companies and that the police arrest small business people.
A source, it is said, "Moscaus explained that it is best to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have not only weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as required as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very clear; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly because of one condition or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken about combating corruption, but at the same time noted that he has only made little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men who went to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must leave himself to the bureaucrats," said Georgiy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a division of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
On the other hand, Russia's corruption is estimated to cost more than $300 billion a year.
The country is founded on place 154 a new study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are listed as "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The reconnaissance of the memos of the American message, which took place in later times after Moscow, will certainly resolve the problems within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistake, it may also be a possibility for the Kremlin to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a falsification and responded to the assumption that American diplomats named him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and so unethical and manner, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to face the past
In a low-lighted, bilingual classroom with soft and revealing walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it to the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he fought for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge-Hochburg village in northern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, where he has developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitalization against the government, long-term accessions to Anlong Veng are required.
In April, a local Truth and Debt Forum allowed the victims to face the public confrontation with the people who supported the regime first.
In June the government distributed a school book that told the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a Community tribunal of UNO and Cambodia first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison by the former chief of the famous Tuol Sleng Folk Room, Kaing Khek Iev.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veteren Alnlong Vengs increased, and their efforts to weaken and reintegrate in Cambodia's society.
"There is still denial and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization seeking the regime.
"For her life was glory under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits itself into the family."
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were executed or died in diseases, overwork or before hunger.
When the Vietnamese entered and the Polish Pot-Ied government invaded in 1979, the remainder of the regime and its military flew to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement capitalised, restless.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of war from their base in the west of the mountains and the jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok took the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN peace agreement promoted by 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge wars began to pass over to the government, leading to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Kieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not followed, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangerous Mountains.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he waited for his trial.
When their masters no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters flew into the harrowing poverty of the rural Cambodias and many held the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they dropped their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capitalisation," said Sok Long from the Centre for Justice and Debt, which is held throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Weng, public forums
"They are rooted in the utopian agrarianology of the regime."
"They grow up without any professional knowledge."
So Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in Dschungel about Anlang Veng before he died in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveler.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"To Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we need to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
In the beginning of the next year, the court will try to present Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
It is the duty of the Court to condemn the older leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the fines, but it is not said whether further action is being taken on these four cases.
This has helped a little to calm the worst in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, which had been in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the officials of Cambodia's Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably died in the thousands of forced workers.
On a hot night, I returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Weng.
When the sun's long shadow on the lost grass was slowed down in the chaem to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had passed her, she would have refused to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"No more persecution, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was fled by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would be more suspicious, although experts and historians would discuss this.
"Kambodsha has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, says Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Resurrection with the Khmer Time means a mixture of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything."
The center created the first school book approved by the government about the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "The History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know only a little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family takes many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are judged by the court."
Such resistance makes the slowing process complex and complicated, says Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court get after and after influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge here still has a powerful attraction.
Up in the dangerrek mountains, one of the torrents of excess and plastic-dried roads leads to a rectangle of black red, covered with a red roof.
Paul Pots Corpser was burned here after his death in 1998 at a railway station.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a telephone salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots, where she's going to set up a bus passer banana - in the hope that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus is agreed to collect non-weapon-free uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign on global nuclear security, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that no longer a high-level Uranus will be collected, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton, with Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security case.
The U.S. government had been trying to convince Belarus of this, to collect no more high-quality uranium and possibly to have reached a shelter last spring.
However, U.S. government officials told Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been reached to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Swiss research agency.
This prepared the stage for the convention on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who, due to the sensitivity of the topic, remains anonymous, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations" since April, which had been concluded in Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really impressed by the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear security gate (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Lugo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all pre-clear nuclear material.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to free their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A thousand countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation would never be set up its Uranus.
"How to maintain highly armed uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is essentially armed, and less armed uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"That's our raw material... we're not gonna make any dirty bombs and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago, Belarus approached the United States when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first move to remove the Uran white Russia in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily depleted, says the official.
It was released in a special suit, which has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian store and disposal factory for, says the official.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was conducted by air officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these coins, with a large part of the money flowed into the White Russian research with a weak uran that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build confidence," led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Biniewski, a representative of the Energy Ministry working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Continual Studies estimates that in this year, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium as well as hundreds of pounds of highly armed uranium.
Belarus intends to resolve its stocks by 2012 in accordance with the common agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, firstly due to the recent abuse of human rights by Lukashenkos.
But the state of midweek suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, as the United States of America and Belarus recognises that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says.
No objections from the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as produced by an U.S.A. ambassador's telegram in Madrid.
This reflects the documents submitted by Wikileaks and the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former Deputy Governor-General María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish government be informed "to ensure that foreign aircraft flying Spain be properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which aid to human rights-based practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American emissaries Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega were discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government said that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in his absence" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this regard.
"The La Vega signed, Spain has no objections to the secret service flights across the Spanish state area."
"They just want to be informed," says Aguirre per cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the messenger that the Spanish Government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence since they are placed in the hands of the judges."
On the other hand, the government lawyer Vicente González explained in January 2007 that he would not be able to block the right initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"This report does not contain any harmful or sensitive information," the messageer explained after a conversation with the government official.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about the "problem coordination between the Spanish Government and the German Government" than about the declassified information from the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will be complicated by our efforts to deal with discrepancies between governments," Aguirre laments.
On a Wednesday in March 2007, when the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were constantly considering their independence and doing what they considered appropriate," he gave his employees instructions "to avoid explosive rhetorical comments to let the tension go."
The messenger also expressed his concern about how the PP acted in this regard.
"In spite of its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that PP will not doubt that the government of Zapateros can have actions of the United States that could have been tolerated, tolerated or ignored as possible as possible by human rights violations, even if these assumptions could have a negative impact on the US government," he said.

When the young woman went to the Balearics to look at the labour market, the young woman stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week after Palma.
But from the content of their messages, they can conclude that their relationship of love is broken and they break apart.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very owner and animal, because I have come to work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now he notes, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address to send the boys to you."
She complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boys with my mother, I'll shoot him when I get back."
In May she says from her return to her village: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because I have to introduce myself to work on 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She says she's taking her first birthday when everything's going well.
"He will be with the one whom he has to be, that is with me. I will not leave him in life with someone other than my mother," a double intention if you consider their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, it will be said that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was killed on the 10th is to be killed.
"On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, not on the other hand."
"On the one hand, he likes me and the place, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She speaks from a turn to Mallorca.
"There he (the young man) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for children."
At 17: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, like, a mistake."
On the 30th, one more: "The boys are going well. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there's one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had a personal blog in MySpace, which is now closed, where she called herself "Muki, the prison camp".
"Terror a la gallege (Overwriting) ".
The last man who lived with her, a ashamed hunter, explains to have a conscience, because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a unique mother.
Monica was transferred from the court centre to Menorca in the province of Palma yesterday.
The debtor, Carlos Maceda, explained that they could not remember the execution of the case, "and they did not have the intention to add the small damage."
Before that, however, she had been able to comfort Caesar in the Badewane and to have his body buried in a cave.
Protection and state administration called for a psychiatric attitude.
Partido Popular won 4 sessions in Congress and lost PSC 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and votes in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on Parliament's elections - or not. Its expectations are more positive than they are, because the number of votes reached by this party in these elections is normally as high as those in the Catalan elections.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in favour in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 voted.
If this rising trend - the result of the conversion of the PSC's vote and the binding of the PP's election - is to be maintained, the PP's analyst predicts that the PPC of 8 to 12 Congressarians could be raised in Parliament's elections, while CiU will also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (from 25).
These calculations relate to the fundamental importance of Catalans for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member of the group – now it has three – while the ICV could hold its members or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next term will fall with the joint elections in May 2011. The People's Party (PP) can also be on the move to prepare the socialist leadership for an end, namely in four provincial cities and with most of them in Barcelona City, one of the city's most budgeted administrations: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists are not able to reach a majority of their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debate, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Community, where it had to reach 5% of the votes.
The PP recorded an increase in its voting proportion in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that the main trolls in Tarragonas can be played around. There they had ruled before the present mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
A Lérida lies only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ross, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election struggle they meet several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party could mark a significant increase.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and seeks to develop lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell concerned Al Qaida thousands of passengers
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the police officers of the Barcelonas police station were arrested by Pakistani and Nigerians who formed the dschyhadist cells controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Move for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taba" (Let) - the last author of the attacks in Bombay, who requested 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister shows the importance of these investigations, which goes so far as to ensure that with the "Operation Campai" the "Operation Campai" the Falsing Device Al Qaidas has become "fashioned" worldwide and "with their ability to act".
The researchers conclude that in the two years in which the cells were active, thousands of passengers were sent to Thailand, where they fell in love and then to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was formed, so that their "wars" could pass beyond the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not only the dschyhadist network that was active in Europe, which is why other European police units have also been involved in research in addition to the Thai research bodies. It is not to be excluded that there will be similar attacks on the EU's territory in the coming days, such as those on the last service day in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistaner Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) was arrested in Thailand, where Pakistani Pakistani Muhammad Athhar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Syrianlaya Kijbumung were arrested.
They had led Bangkok from the low-level cells in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of which was made late in 2009 - was particularly popular among tourists in accordance with the standards of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This meant that the documents were issued on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 and were still valid for several years; they were not allowed to display a visa stamp.
In the investigation trials, it is stressed that no connections between those established in Catalania and the attack in Bombay have been shown, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups who were stolen in Spain and then in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars were sent to the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", who prepared for the life of 106 people.
The police have filed extensive documentation.
PP requires Mas to cancel the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present personally their terms of support for his office as President of the Generality. These are not different from those already in the electoral struggle and may be accompanied by the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence centres, such as a financial agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to the safety of Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 delegates she had won on the last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel unforgettable. Because the candidate from the civil-regional party CIU is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties is involved in voting at the hearing.
The future alliances that regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible understanding with the PP.
With regard to the PPC's party president, he asks that all the talks concerning the sovereignty and independence of the Catalan authorities and an agreement on the financial imbalance between the state and the autonomous region - as in the Basque country - and that the CU's party will even submit a referendum.
Both political leaders are common to make the growing political equipment of the regional administration easier and want to remove the taxes on inheritances and gifts.
With the details of the negotiations on the entry into force of Mas, the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are dealing with outside of the PPC.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a strong opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The Old Testament confirms that the deaths are not to be brought back to "missing measures"
The owners of the old home in Olot do not conclude that her guardian killed over eleven older people
The senior police officer La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday showing the damage to the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmés - the prosecutor who had killed at least eleven people responsible for his work.
The leader of the senior police, Joan Sala, was brought before the court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths)," but "the right and our obligation to take responsibility for the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a social loss because it did not establish the criminal actions of the victim in a timely manner, but also pay a high amount of damage calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victim.
Joan Vila Dilmé believed that the first crime returned in August 2009 and that he had been killed more since then.
The judge arranged for the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the Old Law Department - because he argued that no doctor had personally investigated the dead, but the formalities were made telephonely due to their age and disease.
The leader of La Caritat took this point along the way and explained that "unsustainable measures could never have been the reason for the events."
The Lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the law of a person other than the accused in the dispute."
The baptism was already preceded by eleven murders and declared that the first crime took place on 29 August 2009 and that within one month later the second old lady was killed.
In this case, he died with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had taken a mixture of various medications.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the staff's access to the medications is only difficult to control.
The insulin sprays and the restrooming cocktail were used by the nurse to release patients from their suffering when six of the nine were committed.
But the results of the laboratory tests will be shown whether Vila lied and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or if he burned them out of the inside by dissipating them, as he had done with three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat there is no belief in the statements of the prosecutor, not even in the case of the number of alleged murders that could be more likely. This setting is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it does not make any sense to change his practice after eight successful murders.
They say that they have made themselves available on this basis and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
The European Central Bank (ECB)’s drawbacks
The investors reacted yesterday to the pressure of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risks of the euro pean countries have increased dramatically and the European banks' shares have increased by more than 5%.
At the same time, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can hide itself and that the euro has not reached points of concern.
The events of the morning are typical of an illiquid market, which is to the extent that it repeats itself, however due to the conclusion of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional officer will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, so that tomorrow the ECB will have to return to the fourth time in two years, and perhaps several more times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the completion of the plan to purchase State debt, as it was ineffective, as well as the suspension of all exceptional delayed liquidity measures. It should be kept only a weekly uninterrupted access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the four-year terms with unlimited access to the fourth quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June will be maintained.
We also expect the programme to continue to purchase obligations and to issue a strong signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be repeated from yesterday and if we are forced to return our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed that it did not take into account the purchase of State debt securities and that the markets could continue tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and necessary.
In May she showed the teeth, and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot of money, with which she experienced a new collapse of the market.
Last night, the auction of one year's government in Portugal was very weak.
The government administration accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell at 30 base points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in market perception in terms of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt burden of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10,000 million short-term and possibly 15 000 more. There is time until February for private capital to be created or these banks to be disclosed.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it did not know the problem with the stress test in July, the figures in the framework of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the Government must receive parliamentary consent to its new budget plan, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel designed her speech on the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There is a political unit asked to show that we play the same party together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are the nine-year-old Sinfonia Beethovens.
The President of the Spanish Government presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Rent reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, the development of government deficits, liberalisation, privatization and employment-related measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldis four-year-olds in the ears of investors.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish beer has grown by 4.5 percent, doubles as much as the rest of the European beer.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government agency that will draw benefits from the trichet effect. Therefore, we put on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to reciprocate.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be self-esteem action.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The cost range has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are too expensive and the access to the markets would be free of charge.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the Moto César's wife: "Now it is not only that he is, but also that of the shadow."
All right, we'll make it!
The President of Eulen shall, at the request of his child, close the Society's meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, did not disappear.
David Álvarez, the founder of the company, will be the company assembly of El Enebro, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he holds them "inexhaustible". His children will try to get a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Weinguts Bodegas Vega Sicily.
David Álvarez and his children, Jesus David and María José, are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their fight to control a part of the corporate group.
The reason for the greatest maintenance of business services does not seem to be ready to follow the control of El Enebro's organs in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Administrative Board by five of his seven children, who were appointed to the Administrative Board members at the Administrative Board meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered in the Trade Register.
The Social Assembly of El Enebro, which was convened by Judge No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th anniversary, has released a new Donnerschlag in the shadow of the family Álvarez.
The call by the Director for the advice of the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the inclusion of the Assembly.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be set up by David Álvarez as a "confident means of the applicant - his five children - to allow for the recognition of the illegal assembly of 18 January" as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the arrival of the assembly in the vicinity to explain it as "absolutely unnecessary".
The same protagonists who slammed themselves into discrete Sweden have tried successfully in June to establish a meeting on a fair path.
At El Enebro - Property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other real estate values - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
However, the basis of the service group requires family protocols to be used more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter that the judge has decided on in the hearing to deal with the initiation complaint for which no date has been established.
Red Bull sees in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull 2004 entered the world of Formula 1, her story has been told in this University of the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave the Neuling observation and despite its rising trend during the last season, all on the win of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso on the final November.
Without the ability of the German pilots and World Master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "heavy weapons" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in his hands, and thus a winning team became a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company carried out in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with authors.
This software called PLM was used for the development of Montagket cards in factories around the world, energy tools and high precision instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid such error and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of cameras from Canon, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Sigfried Russwurm, director of the Siemens Industry Department, explains that using this software in formula 1 - Fabrik Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that are made on the race and on the test.
Russwurm suggests that in 1992 there were between 10 technicians who could introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bulls team, 180 high-quality young people are employed today. With powerful EDV systems, they are conducting analyses and all possible changes to the race cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine that is responsible for only Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred through progressive production facilities and high-tech cars within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that can spend a formula 1 - team for its competitions in a season.
Red Bull has built his hightech factory for the development and production of his race car in a 50 km away from London.
It is about two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that's going on there is Top Secret.
The facility includes 580 persons, including the two pilots, the World Master Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls is true formula 1 - Hell is certainly the newest master Sebastian Vetell.
Other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their knowledge is zero, are behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer puts in the service of its participation in the race routes.
The technologist of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in the F&E field for race cars contributed 50 percent to win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology makes 85% of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that vettel and webber can never be replaced by EDV because they “are not expected gladiators”.
HP will open its own countries in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) left his first exclusive load in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes last night in Barcelona.
It is the first of twenty-sale sales network with 80 to 100 square metres each, which aims to open the multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees with the existing 16 sales areas in the multi-market industry, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy president of HP España, Helena Herrero, announced, for example, the built-in cargo at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, which has been working with the HP for thirty years.
The North American Company Group aims to set up 200 sales stations in Europe by 2010 and 20 of them in Spain.
The first weeks were spent in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr Herrera did not want to report the upcoming openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The Vice-Presidents, who is also the leader of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for opening up is always the same. They support a local dealer with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American corporate group tells about this and takes over the exclusive loading equipment (with interactive products to be included). All countries in Europe will look alike.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the loading staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not about a French system and pointed out that with the exclusive sales network, "the customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing and then optimising the packaging."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds a connection to the Technical Centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve in ten minutes problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as private customers, as the major companies have already completed their services contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herro said yesterday.
Sababell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'kluen'
The business leader of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than any other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but begins with a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he sees an increase in interest rates that the banks are trying to compare with increases in the fees and prices for loans.
Sabadall expects to hire a million private customers in three years - a still more existing business.
Sababell has found the way to explore the coming three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year leadership plan for 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without receiving public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000 if the customers who lose the bank - this is the major challenge facing this bank because they have so far focused on their customers as their private customers.
In this year it has access to 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Your market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers make up more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, said austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks have been able to set and publish in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has brought together all the plans of the banks around the world.
This year, Sababell will conclude its plan of guidance for Optima four years ago. It was originally issued for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended for a year.
The customers who are left behind the savings are the main target of the bank.
In an early morning organized by the APIE, Guardiola, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with great wealth".
The manager goes out of it, Spain only comes "long" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "to create work" - essential for the survival of banks.
Even if it appears that the Passiva war - which will punish the interest margins - is to be abolished, the risk claims that banks and savings will have to be paid for their emissions for liquidity will have to be paid, compared to fast profit savings already at the price of credit.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will be printed on credit."
"We haven't turned the Hahn, but the interest differences are very high," said Wardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto had already ordered its branch network to limit the payment of long-term loans and to increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the statute of "increasing the charges", however "under one of the frameworks of competition".
Sababell's lead plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
It does not, however, ensure that "greater companies are needed in Spain."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He points out that the need for capital is now "great" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions are breaking up in red numbers.
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace the money market with capital savings.
After ensuring that Sababell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he raised the argument of some bankers, who have already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be done, but in contrast to the events in June, short-term funding could be obtained on repositors and thus the crisis would be halted.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of cracks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, wondered yesterday about the possibility of a merger of the cracks and stressed the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the focus process of the Spanish cracks began, several crackers were not involved in the first phase. They were held in front of the second round.
However, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director-General of the Spanish Sparkas Association (CECA), would not take place in the second round.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been closed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was much more about adaptations."
"The largest part is finished. It may be that we have instead of seventy-three or fourteen, but all important processes are already complete. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has been strongly supported by all the processes."
In an early morning organised by the business leader and manager Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarrieta pointed out that the concentration process "has been completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely departure, which has not been established in the framework of the business plan with Banco de España in the past", he stressed.
"The transition of 45 broken-offs with an average of 28,000 million assets on 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unprecedented process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 per cent and they are now much larger than we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta explained that "there are a number of unexploded opinions about the length of the process, the uncertainty and inconsistencies", because "Banco de España advises us to close the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the richest financial systems of Europe and perhaps the whole world, and added that those who doubt the existence of this "no deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic context, we need to make "no worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings that have undergone a "very important" concentration process, which will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very good records of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro but at the same time set conditions for the European Union as a whole.
The tensions on the markets have doubled the government's response.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, starting with tax arrangements for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of temporary workers or suspension of the 426 Euro support for unemployed persons, which do not relate to unemployment, until 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of the Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 per cent of the state Lotteries.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these events to be understood?
It is assumed that the brand position is no mistake in its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the euro's new definition.
In this regard, Germany introduces a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which is collating with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partner.
In view of the resistance in Europe, in Germany three possible approaches to the crisis are being explored.
The first: a stronger euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries had to leave the euro area in the south.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it is now listening to science fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Third: a reorganisation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; discipline of countries that exceed the standards; possibly setting up certain countries as well as extending the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been drawing from time to time. That is why there is no reason now.
First of all, both the IWF and the European Commission have created incentives for deficits and the German Government has launched a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the co-operation between what Germany had to do for the purpose of maintaining (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the central European country, as a sign of the decision to save Greece.
It was strongly criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely opposed to a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last October, Markel comes out with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union Agreement to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time obliges private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was expressed as an anti-European, as it preceded the Irish crisis and all the following.
However, its proposal, even if something is missing, has been adopted, and we will be involved in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think too much of it.
It is said to all that - even if unfavourable measures must be taken now - it will no longer be given the old way of functioning of the euro.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the neighbouring countries are severely punished, which may be forced to declare themselves able to pay, and in this case the private sector must take part in costs.
Germany shows us that we need to put in place a strong growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption reduction, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external payments.
The other alternatives that are based on debt and construction with serious losses in the balance of payments, as they were introduced by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken into account.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do worse than not understand it.
It is not just about lowering the state deficit by three per cent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we can do under these conditions is to blame ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will go more quietly.
And that we will be using the opportunities that are offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has the same understanding, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after discussion with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) shows that despite the criticism of Markel, the mortgage has created an order in his own house to prepare his way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
Among the possibilities taken into account is that we must not exclude the euro area completely closed with small countries.
In this case Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and exercise
Tricks, like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax, show the invention spirit, but not the will to turn a penalty.
The conclusion given by two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game on November 23nd against the Ajax in the League champions led to the loss of many hints about whether or not it was an unsportable action or not and whether both players should be punished by the UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the gameland (their team had already been clearly won) and played several fans to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid group would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanctions at the next League game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee condemned the trainer of the Club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often encountered in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this kind of sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who presented in his Hymne Edelmut and honor and, on other occasions, punished his players for similar events) played the main role, and on the Dramatization by Mourinho, which has added an episode to his long history as a theatricist and provocator.
In any case, the debate is based on whether these non-expressively prohibited behaviors are contrary to the principles of sport, which means that these actions constitute a regular approach. In fact, these practices refer to the statutes of sport, but they seem to change their meaning.
In this case, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sport spirit protects the physical incompatibility of the player, a aspect that has not been threatened by these actions, because it was no aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the abusers taking an improper advantage of the opposite team. Neither did that happen.
The paradox of the action of the real Madrid player is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regulation, because the context of the rule has not been secretly completed to avoid a penalty, but should be as frequent as possible so that it is punished by the judge.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanctions.
Another question is what kind of advantage would be given to the traitors from the intentional fraud.
Here, it should be noted that the rival was not put in a more unsatisfied position, nor were the benefits of the game lost, as the obvious result of this action was that the team itself had to continue playing with fewer players.
There is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not then have this player.
The advantage is clearly that the players start the next stage of the Championships League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree unknown, as the team could at any time be different. Furthermore, the players receive a penalty in this manner and go through the second card cycle, where they are separated by a card with a card less than in the first cycle.
This is not as clear as it really is.
Finally, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions to derive the greatest benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to impose a penalty (that would actually be a clear case of regularity), they wanted to choose more when they were subject to it.
They will make a strategic decision without imposing a penalty or flying before them.
Although the margin between the acquisition and the settlement is confused, I believe that in this case it is a clear case of the acquisition.
I have the impression that Poland was created by two factors: because it went about two separate conclusions and because of the nature of the regulated regulation.
The damage that has been added to the principles of sport through these actions is less ethical than much more aesthetic.
Anobotoffensive to customers for group weddings in Barcelona
The calendar's dictatorship may fall on December 16th and 17th this year.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turón and the Christmas Lotteries, there are also groups of guests and leisure companies in Barcelona. However, due to the economic crisis, they solve a price-frequency segment that represents the great mass: almost all wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a dinner or dinner, confirm the entrepreneurs and associations concerned.
In order to make the booking even a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has fallen on the week of December 13, with the result of a wine of reservations of evenings on two special days (of 16 and 17) and almost no orders on the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up group appropriations for budgetary reasons.
In order not to forget this tradition, many employees pay these out of their own pockets.
As the conjunctture is always required, low prices are required, confirmed by the president of the staff of Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the roofing band is not ready to predict how the holidays will be seen in this month.
"The people pass it 'till time before they book it."
"They want to go out, but they focus on the prices," he stressed.
The business will go where it is good to "supply the quality of good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls us to remember that customers will save in times of crisis, so prices will be questioned at the highest price of 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it is clear that the offerer will lead to collapsing on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group says that the requests for this Friday would be made with a view to spending less than 30 euros. The group has adjusted its menu with complete offers of €25 to €35 on the conjunctural site.
In another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), has led the property of the calendar to be reserved from the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
In the AN group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 locals, optimism is not lost, since the second quarter, the revenue is rescinded and good, even if there are few days focused views on Christmas business.
The company's sources suggest that the 18th day will also be an active day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
In the six group menu, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than a price. It has been shown that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies it is also seen to speak of green issues, why employees are invited back. This implies that the groups are again in the wake.
Vacancy of the Facasarm roof (with connections such as the Barcelona knife, restaurant and leisure connection), the deputy president, Enric Gomà, hoped to see the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservations are "lived", although the customers "result up a maximum".
However, the party has not returned, regardless of who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is a major concern in the United States
Islamabad puts nuclear weapons "faster than any other country here."
Interpolations of Wikileaks confirm the relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American mission in Pakistan and the US State Department, which is also confirmed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the basis of the clear and clear details that provide documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, this implies that cooperation between the two countries in matters is not strengthened as a matter of absolute security, but rather "takes away", and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomized weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not combined, but that their individual parts are stored to make their destruction difficult when an attack is possible - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the messenger in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear plants to the Taliban area, the possible spread of nuclear material and the occurrence of transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and rocket programmes is no longer considered to be the United States, but also Russia as an outsider and as a reason.
"Pakistan needs to set strong faith-building personnel to monitor the nuclear installations; thanks to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to engage in nuclear or rocket programmes," said expert Yuri Korelov of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New documentation from Julian Assanges Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in matters of nuclear proliferation and the increased time in Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" states: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers or they will be rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the state secret service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster of Pakistan Atoms, no other country has produced as quickly as possible."
Ambassador Patterson invites Washington during a visit by the top leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, the responsible "to clarify", that "Pakistan Army has set up its infamous support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt to Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new complications.
Interpol provides a red warning of persecution and detection of Assange.
All that is associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complex labyrinth in which the facts are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "rote warning" for "recovery and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement to be adopted.
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia has to put itself in Sweden.
In addition, the attorney of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the International Police Authority, sitting in Lyon (France), at the request of Sweden, issued the order, but it was not known until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received power.
The 188 Interpol countries are directed to identify and find assange, "to establish and deliver it temporarily."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the organisation's statement that the red warning is free for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England where Assange is likely to be held.
The case was filed by Assanges lawyers who published a letter informing them that Wikileak's 39-year-old founder is ready to answer the questions of Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange was invited out of Sweden and was compared with the state-owned Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief security officer of Stalin, who received the appropriate approval.
"It's like a hunt, not a legal persecution," is charged in writing.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia, because of the guilt of her son - keeps Assange at an unknown place, yet not moving.
On Monday he gave the director of the magazine Time per Skype from an unknown location an interview. At the conversation, he called on the return of the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for organizing North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus have failed to sign an international agreement signed by the United States," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application "light and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the CNN sender.
Obama himself has a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documentation distortions.
The attempt by the speaker of President Barack Obama to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the views of conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The President of the Congress, Peter King, who has been taking the Chair of the National Security Committee of the House since January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to take over their money and anyone who supports or supports it."
Tom Flanagan, a counsellor of Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still gone, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama had to convert him into a target ship and an unmanned aircraft or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and perhaps presidential candidate.
"If it has always been the one who has provided information in the government, he is responsible for the transaction and everything that is not directed is a very peaceful punishment," he explained to the Ambassador Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eye switch to the carod nearby.
The Republican leader shall allow the Party to make a secret vote on its continuing stay at the office.
Huguet proposes a pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way, for the most part, of an internal explosion in the ranks of 11 members and half of the electoral votes.
The president of the party is aware that his withdrawal threat does not satisfy the neighbors of the former party leader Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor himself and will not protect him from the same headaches as other former flows.
The leader of Esquerra is therefore trying to win the new critics with an eyebrow, which would ensure his position up to the next municipal elections.
At first, it was announced that over 200 regional members of the ERC could be kept secret about their stay in the office.
With lists of options, not with raised hands.
If the Charoists wanted to pass a list of punishments to the presidents, they could do so without fear of repression.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of columning and that of subjugation under his own person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel half of the votes plus one who was not confirmed, and he added without stating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Card neighbors require more than the president to have his office available to the party. An insufficient guest, as Puigcercós controls the top organ of the Congress.
However, since they do not have sufficient majority to force returns, they will agree with the Board from now until May.
They expect to be able to influence the preparation of the strategic orientation document, which will be submitted to the Council on 18th.
Your intention is to serve Puigcercós. In contrast, this is to promise to present the Congress in autumn 2011, what the party will already have to do with a fact.
The Chair of the ERC is the view that "polyphony" is harmful to stability and he is trying to put the organization in place to wash their dirty wax behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, signed by the Amplifier Conseller Joseph Huguet in his blog, is sympathetic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideology, the holder of Innovacion held it to be supported by the party president "in exchange for different objectives".
He numbered five of them, two of whom are in the foreground.
Firstly, the "instruction" of the board, so that at least 90 per cent of the participants are involved in the involvement of new faces from Cardos Environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally set up the full set of principles as a function.
In this way, he advocates a reform of the status quos which will allow the congress to be held with the elected delegates.
From the completion of the full assembly model - an exception to the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team is already fighting for it at the last two conventions.
In fact, at the 2008 Biennial Meeting, the Party was responsible for reviewing the principle of full assembly at a conference to be held with the reform of the Statutes.
This term is still valid, since it was not reasonable to conclude this case in recent years.
Now, without the critical sectors at stake, the time could come to re-examine this matter and to conclude it forever.

In the San Francisco Aquautla settlement of Ixtpaluca, the lebossy body of a woman was found in the neck with arms of fire.
At the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa death and chains were discovered with appropriate images.
In the last half of the last month, in the town of Zinacantepec, the body of a man with at least three injections and a message signed by a criminal group was found in addition to a vehicle.
Two days later the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with cloth bands, were discovered in the village of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.

Besides him, the police found a father with a message.
China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon pollutants and would maintain its offer to build 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
During his first public appearance on the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei, his country, had made enormous efforts to replace carbon pollutants and to convert its industry.
He concluded that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in order to capture the emissions of greenhouse gases.
However, he explained that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community in this regard.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, which contains the objectives for the replacement of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the Federal States had worked with the Central State and the Communities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, the effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
In addition, he noted that some plans have already been taken or concluded for several years, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those received money from other countries.
For example, he was involved in the energy-efficient programme introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
It also runs a project on provincial level to climate change, a further exchange of traditional glaciers through energy savings and a further reduction and adjustment, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser to climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much more widely accepted than in common.
He pointed out that the pro-head emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while it was 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine-percent overall contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty-five percent over the last five years and is expected to take place by 2020, he said.
Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party president had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to ask what the right was to do to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN party president had the right to refer to the National Order Commission and to ask what the right was to do to him.
In an interview conducted before the complainant, Gabino Cué Monteagudos, the head of the federal government, explained that the conclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Commission de Orden del Council National in order to make a decision by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not to be remembered at the time of 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never been established in the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Akcion National was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, at which his successor is elected.
"This (a 2012 Alliance) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the Community election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "does not undermine internal competition; rather, "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt select the best president, or the best president, who would need the Action National for the next three years.
"I'm all worried and open there. I'd be proud to transfer one of the five to the office of the president of the party."
He predicted that the party's appearance recorded at the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012".
"Now it is going to support Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that formed alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the prisoners and observe them throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires will be put in them, and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI at President Philip Calderón for his speech in his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to think about the six-year period of the former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start protecting them, they should finally get out of trouble," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the Federal Government expressed such a view in his speech in the National Auditorio, because there is no oral ban in this country and a lower concentration.
Obama sits in Twitter for the law to benefit undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then your senators call and press on the adoption of this Act," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on the Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social Twitter network.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then your senators call and press on the adoption of this Act," Obama tweeted.
Its brief communication contains a cyberlink to a wider document which calls for the public to contact its senators, as the voting of the law is immediately ahead.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stressed.
The message was spread, after the 42 Republican senators had withdrawn, to block all voices for each law, except for the extension of tax arrangements from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the voting of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he was confident that if the tax issue was solved once, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"All of us agree that the tax matter must be developed before the year-end..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at any time and then we can plan the remainder," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "the vote would be requested at the conclusion of the debate" so that the Dream Act, with which the initiative to legislate undocumented students from the next Thursday in the Senate, would be more likely to be the next week.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American Dream, would legislate about 800 000 young people living in the United States when they were not yet sixty years old, living in this country for the last five years and registered in a higher education facility or in the army.
However, the legislators need to adopt the six votes on the initiative, because they are pointing to the votes of a full Republican. In the meantime, the organizations of the sponsors of this project have an intensive influence on the adoption of the Act.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have more than 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said that he would vote and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act must have several republicans on their side, if other Democrats should decide to take the initiative back.
The majority of the Republicans who have been expelled belong to Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they stated that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his stand.
Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act is in the Senate before the greatest obstacles.
With literature put the finger in the dogs
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a step in which participants made a strong effort to tell the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the gun? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la langua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish literature and used the title of her question at this time (on another occasion the round table was devoted to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the cave... "takes us into difficulties", the Argentine writer gave a sweet taste to the audience, which was composed mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to accommodate this moderate table of Marisol Shultz, at Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero, and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she referred to Gonzalo Celorio, and then identified the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "winde" and is going to a doctor who does not receive any response, but leads to the guidance of her story.
Infectologists leave her convinced: "patience is not my strength, maybe it's my miracle."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who threw her in the middle of the attack, and who explained that the ghost is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalytics include the secret: "The miracle is really the open, the symbolic is the madness."
The main figure of the story is easy, and it concludes that it “is only known by the miracle that it is really open and not exist”. But it is convinced that the fun of language and its events are changing.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also provided a fascinating story that he called 'the fun of finding', and in which the finger is not mentioned in the miracle, but is discovered.
He told stories about the magical reality of magic by a famous magician who touched the clouds, threw away the wounded men, or restored the tugens lost by a girl. The story made a return use and reported by America, the great Roman who did not at first miss it to his own crownists, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the influence of the stories told by the Europeans.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers) to meet the supposed witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with educational power that even caused the feeling of shame."
However, he goes on to say, "if there are the crazy and liars who best imagine things," and there is the reality and lies to each other, where one no longer knows which side of the story is on, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have called to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that contributed to the invitation of the film to the round table 'The Finger in the Wonder'.
The Cubans and Puerto Ricans devoted their contribution to the great virtues of social violence, which their country commands - as a whole Latin America - as a result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a steady, unplanned commitment," she explained, after she had highlighted that literature is communication and binding that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
On the evening of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, his contribution also "the finger of the engaged writer in the well-being of the writer" was highlighted.
He noted that in a fast-lived world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness are also passed on to dogmas, and he forgets that "that behind every confirmation there is a small no and a small yes."
"To have our thoughts and to be reality, we must be curious: And to announce it often means to put the fingers in the jaws and to put those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, black and white, in pre-existing ideas without novelty, and also to persuade the authorities who prefer to share the world in black and white, he noticed and laughs to repeat the meaning of the writing.
Romano fought for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three downloads in final games, he experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles of their respective trains stand against each other, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three downloads in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has three times had decisive games, and he has kept himself well, why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has raised himself with the medal to the second champion, he is a step behind the winners, and he has miraculously issued the following finals with the same team.
The Scientist street reached the first game as a trainer at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', as part of Morelia had the train in hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive doll, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to hide again because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went uninterrupted after 210 minutes, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and managed to sign his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the devil Rojos and one with Monterey, his great rival. Therefore, he did not want to be persecuted again from the accident and free himself from the evil magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirmed that the game was the most important for him.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, it's for a club, for my attachment to me, and that's why the title will come to me, but what's going on before is the most important," said the tax man when he was asked about the lost finals.
The last final game is still strong in his mind, he's sure to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from is that until the judge doesn't finish the game, we can't celebrate, we're ready on the line, because the players too, because the last time we were already prepared for it, we were with two eleven meters, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is over, there's no way to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be selected by elfmeter chips, he does not encourage him because he trusts his players: "I never want to get to the elfmeter boots, you want to finish in the regular game, but sometimes there is no alternative and you need to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the previous tournament, but unfortunately the transmission hall prepared a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the strong desire to keep the title in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time will not be there."
It is in Romanso Power, not only to be a second champion, but to spend the first time with the title.
The United States changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their conversation in the Consulate at the service stations for visa applications; costs will be reduced in the meantime.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States' message and in the consulates shall be amended.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their conversation in the Consulate at the service stations for visa applications (ASC, the original letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall take into account the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be checked by the consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants to count:
The total costs for the revision of the visa are reduced, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the terminal language, the processing of the visa application and the transport service to which the document is issued.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for Visa with an application (including Visa for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa must not engage in conversation in the consulate, they must only present themselves at the next ASC where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are stored in the ASC, the applicant who needs a second term for the conversation in the consulate remains there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the 26-dollar service fee.

NASA announces the fund of foreign life
The North American Space Agency introduced a press conference to propose a fund tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for life in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States is present tomorrow, Thursday, with an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA in Washington, D.C., by experts of astronomy. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the launch of the press conference, NASA assured that it will represent "a visible fund for the search for foreign life", which will solve speculations in experts from other countries.
The discovery could reveal that it can exist in hostile environments that have been held to be unaccompanied by human creations. The hypothesis was raised that they could transform themselves into intelligent beings - such as humans - if they improved their living conditions.
It seems that it is a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in Yosemi National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that has been kept too toxic for all thinking life forms, since the sea is highly arsenic.
In any way, the microbe uses the medicine as a resource for survival. Taking into account this ability, the chances that it could give similar life on other planets that do not have our protected atmospheres.
When these organisms change the drugs, it is shown by astronomers that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from what we know of."
At the press conference tomorrow, the space travel agency will be aware of the real wealth of its funds.
At the conference, geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on March, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon Saturn) under the question of whether his chemical composition resembles the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the agenda for the Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they will regret it.
The 60th legislative period had begun, and an opposition block had already been installed, introduced by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who represented themselves as independent. The following four questions were raised: the introduction of the 'Two-Party System' in the Chamber.
Prior to the introduction into the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the system of origin, as they were excluded from it.
With this reform, they continued to introduce a 'double-party system' because now there would be two persons, the same number as the parties that controlled the Congress.
These four members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PPD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the presidency of the Holy See of Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in its capacity as vice-presidents.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political orientation with these reforms.
He pointed out that they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI in the next days to change the scheme. They went out of their political will and, if they had not, they would be informed again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I (the opposition coalition) is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patron and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the legislative reform that a permanent two-part system should prevail in Congress."
"For the first time, this group starts with five members and they speak with other colleagues and colleagues in order to make it more," said the Convergencia Member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT played on PAN and PRI that the convention was now transformed into a 'beauti' for two.
"Before, there was only one party, now they share these two together."
Patrón Montalvo called for respect for the members and assigned them their place in the negotiations.
"It is not possible to be left out because of five excellent decisions which are likely to be nine Members. The five who are currently seen as split into different groups have decided to agree to enter our place of negotiation, because because of the reform carried out by the others, we have remained outside and we do not understand this reform."
200,000 peso more for "the suppliers"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays a further check on the company's mixed owner for electromaterials.
A further check on some more than 200,000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This represents the sum paid to the owner of the company for electricity in the second half of the year, 1,200 000 pesos.
According to the website for the more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on a sum of 200,144,56 peso issued on the last 16 November, with the use of the "Calculation of Open Accounts".
Mr. Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money from the community would go to these suppliers. She will be watched by the Auditia Superior del Estado because she sells too much prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that you still owe and therefore the number of checks that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought at her, it's just going to pay the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last check "birth" in the last quarter of the year "again": 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November last.
Although the suppliers have not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when an ASE company is asked to avoid requests by other administrations for their services, the Court of Auditors assured that their services would not be re-appropriated.
After the Noroeste newspaper was published on 25 July, the city administration's audit of the Schekks issued to its suppliers was announced that it had already paid the community over 10 million people from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
There were also trades with Jumapam where they took over 3 million peso pieces in value.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies suspect the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the storm of a foreign tourist into the entrance of Gloriata Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán called on the authorities to give special attention to the areas that are in a bad condition and to cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the trade union of Zone Dorada, recalled that it was called for different opportunities to pursue the travel goal and to transform the bad conditions of tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of roads and bridges had been negatively affected by the fact that tourists came to the threshold and saw the regulation, while they would use the nearby countries to return.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you've lost, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work this way slowly and unplanned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's noise had focused on the lack of prevention and maintenance work outside the city.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid that something is going on again. How will it do that? Well, by preventive maintenance, it will improve everything in the vicinity," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city, because not only because it is a foreign transport area, they must be maintained, but we also have a right to a clean living room. The city administration must change its strategy to get the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that are also improbable and unsound," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and the tourist attractions always in check," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of events are the only thing that is obvious to all: a maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not use properly and let a bad picture emerge.
He mentioned a number of places that were to be brought to the city along with the predecessor. The city should be organized clean, orderly and attractive for the transport of foreigners.
"Mazatlán, unfortunately, offers many historical and cultural places that have to be restored and cleaned for the first time in order to make them attractive to the foreign transport and to bring them to the inventory we buy for this purpose.
IP required results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that the rapporteurs should take the lead in setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlán calls for a strong Parliament, free of discussion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is angry and faces great problems.
Last night, the 60th Parliament was elected. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 prime ministers, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PPDs, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEMs.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, feel obliged to the society and different social groups, which are assigned to a responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of participation and patriotism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new members should take the lead in giving a better signaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the honourable Members will really exercise their right to conduct free talks between the parties, because it is normal that they meet agreements with which they represent their own interests, in which they become partners in Carnevals of the Government and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to build the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they perform a trustworthy work and put their trust in the society and their groups, for they were the people of Sinaloa who spoke to them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 peoples is the drive and joint work for the state's economic growth, as today the economic crisis is extremely complex.
"The most important thing is that they pursue economic growth, create investment approaches and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation."
In view of the foreign transport sector, he asked the new Members to share the required position in the state budget in order to promote the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"I understand that it is the ministry with the least secondary means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings dividends and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agricultural industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated money, state security must be supported, and alcohol law, which has not been re-established in previous legislative periods, must be introduced to the latest stage.
The Holy King Is Searched for
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want to see themselves.
For parents, it will be difficult on the next three days to satisfy these desires, as the budget is no longer set up and not less than twelve persons and a pair of shoes.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they look like.
The family lives a certain house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times have been said because my husband has no job. But we sell Mandarins and Cartofeln... I'm going to go with the kids on the street the next day," said Kayeta Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a pump or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a Barbie pump.
The 10-year-old José Alfredo wants a 'monster car' for a while, and for this eight-month old brother Jesus presents Cayetana clothes in the size of a year.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I wish this monster', but I answered him, 'Wait for us, young' because it was very expensive," Kayeta said sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the tenth-year Isaiah has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King will be sought' by spending a toy or bar money in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 Mustamatic Drug Abusers
On Wednesday, in the context of the completion of a Cannabis production and sales network, ten household surveys were conducted in the Administrative Region of Estonia.
Forty persons were arrested and various charges were filed against them.
The household surveys were performed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, at the locations where the drug production was mainly used.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four Kilo Haschisch, bar money and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of Quebec's security police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, from which two of the men, who were considered chief drug dealers, came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have appeared within hours of their arrest before the court building in Sherbrooke.
They could be charged, inter alia, with the charge of the production of Cannabis, their possession for sale, the whole and the service of crimes.
These household surveys had resulted in a long-term investigation that lasted more than a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Mr. Ruel pointed out.
About 70 police officers from the regional intelligence unit Estonia of the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police and the Memphremagog police authorities had participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be easily followed
The Bill of Conservatives, which the Government calls on the Government to address the problem of ships loaded with domestic migrants, will be seized in advance after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not comply with the proposal.
"I'm going against this map with pressure."
"I'm with a party that has put your feet on your feet," explained Michael Ignatiff, chief of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucas meeting before the members gathered.
The liberals, who claimed that the bill, which allows to retain any person who came from a ship identified as the transport of illegal immigrants, would suffer as proposed by the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Block Québecois, also pointed out that he could not support the bill because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government takes," said Mr. Ducepe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration question, NDP, has shown the critics by hand who demand that their party do not feel strongly about the domestic immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats are agreed to take action against the blind passengers, and we are also trying to implement this by means of another legislation, the C-35," Chow said.
We did not endorse the constitutional constitution of the conservatives because he was looking for the blame for refugees and kept children in custody for at least a year," said Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney charged opposition parties to play with politics and ignore the wishes of the Canadians.
"The Canadians are telling the honourable Members that they do not tolerate this kind of domestic immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treat the country as a subsidiary."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys' reaction.
"The Government has not announced any confidence in its legislation that could have led the country to elections which the government had rejected.
A conservative, however, pointed out against the QMI agency that the government would adopt a vote to make it clear immediately to its voters.
The new unit does not find any consistency
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, existing unit for combating corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to require the formation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, argues that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject in January last.
The Metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure has not been discussed at least in spite of the presence of Robert Dutils in the last year, despite the fact that the Committee of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police was held on 29 October.
There was also a lack of understanding that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québecois Party, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "out of the heat-contained rabbits" and "in a legally based solution".
On the other hand, Minister Dutil was referring to those who feared that the political power had too much influence on the question, a future unit.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he said.
"Man is aware of this problem."
According to Rejean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charrest needs to stop this investigation committee's education, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to form an investigation committee is the return of Jean Charest," stated Yves Boisvert, a lecturer for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State School for Higher Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this bag, he suggested to Quebec that the financial audit should be carried out by a special mandate so that it can set up appropriate research on corruption and secret talks.
"I should be able to extend the mandate of the inspection," he decided.
He also expressed the view that Quebec's inspection control could occupy the same power as Commissioners, which would allow you to force the people to make a statement.
The formation of an existing unit is not the only project in the government's college.
The Quebec will also be asked by Ottawa to amend the criminal law accordingly in order to be better placed on this kind of crime.
This claim is made by the Supreme Court of the Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the legal proceedings in this case are not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed on his behalf, his colleague of Justice Rob Nicholson, is currently faced with certain innovations concerning this file.
During the operation of Princemps 2001, which affected groups of motor traffic police, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law was not renewed.
That is why Ottawa has implemented the law against Gangstertum.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river flows remain under stricter surveillance because of the high rainfall that has taken place in some regions of the province since the service day.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, there was a earthquake on Wednesday.
Two houses were practically evacuated.
On the evening, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Administrative Region of Lanaudiere.
A road is set up in this direction.
Between 40 and 70 millilitres of the Netherlands have been hosted by severe rainfalls in several regions from Tuesday to Wednesday.
Between 20 and 40 other millimetres of the Netherlands were expected to reach the regions until Donnerstagbend.
The northern regions of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouai region were most affected.
There were up to 100 millimetres of rainwater down here.
As the snowflakes that have already been collected in certain parts of the world are still to be added to these subspecies, the transfer of several waterways is feared.
At midweek, the Quebec Security Service issued a warning of the high-waste alert concerning the river Oureau and Achigan in the Lanaudier region.
The river flows north, Saint-Jérôme, the Laurentian Mountains and the Chechens in Lotbinière will continue to be monitored and maintained.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy snowfalls have taken over some lakes in Sainte-Juliane, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an outbreak was continued due to severe rainfalls.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as preventive measures.
In Otaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the Mansfield-et-pontfract.
The security service continues to remain in alertness and monitors the situation accurately, such as the security department Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Country Water Centre, on the other hand, has issued a warning signal for the strong flow of several rivers, in particular machinenongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Double-declining depreciation [d]
The Quebecer Runfunk Moderator Stéphane Dupont has experienced a partial rejection before the Canadian Board for Round Functional Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial objections about social care and Haitians as well as his frequent talk about funk.
The CCNR shares the opinion, Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team, although it had the right to express its opinion, but had certain explanations "not only information on the social care and improper negative representations of the Haitians, but also an unwelcome discussion which is not appropriate for the daily broadcasts."
The Board of Supervisors has also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide against the code of conduct of the movement.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the submissions issued in 2008 and 2010.
The first available was lodged on the basis of a complaint from the "Common Front of the People's Social Assistance du Québec".
The most active organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inadequate.
The moderators should be more solid than unsolicited messages.
With regard to the theme of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide was an expression of weakness.
The majority of the supervisory board members had taken the conclusion that the message delivered was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Board of Supervisors has taken into account that the implications of the "Dupont le Midi" have been linked to a sensitive subject in a legitimate and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was treated with no tadel against his own person.
The last point concerns the statements regarding the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a medium-acting argument that there were many reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not paid for the help of Haiti, since he did not know with certainty whether the needy would also receive the money.
The Board of Supervisors is of the opinion that these comments have not been misleading characters, but that their cumulative effect is an improper negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already suffered my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My act has been young for over a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisors shall facilitate the dissemination of an unsolicited expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM round-fashioner has acted "on the contrary of his obligations".
The consequences of the round-off operators, including those whose decisions are to be notified within a period of three days, shall be minimal.
A King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacerdine Zemmal, a Montreal Algerian origin, has introduced a very special course.
The Athlet, which shines in "Sanda" (Volktakt King-Fu), in the Kickboxes as well as in the Thaiboxes, is now looking for new challenges to Tatami and the Boxings of the World.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as King-Fu and kickboxes," said Zemmel, who has been in the Metropolis since 2008.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who present the fight on the ground, such as the mixed war won't like fighting in North America, it's rare."
Recently, his character as a security officer, as well as his rivals at the UPS company, gave him bad news, in which he held two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA), issued between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won the victory in the completely contact categories of Kickboxes and Thaiboxes," he explained.
"Now I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"These fighters were invited out of each category, who were placed in the first four of the last world empires."
"I was born in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I've become a successor in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China on the fifth place, while I became in Toronto IIIter in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in each fight."
"With this rhythm, I will be the first one this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are emerging disciplines from China, where foot-and-mouths and foot-and-mouths are allowed as well as ground-winter.
The two games usually play on a platform, rare in a boxing.
The most famous box fighter, which has been made of this kind of combat sport, is the American Vietnamese-born Cung Le, who is well known in the world of fighting art.
If Nacer Zemmal were to keep only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tourner "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This battle is the highest and most seen in China," explained the sympathic psudsker.
"It's a little like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
He won his first fight in the semifinal of his category (80kg) before he lost it in the final.
"The one who saw me was a real profi," he analyzed.
"There are four Mitstreitters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the stars to celebrate a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in treaties without a declaration
Hydro-Québec has, on the other hand, approved 450 million dollars of contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-rupter project.
Among these, more than 100 contracts are a Consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor companies, which received the most important share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without a statement.
This Consortium, called "Energy geirance", was formed in 2004 as a co-decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector in charge of this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the "Energy Gerance" Consortium set up the lucrative contract without giving a public statement.
For the Québécois party, the withdrawal of a serious ethical problem is a serious issue that poses the risk of distortion of competition as well as a price increase.
"This is a new way of a carded game and boosts competition."
"This means that rather than carded games are done in a secret way and now in open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ's deputy secretary at the press conference yesterday.
On the morning of the morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems difficult for him to understand how public interest can be expressed in this way and in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalia Normandeau had reacted to this on the afternoon by saying that it had been dealt with as an abstract game in Abred.
"I remain faithful to my line," she replied, confirming that the PQ has been "misleading" and it's "misleading you."
She said it was "be the least" that the PQ was guilty.
The model of the Consortium is a worldwide practice.
It is usually a time-consuming association that allows two or more companies to grant their experts an offer to an explanation for a complex project.
The "Estmain" project shows a high degree of complexity with regard to its work scale.
The construction process is under way and will be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the possibility of a competition dispute; it had already given negotiations.
In addition, the model of the Consortium in Quebec does not appear to be an exception even in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devor" last week noted, the model of the Consortium of government funding was used in the area of engineering and consulting.
A short flight from the Quebecer Business Register allows more than 200 concerts, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, the Dessau company works in partnership with most of its core competitors, which count as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsul.
There are several thousands of connections, leading to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the "Energy girance" Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special dynamic of work and that hydro-Québec should take account of this fact in a special way since the 70s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d'Energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nassa had broken down on the fact that the contract on project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make a statement and there are only a few bidders, your prices will be speeded up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this March and tell you: you will be able to negotiate a pleasant convention at a good price."
"The idea is, however, not that the price is decisive, but the person's understanding," confirmed the report.
This agreement approved by the "Energy girance" Consortium is part of a long list of contracts over 50,000 dollars received by the Québecois Party.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-rupert project.
After a review, the newspaper "Le Devor" reported more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, companies or branches, including in particular resource labs, were made available between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had reached 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Energy guerance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled $449,783,344, including the contract with "Energy girance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had left that the four companies that formed the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of the "Part of Liberal du Québec probably knew".
Minister Normandeau had called on the PQ to be equally linked to the companies that "funded", before she pointed out that it was much more about their leadership.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not reliable
Greener, but unbelievably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main factors of sustainable growth, but also less for the marked brands or eco-labels that should control its choice.
Unfortunately, although it is in a medium-acting universe, where it is only as exciting as information in favour of a responsible consumer: the barometer has a lack of credible information, a delay that makes itself known as the brake of its commitments, as the first reading showed that it was delayed yesterday.
Although they have promoted the consumption of the so-called socially contractual products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to be less crediting those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population are expected to give the company’s environmental commitment as little faith as the Green Company’s bid, thus providing the relevant user centre of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding is that half of the consumers doubles the reliability of the official, partially safe products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that are declared to be known as the environment, the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discussion of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
The information on responsible consumption seems equally important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently only a third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and double character of the information affected 46% of consumers.
This is after the highest price of the products the second bridge identified by the barometer.
In addition, a third of the Quebecers of the said performance of the green products and services that they are trying to put into their hands are suspicious of them.
According to another communication, over half of the consumers in 2010 had changed their habits and changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometers, they also preferred 61% of purchases for dealers of their city area and enjoyed the purchase of food built in their region.
Greens and responsible experts - the index of the known environmental consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as a king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, the social and ecological awareness seems to remain ahead of his car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that public transport resources were used in 2010 or preferred the transport centres to demonstrate their ecological interest.
In addition, the increase and the road traffic were also affected by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural question, which feeds on the clicks.
State aid for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the parallele company to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The development company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had made up an amount of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over Daniel Langlois's kinocomplexe eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, had hoped to respond to this back to its actual Chinese function, did not clearly receive what they requested.
The Government has agreed to involve itself in this matter, however, in its own circumstances.
Instead of the expected contributions, the Quebec government offers less loans than the expected initially expected height that could call for a viable solution to the conditions of life, at least in the opinion of the sources taken from the State source.
A first action plan and a request after 12.8 million had already been withdrawn from Quebec last morning, the request has been corrected in summary form since the re-examination.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the "Société de dévelopement des enterprisees culturalles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is leading the eXcentris act.
A few days ago, he had given her a final report.
However, the Board's opposition proposal was forwarded to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallelle and Angus now have until December 31st, the time to respond to this.
In any case, the state funds premiums seem to be actually printed on the side.
We call to mind that the Quebecer owning community of cinemas and cinema complexes had invested themselves with a direct State investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by offering the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he had not allowed to come to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment called for substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years, Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the authorene in the spaces of his cinema complex, which could justify the exclusion from the state tax.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his client at the station.
The Société Angus as well as the company parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top, on the other hand, are paying a private funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to rent the project.
Since the spring of 2009, only one liinwand has gone on to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The objective of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinemas next year on 27 February with the launch of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "The Hommes et deux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not completed the newspaper "Le Devor" and you have ignored what he and his group have kept from the proposals that have been made to them.
Secret of the complex protected Canada
The new American diplomats, which were spread by WikiLeaks, shed light on what the United Nations felt under the Canadian minority complex against the Americans, but they also opened up the feeling of superiority against Canada as a whole.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electoral election does not mean Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American mission in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicized yesterday, provide even more detailed details than the mere substantive content to which you have to draw.
A data link, dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full place, tells of the extent to which the United Nations no longer participates in the implementations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, an American messenger employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"One of the Canadians who live close to the local minority complex may require the Canadian political leadership to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than the United States to send the black Peter (such as in 1988 on the free trade campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, are therefore "the oral Goliath of this election: unnipresented but potentially dangerous to speak of him".
The messenger understands this "extraordinary style" much less, since both countries are deeply involved in political and economic relations.
"Logistically," he estimates, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the elector has in mind at the beginning of the day as a key actor."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is the communication sent by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009 to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure that the Government continues to hold trust in the Federal Budget in early February, when Canada's first deficit is announced after more than a decade, which has been created by a programme of consumption of between $30 and $40 billion," says Breese.
In any event, he mentioned that the government had to have refused the Parliament's sitting before Christmas to prevent Parliament from being controlled by the coalition and would affect the continued presence of the opposition parties to the quality of the proposed entertainment programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, dating and by Ambassador Wilkins, explains Washington from the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series distributed over CBC are spread by the United States.
The messenger is inspired by such messages as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle performances on Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or even exercises for the purpose of muscle parts of the CIA.
Again, a further communication is detailed about how Hillary Clinten, in her French colleague Bernard Kouchner, then asked whether Europe was ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "fall to Case" decision.
But at the end of the meeting, he described it as "the Secretary of State has issued a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim from the beginning."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the act again."
Finally, we note that the poets are building on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flaangan, an old and Stephen Harper very well-known consultant, had explained over the CBC that those responsible for this massive Leck should be "responsible".
He was referring here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
In Cancún yesterday, UNO proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position as part of the concrete major projects aimed at implementing the UN in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of binding reduction obligations in the countries of industry.
Following yesterday's plan, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of FCKW produced on the ground, if the white-lighted children, who had previously represented a 50 to 70% monopole on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better, light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the greenhouse gas in the world.
In Copenhagen last year, large gas carriers, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce the global FCKW emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance it was necessary to remove 5 gt to stabilize the climate level from today to 2020 by 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this out of control.
In the white-lighting islands, 95% of energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
With the compact lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED lamps, this energy demand is again reduced twice.
The compact lamps hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips brought this week to the market - this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-lighted beer, which will provide an increase in the potential of the exchange plan to be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that ice completely new raindrops only give very little heat, they can also function with a regular resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact lamps contain reserves, as they contain mercury and that they need to be provided as a special powder, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers to provide an admission.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, is the report, not the compact light bulbs, but much more the coal-powered power plants that release significantly more mercury to generate electricity used by the white-lighted babies.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants cost 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report describes the benefits that each country would have with this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which would mean an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
The cost of electricity is expected to be announced by the selection results
UNO Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the results of the presidential election of the elephant coast directly after their release.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to get its work done and to make known its preliminary results without further delay," said a UN Chief Press speaker.
"It calls upon all parties and institutions of the Effbenkus to demonstrate their responsibility and to include each initiative to deliver the preliminary results."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had the deathline established on Wednesday night, three days after the election on Sunday, without the publication of the results.
About four minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on the television that the Commission would "keep working" to deliver the results.
In the middle of the week there have been many calls from around the world, but the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the distinguished Laurent Gbagbo and its opposition Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo-Lager calculates the cancellation of the "rebellious" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was obtained by the ex-rebellious newer of the Force (FN) during the failed Putsche in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the elephant coast, had confirmed that the manoeuvres practiced by the United Nations to attract voters in the north of the country had forced the president's candidates to go to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contractors are now more of the view that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a political link to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who cut off any connection to the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in announcing the results of the elections as "unresponsible" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them even if he has not gone so far to ask for victory.
His associates confirmed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew he had lost; and that a complaint was filed before the Constitutional Court after the election of the Commission was prevented from publishing the results, very illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were held for the purpose of completing a country's union and reconciliation process, which had been split into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the politicians of the elephant coasters that they could be held responsible for this in the event of any delays.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattar, who welcomed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% in the metropolis of the International Labour Agency (IAA) in the meaning of the International Labour Agency (IAA) (including the Overseas Departments at 9.7%), thus showing the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Statistical Institute of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the Metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures of the second quarter are 9.3% of the eligible population in the Metropolis and 9.7% of the departments in Overseas.
Over the year the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter of the French Metropolis was not employed by 3.4 million employees, however, wanted to find a job; it was related to whether they were now available for all two weeks or not or whether they were working or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has increased by 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the area of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed.
The elderly, on the other hand, have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (see +0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the Metropolis (-0.1% over three months, +0.1% over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a review of its calculation procedure, the Statistical Office of the Federation of Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to perform this method and announced a 9.8% rate on Tuesday in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of an insurance company and brother of the President of the Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was placed in prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation procedure on the public and suspected fraud markets in Lyons.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with the destruction of social resources, the destruction of public property, helms, fraud in corruption, illegal possession and possession of weapons, as his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight, and is prepared to address all the issues raised by the government, rather than spread the coins."
"It is easy for him to submit a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Raul of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his mandate.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (part of the socialist) in the department, had the right to allow the judge before hearing him, through his lawyer, to obtain a memorandum of understanding.
Philippe Rapezzi, an official of Guérinis, was also charged and arrested at the middle school.
According to the lawyer Lucien Simon, her husband had never done anything but his deposition that he had to lead to keep running.
With regard to the business competence area or the purpose of the fund associated with it, he had never known, as Simon did.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Balling Room, was charged on Wednesday because of humiliation and complexity, but then, under the order, to remain under the legal supervision of the protagonists of this act, again standing on a free foot.
"My mandant could provide explanations of the facts he was charged with."
"The leading government lawyer has taken into account that he is not deprived of his freedom, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other persons were charged and were released from the port on Wednesday night of Tuesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, so did the deputy superstate attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), will be prosecuted due to "unauthorized influence and passive improvement".
Two state officials of the Balling Room Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, one because of the title "Intervention and verification of public service by a public service agent", the other because of "competitiveness in the acquisition of public funds".
The life-threatening of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "heerie and defeat of society".
For the people who were opposed to Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard is recently arrested because of a similar case of public fraud involving Corsica.
The driver suspects his company to contribute to the removal of money from "high" criminal circles.
In April 2009, the investigation against X due to significant amounts in the award of public contracts, particularly in the field of disposal, will be conducted in detail by anonymous letters in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of detection indicate that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the accession and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, as well as on waste from the Aubagne region, as well as from certain cities of the urban area of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Travel: the Elysée Palace exceeds its central function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "Spionage", the French public in Atem, replaced the diplomacy in alarming and stressed the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all in the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents from WikiLeaks and the newspaper "Le Monde" provide some background reasons for this crisis.
They described how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far to give these recommendations to deal with their own crisis of "taken" in Iran (a small group of wanderers).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of young French people is not the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and the American justice for dealing with material in favour of Iran's Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set out the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making these ideas believed by the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 includes the title "Iran: French comments on the nature and way of dealing with gambling".
François Richier, Elysée-Berator in Strategic Questions, attended with Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegone.
They explained the French method.
They urge the Americans to put everything in order to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
They said, "Artistically and clearly and without permission" the words "Generic human rights", "Unfortunately release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into existence, which is very sensitive to its image.
"This is so much more than the Iranians ask you not to do."
Because "Styllswheit doesn't solve anything", the discussion tests are going on an unprecedented way, the Iranians are "masters in exchangemen".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "prolonged, Iranian tactic": "receiving for the purpose of political repression".
He announced that Clotilde's release from prison (which should come on August 16th, on the day when she fled to the French mission) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros).
And he lets it happen that the elysée is more anticipative, a phenomenon that "will be shaken."
The Iranians could "in the near future another of some 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison twelve days ago, but remains in Iran.
An information was provided in progress: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronic material in Iran, was dismissed after the decision of a director in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American message raises questions about this disturbing conicidity.
For Washington, following the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of nuclear material, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France take a cookie trade in the purchase?
The release of Iran from those of France?
On September 4th, a renewed training with Kathleen Allegorne assures François Richier that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "extremely surprised by the decision of the director", but also tried to retaliate against it.
"It has given a great deal of exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the right decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strong" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée-Berator selects a phone number, puts it back on, informs the American diplomat, who is currently in Paris "in the buildings led by the Iranian message".
While the safety of Clotilde Reiss in Iran does not prevent Elysée from putting his efforts to believe in the "flight tests" by means of the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential middleroll".
The Americans did not observe this activity without irony and found that the manipulation produces fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from 25 August 2009 calls out "the media coverage of the French authorities".
On the basis of so many "thanks" against Mr Assad, the Paris message is asked.
"In spite of their declarations of praise, the French authorities are secretly saying that they have only a clear understanding of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document thus deals with the reasons that the Elysée has brought to pass this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up against Syria", he analyzes.
A 2008 policy was launched, which was adopted at the time "by many critical votes in France and abroad as a slow and unappreciative one".
"The Syrian role building" tries Paris "to lead Syria in the face of what can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "be a contribution between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On 11 August François Richier entrusted her: "Of course we don't know whether the Syrians have done what they have always done."
"But we thanked them for everything."
"This should at least create confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our people".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschen frädel", which prohibits young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, so stated government officials.
A bill to require online players to refuse access to these games by young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be submitted to Parliament in December, representing representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and thus have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life every day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, with this bill dealing with the French press agency Agency France Presse, explained.
The online games will then be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies had a long time to prepare themselves for the application of the law, so he specified.
The government also takes note of the request by the manufacturers to withdraw the time spent every day for accessing these games from the young people whose parents ask them to do so, adding the responsible ones.
It will also provide those who wish to make free programs that allow them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also an infamous champion in online game competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea had achieved four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Mastership 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the Country of Directors
In the wake of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the world's top political elections 2018 and 2022, in which the ranges of influence and lobbying will push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the issue of 2018 will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, the Netherlands).
The edition of 2022 will then become something more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) in 2010 after the prize on the African continent, or to continue its landing in the United States or in Fernot (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch government chief, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of economic and political use of a world empire.
So the companies behind the cults are trying to keep up to the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents offer better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which, with the suspension of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the funerals, would also have been well able to destroy the chances for her own country, along with the football, which only once held the world empire out of existence, namely 1966.
The BBC had re-submitted to the Commission on Monday by issuing a documentary report, which was adopted by three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There is enough reason to despise the FIFA and bring in the English officials who, in the first line with David Cameron, had an intense lobbying in these last few weeks.
The Head of Government hopes for a new flag of the prize won by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to reassess the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spanish Portuguese is not lacking in drums with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial consequences of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English and the doubts about Solvenz Spain and Portugal give rise to the chances of Russia, which, despite its shortcomings in the folder (Studien, Hotels, Transport), has become important outsiders.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to address the inconsistencies of the English press "an incomplete competition in the preparation of the vote" by the Committee members.
"Man persuades her with pressure, tries to compromise her," Putin said.
For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical interests.
The first economic power, the seat of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates appear to be a surprise to two countries that had organized the fight with the year 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the WM 2026 for China by the FIFA, which allows Asian opportunities to be suspended by 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had taken all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stadiums, the FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because they are certain.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (in view of the time difference) that is sensitive to FIFA's nerves.
Second Mandate: Openness
The Gaulle was really tired.
In the meantime, he had thought he'd be in a hurry.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the smallest birds.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than that.
A mission in Elysée calls the next one.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But openness is not good to the side of the mystery, which assumes the role of the Presidency.
So you have to do as much as you can if the doubt continues to grow.
In one way or another.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third mandate should not be excluded without believing in it themselves.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure to meet his decision "in the spring of 2011".
The fact that he would allow the prospect of "two Mandates" to be reached on the day of service in Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians would then have increased a bit of complacency.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
We're in the wrong place.
The President merely recalled that the amendment of the 2008 Constitution limited the number of five-year official periods to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he mentions the presidential election of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You've been with me for seven or seven years, or better," he explained to them in July 2009.
In a new May 2010: "I don't believe I don't think about the phase then."
His words of predecessors no longer make him a candidate than before; neither do they.
If they should make comments, then for a double reason.
Acceleration of the wind speed around the candidate with the PS on one side.
But it is not the competition with Ségoléne Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy strives to manifest himself.
On the contrary, it is its public candidate in 2012, which many members of the PS mentioned earlier as admitted to the fight case.
Bad questions on the other side.
For the first time, the right-holders would present a candidate from François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it," responded immediately and cautiously the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he could find a download as possible, he wouldn't have been invited," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can see," says Alain Juppé, who discovered himself with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of state paper
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Bank in the past year should provide an opportunity to show how you came out of the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of non-conventional measures of monetary policy, which should be concluded by the end of the year.
The crisis of European State debt requires that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can't afford any doubt, even today, to cause more than the alarming situation on the European loan markets to prevent them from renegotiating.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had recently welcomed a press conference which the ECB adopted as an active role in solving Europe's debt debt.
It did not expect to say whether it was the view that the central bank could do more, for example by refurbishing its procurement programme.
"I have kept my views on my European trading partners before (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels, on the morning of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, did not show very much about his work, but was more pleased to show that the purchase programme of state paper on the secondary market would "continue" and that we would "see how the decisions will be made on Thursday at the meeting".
Only certainty: The ECB will place its leadership unchanged by 1%, the historical lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bonds purchases of the shadow chamber were doubled by the ECB over the last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to instructions from some dealers, they should have made new purchases in Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
Among the dealers, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase course is never repeated (see page 29).
People's rights are no longer expected to be a significant change.
If loans are already lost from the ECB's Arsenal for more than three months, they will still be made available to the unlimited cash reserves in a voluntary manner, over a period of one week to three months.
People's rights have already become aware that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
"In other cases, they would risk putting new efforts into short-term search," says Michael Schubert, the World Bank of Commerce.
"For the first quarter of 2011, progressive increase seems to me to be more likely," predicts Norbert Brams, Volkswitt at Sal.
Openheim.
In the area of their intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchase under obligations which sustains the labour market", Norbert Brams adds.
In view of the relevance of the European banks’ exposure to the euro area debt markets, the central bank has no choice to maintain its presence on the market.
"They must make every price available to the people of the missing investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent early interest on the payments paid to the poorest countries," said an important obligor yesterday.
Because if the interest rates were applied to high-flights, the countries would be further prevented from reducing their debt or simply stabilising it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The government of Berlusconi goes to Italy to cover
After a week’s break for Italy, the situation was somewhat tense yesterday with the decline of the Ecksins for 10 years.
A return to the triangular steel.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional president, Giulia Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "unprecedentable" and had heard it with a "unpredictable" weekend, however, what immediately demented the matter.
On Tuesday, however, the shadow with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts for the coverage of the competition risk had been at 263 points, which had highlighted a certain uncertainty in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had indicated in his Council that the Spanish discrepancy is based on the German interest rates at 400 base points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had been marked as "hardly concerned" by the "market bubbles" and a possible risk of arrest from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In short, the problem is that the absence of economic growth and the current, rapid tax incentives that threaten the state cannot cover its financing needs anymore.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 will be expected... although the budget in the Senate is estimated at 1.3% relatively 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will be reduced by 4.3% of GDP in the next year (with the government's 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (stated 2.7%).
This is why a new set of budgets could also be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new spare measures must be taken," said economic inspector Olli Rehn.
Italy receives support from international institutions for an hour.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are in order, which we have been continuing for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who has been in charge of the IWF with Italy.
"There are no problems at the moment, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since Italy, despite its high guilt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is expected to have less stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Paduan, Head of the OECD.
The question remains after political instability.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will be presented with a motion for a motion for a resolution from the Chamber of Appeal, which could be organised by the end of March.
There is therefore a low-priced period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had just raised it in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I believe it has been proven on Sunday and on the evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to protecting their currency and their currency."
Despite the relatively relatively recent decline in the benefits of European State obligations, water was at the heart of governments and the ECB.
However, since a normalization, it cannot be the conversation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that they could restore the debt mark of Portugal, which is probably today the most effective target target of the speculators.
"As in May there is a real lack of clarity and political certainty, which is especially on banking systems," says the opinion of the peoples' values of the Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, "the political time is much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are aware of the danger of both this wave and the danger involved, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and their opponents of the G20 go well.
And this also takes into account the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The aim is to reduce the number of non-conventional measures to strengthen the countries of the euro area in the face of the market (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, their Executive Director Klaus Regulation has already started his Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Fernot about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If his visit is not an express fundraiser, he will certainly prepare for it.
The first issue of securities from the EU Stability Fund is planned for the next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the Reuters Agency entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the additional direct commitment of the IWF fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first line, are sending structural reforms, in particular in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be taken to the savings measures, however, should show the effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid have described another way in which they have done this in Greece and Ireland.
Both one and the other are to avoid any price it is necessary to request international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and have decided on unfavourable structural reforms which will bring them back to confidence.
The European capitalaires also have the options available to speed up the normalisation process of state loans.
Axel Weber, who was on the move to Paris on 24 November, had first developed the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to move back into its own pocket.
The public debt of Barclays Capital, with regard to the European public debt market as a whole based on existing actors, would be sufficient for an extension of around 100 billion euros, in the form of a direct liquidity dispute.
This means that the European mechanism for financial stabilization is now EUR 60 billion.
A party which has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the main European cities.
Especially when market conditions arise.
Snow and ice cream: 24 Departments in Alarmstufe Orange
The snowy episodes continue to lead to traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary traffic networks of Britain, and attempt to interfere with various economic activities.
Four-and-a-half departments are now in alert stage Orange because of the disturbing snow and ice risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loire, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have already reached 20 departments that are already in alert stage Orange; 18 since midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, so later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intensive skiers speak the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it is fast on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, cut covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandi, Ile-de-France and Limousin are concerned.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to raise traffic barriers and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, more than 7.5 tonnes of heavy traffic is closed, including the traffic bags of Guangamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludéac.
The situation of the secondary transport networks in Britain is said to be very difficult for traffic police to use their own vehicle only when necessary, and the use of some TE bus has been suspended all day.
In the Picardie, school transport was increased for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the medium-term.
The Prefecture "needs the driver to be more careful about the roads and the appropriate adjustment of their driving behaviour."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to catch 25% of their passengers on Thursday from the Paris Airport Roissy and 10% of Orly's starting flights due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airlines.
The Gatwick Airports in south London as well as the Airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, were closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial disputes
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France has been in full progress, it is billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is called to mind.
In order to lead the construction of the GDP in the way, the State has issued a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would allow the SGP to give on the markets a share of the financial sum to its twofold.
Today it has finally come to first calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was adopted by the Commission of the National Assembly on this morning, contains the measures envisaged to contribute to the first part of this money.
This is a two-way approach: the creation of a special fee for completion and higher control of the offices on the Ile-de France.
First of all, as adopted by Article 15 of the Constitution, "the benefit of the public-law agency Société du Grand Paris".
This is said to be: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Second, it is a new order of existing corporate control: "to modernise it to increase it from its product and to respond to this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that take?
It's a puzzle.
This sum is not related to the text.
From the 4 billion, you're far away.
"It is estimated that the taxable resources will be allocated to the EUR 4 billion of the capital taxation imposed by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris will be set up after and after the project," the statement should be taken.
At the SGP, this system is not even attacked.
"From the moment you've been hiding the revenue (the two taxes, R.), you can cover the project over three years and then create from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget and taken back and forth."
The GDP is committed to start 2013 to notify the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which is still able to seek out the four billion promised years, is a risk of calling for a legitimate parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Fascinating hacker and enamel spy
The WikiLeaks case has a double significance.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of integrity that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and it foresees the future dominated by regression.
But let's move forward.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act made by a secret service (an x-like nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary" American enthusiasts about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do nothing more than what you have been able to read in months as well as in every x-like journal (other than their own Berlusconi), and the amazingly characterised profile Gaddafis bot Cabaret artists have been busy for a long time.
The rule that the hidden files may only consist of news already known, is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and that is not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated to the Assyrian publications, you will realize that every work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Temple or the Rosen Kreuzler) exactly repeats what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish any research (even because he did not know where to find news about non-existencers), but because of those who turn to occultism, nothing but the belief that they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The secret powers, too.
The informant is false, and Faul (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (also, he could always be anything, for example, editor at libération), who only considers to be true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message to the state branch in Rome was the same as those that had already published the Newsweek week before.
So why was such an increase in the contents of this folder made?
On the one hand, this is what every trained person already knows, and although the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government heads can call each other or take a plane to meet at night - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have changed to spy centres.
Every viewer of media films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of sincerity that you do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the duty of integrity and serves to put American diplomacy into a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-advisor hacker can capture the secrets of the world's most powerful country is the great fight against the prestige of the state.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "scrapers" in stress.
But we look forward to the profound nature of what is happening.
First of all, at Orwell's times, you could pray all the power as a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Whether prophecy could have been completely correct since it was possible to check every move thanks to the phone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the chosen car and so on; the citizens would be the total victim of the power.
But if you look at what appears today that even the secret encryptions of power can no longer be controlled by a hacker, then the control process is about to be directed one-sided and will be circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the hero of the citizen - can bring into experience the secrets of the power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be buried); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Markels is basically a secret free of secrets, as it presupposes the public sphere; but in the way of WikiLeaks, the secrets of Hillary Clinton are empty secrets, meaning that they have any power to acquire.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this disorder, which has been added to such a powerful force?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will not be able to make any more available information on the Internet - which would be similar to a reference to the roadline.
But it is also obvious that it is dedicated to the current technologies to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a stateman moves on in a plane and contacted a colleague.
In the future, how could a particular relationship be maintained in private and only for certain ears?
I know very well that at the moment my predecessors are listening to science fiction and romance, but I see it useful to suggest to me the government agents to move in a secret way to uncontrollable routes, to hide their messages from anywhere other than in the mind of themselves, and in addition to the few written information they have received, in the course of the course.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically the spy test of watergate would have been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today technology is moving forward as a cancer, i.e. backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to discover a band band by being able to jump from behind and lift all the secrets of the mount, while today's (numerical) CDs do not allow anything else than to jump from chapter to chapter, so in macros.
With the high speed train, you can travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this takes about three and a half hours, including by plane.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what had been damaged for secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require reliable information from the press.
Climate: how France's financial promises are beautiful
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the rapidly resolved financing agreements (also referred to as "fast start" or early funding) which have been implemented by the developing countries.
And they're already covered by the great French beauty.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the basis of the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all records to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fixed start-up financing: detailed progress report by its Member States, press conference, large drawbacks, distribution of brochures.
The operation transparency is marked and graded for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see if all developed countries made the same precision level.
The EU is pleased to have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which will lead to its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been made, without sufficient public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission has proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the right value that he considers best.
The EU Commission has, for example, set itself out as a guideline for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained, and it has been available for three years for 150 million years under the "Standard Start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either for the year or for conditions at the level of public development aid.
In this regard, France considered the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development assistance.
In concrete terms, the sum of the French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also withdraw) - France proposes to maintain its commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the settlement of funds and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses his accounting mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 eligible € equivalent to 1 handed-over €.
Clearly, this is only difficult to represent: the power is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (i.e. projects linked to emission reduction based on more efficient technology) can be justified, it would be a challenge to present the euro which is agreed to be equivalent to a distributed euro... only the costs of the loan for the capitalised country should be estimated as an undertaking (i.e. the equivalent of a profit rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following: it "responses" its commitment to EUR 420 million by taking 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that loans are used in a large way.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) to comply with their obligations to 100%.
In other words, if the excessive majority of the European Union spends 1 € to meet its obligations, France only gives 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
In all, France operates in its fixed-start financing with a double shift: to a part with a further development of the action over time and to another part with the reality of financial use.
France fails to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises and saved 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Berty who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect on itself; once in the EU, why do the other Member States continue to spend their money if it is sufficient?) and then in the negotiations that the developing countries are not going to be completely confused...
The chapter of the early funding is just a small issue for relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be too much in the immense machine of UNFCCC.
We hope this won't be the case.
As is always the case, it is imperative to learn his lesson from this first year's early funding.
Firstly, France could declare a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward discussions on the nature of the long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently under discussion): the question of the 'reliability' or the nature of its loan cannot be raised.
France could change its position in order to be further on the issue of conflict as it is in other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, which will be held next week in Cancún.
A surprising announcement on the stand-start of France and its vision of the "responsibility" and the use of loans would be from nature from the international confidence base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - of children single pesticides
A 10-year-old child takes in 81 different chemical substances over the day, thus a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (one-time movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that its results "in view of the low number of analysed samples did not repeat any statistically significant value, but showed an illustration character of the problem-treated", had normally bought food from about four, from a child about ten years of age at mealtimes, plus an intermediate period in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meal times - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were also examined as nurseries of laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other harmful substances.
The teller balance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42, possibly or possibly cancer-related substances and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine-stor factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for any chemical, individual-intensive substance are not exceeded in the immediate context of the case, it is very good to take this collection into account that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to corrosive substances or substances with endocrine agent is a concern," notes the Association.
Already in the morning, only the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as planned for the midterm study, shows six chemical substances, including a fungiicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green bona fide from Kenya, which is included in the mid-terms in which the study has established traces of a highly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksterak, the tuna fish from the bucks, even the baguette and the kaugumi of pesticides and other chemical substances were cut off.
In the management water, the analyses brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
On the evenings, the lachsteak was discovered with 34 chemical residues at the "stainest" and even the plastics used to heat up the meal in the microwave were not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this "drug cocktails" for consumers "will probably be underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "sustainment of civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
