What did you buy?
They say it's up to you.
Koala's no match.
Here we go.

It's a boy.
I don't think so.
I've never liked biology.
I've got a new car.
I can't eat chicken.
Next
I'm not going to Boston and Tom.
Corona virus has begun in China.
Is Tom a member of your party?
I love you.
You've got a pretty nose.
I'm not going to speak French to you anymore.
I'm Tom.
I went to bed four hours a day.
Emily's writing useful.
They fight.
Italian is the language of the country.
This is bullshit!
Say hello.
I think you're right.
He died three years ago.
A plane.
Tom said Mary didn't think John did that.
It's too much. It's too expensive.
I'm tired of hard work.
I don't need to answer your question.
I thought they'd hear us.
Speak clearly.
I told La and Tom.
God created you with a purpose.
There's something you need to know.
I don't understand.
Where's your father?
If you care, tell me, I'll give you his beer.
Where's your school?
The defendant was convicted of murder by the courts.

She's been fighting for the last time.
He's been a long time, but now he's fine.
You respect your boss like your father.
Do you know who broke up?
I told them to send another bag.
I'm talking about it.
Ready?
Listen to me.
Because they're watching TV.
I'm hungry.
I hate Tom for a lot of reasons.
Great!
Don't worry about anything.
It's just a word.
Push
Sometimes it's necessary to hide the truth.
Supe is too hot. I can't eat it.
Tom warned Mary that she had to do it today.
Do you really have to do that today?
It's a prize.
Tom is that guy?
Who knows?
Follow me.
Let's talk about our own business.
Did you eat pizza?
Mary's hiding Barry in the woods.
Two adults.
I know.
I live here.
Open the door to love.
I'm the one they want.
These for you.
He's looking at the sky.
Don't worry.
You must be kidding me.
Use this.
Drive carefully.
Are you busy?
Where do you live?
Can I borrow your phone?
Let's try something.
Tom said he wanted to do that.
I'm a reporter.
There are many islands in the sea.
I got it!
I forgot his name.
We see different things, whether we're rich or not.
My love for him has fallen.
Hello, new year.
I used to want to be a physicist.
Let's play!
He speaks Chinese.
You should sleep.
I have a car.
I'm happy with my job.
We're men.
He's very good.
Please send this document last month.
Open
I did this for my family.
I read the New York Times.
I need your love.
Do you remember?
How long have you been talking to Tom?
I'm free tonight.
You have a lovely face, don't you?
Why would Tom do that today?
It's very good yesterday.
It's mine.
It's the truth.
Now you're very busy.
I like you.
How much do you think of my service for my credit?
What is my punishment?
You shouldn't have made a promise.
Japan's airspace is smaller than England.
It took Jane 20 hours to fly to Japan.

I got 100 euros a day.
Is it far from here?
I'm 19 years old.
Now I don't have time.
Tom says he's happy to do it.
I won't do that.
I like your offer.
Do you think Tom can help us?
I can't eat chocolate.
Is that what you're saying?
I've always liked the darker.
We saw him as a good brother.
Does your husband have a lot of enemies?
We're a country that loves peace.
Using your computer helps you schedule time.
People don't like what they don't understand.
Tom's words ended with the extra reason.
What do you think of Tom's attitude?
Get out of the way.
So is Tomgren.
Did you find the book you were looking for then?
I just don't know what to say.
I'm learning my mother tongue.
That's great!
I need you.
You need to control yourself.
And give thanks to yourself, and they will give thanks to you.
The change in social conditions is urgent.
What's Tom's got in mind for doing?
He decided to be a pilot.
How's Australia?
I can't believe it!
I can't help you, even if I'll calm you down.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Please don't give me food.
I've got a lot to do.
Are we going to watch the movie now?
The real problem is you don't even know we have a problem.
Did you really tell Tom that?
It's a mouth.
Did I eat chicken last night?
I can't eat this.
Your answer was wrong.
Show me.
I'm lying in the ocean.
We love you.
I like Japanese girls.
What do you think?
I'm tired of being arrested. Do you have any drugs?
You have the ability to sing.
This is for Tom.
He speaks Chinese.
Warn Tom.
I've seen the goal.
Do you have enough money?
Two boys are on the roof.
She's growing up as a ready woman.
I'm sick.
I think everyone should learn another language.
Follow him.
You're tired.
I might have lost it.
Tom and Mary are Canadians.
That looks fun. I want to try it.
Don't worry. I'll protect you.
It's Harp.
He asked me what my name was.
Don't trade up as fast as six in a big city.
I'm on it.
Do you want to tell La?
Tom and I will be fine.
What do you want?
I'm hot.
There's a glass of water on the table.
She can speak French.
It's up to you.
Some say you shouldn't check the e-mail first thing in the morning.
I have time.
I'll try to make a meal.
Tom says how long he's gonna be?
I'm not going to die.
What do you want to eat?
Where are you going? We've got a lot more time, so drive safely.
The air is thick and the ground is flat.
What kind of person are you?
Beautiful life.
He bought a new car.
I'm out.
There's nothing going on.
Accept what you're saying. I think you're wrong.
What are you talking about?
How many friends do you have?
Frees!
Do you see that humans are not the creators of time, because if we do, time will not end.
The best book about life is that life.
You're not my mother.
Do you need to go?
He ran away.
What is it?
Help Tom.
Tom at school?
I'm a father, a mother.
I don't know how I can do it.
Find a job.
Why can't you come?
No one except Tom did that.
I like the Arandby song.
How old are you?
Once, there was a bridge here.
You want to do it with me?
Wow!
I'm a cop.
There's a way out.
Tom's gone.
Is your mom okay?
Whenever I find something I like it's going to be too hard.
You missed that, didn't you?
I have the right to judge.
I miss you.
I've been trying to look in the mirror all the time.
We'll go there at 2:30.
Arabic will be read from the right to the left.
That's what Tom said.
She's smiling.
He's got a lot of money.
You can't stay without water.
I won't say that.
It's a pig.
I've seen Jan Yufo.
I don't blame you.
Mary's dog is a lot bigger than Mary's dog.
I'm going.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
We have a problem, too.
I'm sick.
Let's try it.
Why do you ask?
Can I borrow a book for a while?
It's TV.
Dictionary is the base of the language.
She's a bitch.
I can't eat.
Answer the question.
What do you want from me?
How did Tom do it?
That looks nice. I'll try.
She asked him to stay.
I'm working.
Let's try it again.
He's probably my sister's good husband.
I've got two horses.
This is the book you're looking for.
How's Tom?
Muriel is 20 years old.
What's this for?
Stop!
We won.
You should be proud of yourself and you should be honored.
It's me.
Who gave you your clothes?
They opened the door.
It's okay.
I'm a teacher.
I'm a fucking patient.
I'm fine.
You should let Tom do what he wants to do.
No problem.
She was afraid that Mareen would kill her husband before their nephew was born.
Any job that can cause pain.
I'll be fine.
He used to be a kid when he was a kid.
Yeah.
I think it's best if you don't mind.
I was in him then.
This is the moon.
She's pregnant.
He believed they destroyed it.
Tom says Mary's coming in for dinner.
Do you like Mary?
The clock has two hands.
We're going over the river.
Watch out.
It's fine.
I like him.
You look great.
You're so hot with me.
He likes it.
Tom's lying.
I can't eat the chicken.
The car's here.
We're one.
I doubt Tom has any reason to do that.
Please open this box.
Have you ever seen how to make a spell?
You won't like this.
Don't waste your time on stupid matters.
It's impossible!
Who's Tom?
I'll go there even if the rain falls.
Look at me when I talk to you!
Write me something.

The virus is spreading rapidly.
In the worst case, we'll have to be as happy as we can.

The football can stop because of the rain.
Let's do it!
Do you drink coffee?
What do you want me to do with these things?
You should knock the door before you come in.
Answer me.
Let's see what's the worst that could happen.
I can't go.
Not a new book.
Are you tired?
He's gone.
In Canada people speak English and French.
You're not gonna do it?
I found what you were looking for.
He doesn't know anything.
It's time to wake up.
No, my passport's gone!
Most of us want to do that.
1. It's telling us what choice we make. Two.
Let's go!
It's not my fault.
He's drunk.
It's raining.
Are you writing a letter?
Hi, my name is Tom.
What do you mean?
I'll go with Tom and Mary.
Tom doesn't speak French.
She'll make a good wife.
Is that you?
Tom doesn't want to talk to Mary.
We'll eat lunch together at half an hour.
Tomme.
Should we do this?
I'm looking for someone who's wearing clothes for me.
How does that relate to me?
Chowd-19 changed the patient's cell to the virus factory.
During the summer I went to the sea, during the winter I went to the mountains.
Have fun.
I wonder why Tom didn't come to Mary's party.
I'm a Thai.
Keep it away from the hands and eyes of the child.
Hold it!
Can I help you?
He ran away.
Who?
Construction began on October 20, 2556 C.E.

He's not far from here.
It's his.
He's sleeping like a kid.
"Thank you." "It's okay."
You guys want some water or coffee?
Tom wants you to do it.
Where did you come from?
I love you.
Do you have a mouth in the car?
What time is it now?
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
My job just started.
Men were born to us, and children were born to us; and we were all born equal in the image and in the likeness of God, even in holiness and in righteousness and in uprightness.
I'm the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the same.
Why me?

Allow the student to drop out of school.
Where is he?
What's the name of that boy?
Tom.
Tom bought the last thing in the house.
He's looking at kids, but he's actually over forty years old.
She's walking.
I've finished reading this book.
I haven't spoken Indonesian yet.
A woman has a beautiful solution.
How could Tom do that?
I'll be right back.
Tom said he wanted to do that.
This is what's always happened.
Do you like milk?
We agree.
I like apples.
I'll learn French for a while.
I'll try not to be late tomorrow.
Tom hasn't cleaned up yet.
I love you more than you love me.
I lost my wallet.
Your clock is ten minutes late.
Tom, run.
Tom and I are fine.
I don't want to stay in Boston until Monday.
It's cold.
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
I feel so deep about you.
I only have one book.
It's not your business.
Tomorrow he'll walk out of Chicago.
I'm looking around.
I hope we didn't wake you.
I don't know if there's time.
You should learn more.
We're okay.
What does Tom need?
I'm a light.
He doesn't have a child.
Tomka.
I don't know how old she is.
Open the video.
Do you like Japanese food?
Don't do that.
Who are you?
My mom's gone crazy.
I doubt where Tom's going to get that picture.
I don't eat med apples.
Do Tom and Mary have to do that?
Is that from Tom?
My mother opened the door carefully.
Of course!
Why didn't Tom come last night?
Every morning I went out to shopping.
I can't use that kind of life.
Are these yours?
That's it.
I'm sorry.
Where is he?
Give me a couple of days.
I think it's the best way.
What do you think of Tom's blog?
I'm afraid they can't go together.
I'm sorry. I can't go.
How lonely would this world be without you?
It's a good night.
We've got a lot of additional answers.
I'll let things go as they are to avoid the problem.
It's hot yesterday.
Let's go find a job.
Where are you?
You should be proud of yourself and you should be honored.
He used to eat breakfast here.
It's in the sky.
Tom and his brother have very different connections.
They're like a family.
Mike's in his body two to three times a week.
We should get together.
That's not okay.
I wouldn't drink it if I were you.
I ate apples.
I get it.
I'm not a doctor.
How do we do that?
I like chess.
It's hard to focus on breaking the rules.
I'm a professional.
The password is "Muiriel."
How are we gonna do with Tom?

Helen Keller is blind, deaf, and blind.
There's a hole in the garden.

I'm afraid we'll be too late.
Is your mom home?
I asked people around, and everyone said Tom was a good person.
Have you ever seen the sun rise? It's beautiful.
We're going to the hunt.
At the end of the day, I had the courage to tell her, "I love you!"
Where are you going?
I hope I can do it myself.

Can you use that?
You're so brave.
I'm not all tired.
I'm tired.
Too hot. I can't eat it.
I can't speak Japanese.
I'm freezing water.
Stop it.
She doesn't have a mouth.
Can you keep it secret?
I saw something moving out there.
I'm not going with you.
Hello!
Pray. Pray.
Two months ago, I had a job experience.
- 30 euros. - Yes.
Help me.
Listen.
We'll eat lunch together at half an hour.
I think he's my brother.
The food finally arrived on the table.
I'm from Budapest.
Who do you mean?
Hello, everybody.
That's enough!
Okay, that's it.
Call the police!
Oh, my God, I'm in business.
It's time to go to sleep.
I'm crying.
For oral use
I don't know if there's any time.
We went to the museum to study Japanese history.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please send your home.
You speak English.
We can't do that right now.
Tom likes it there.
I like Chinese food.
Have you eaten?
Social culture has changed in every country.
Is this the book you're looking for?
Most people write about their daily lives.
Cheer!
I used to have a horse.
Tom said bad things about me.
You're a smoker?
Tom's mind was stirred.
No one invited me.
There's nothing I can do without the shock.
Ask a woman anywhere.
Sit down.
You look better than me.
Tom didn't expect this.
Color's right with you.
I want to try it.
I'm not going to school.
Tell Tom.
Good evening.
Catch him.
This is Japan.
He's just a politician.
Are you tired or are you just kidding?
It's a lie. It's a lie.
I won't be happy, but I won't kill myself.
We'll eat lunch together at half an hour.
I don't know if you know, but in America, you're supposed to give a kid a job.
Am I wrong?
I want to tell La.
Is this your car?
Are you okay?
This is my book. It's his ring.
We're fine.
He did what he promised.
It's kind of weird for me.
We're kidding.
What did they say?
What are you and Tom doing?
How's the job?
Tom's on the run.
I'd like to go to play in town.
What?
Say it in time.
Take the tom.
We should celebrate.
Everything's ready.
What are you doing?
Please come in. Open the door.
It won't happen.
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan to do that.
I don't want to work under these circumstances.
Tom might know Mary.
The easiest way to solve the problem is always the best way.
It's done!
I hope you can come with us.
Why aren't we told the truth?
A lot of people like to walk.
Russia is worse than Starlot.
It's a fire.
You're not a businessman.
I don't want to go.
When did the mistake happen?
One can always find time.
I'll be right back.
You should sleep.
Call me.
Don't lose patience.
I'll sign for you.
Is it yours?
Tom wants to see Mary.
I want to say something.
1 March was the day when many Japanese went to court.
I'm not a member of this club.
Happy Christmas!

I'm a coward.
Don't worry about it. Life's going up and down.
Tom's got a cold in his coffee instead of a cold.
Did you eat coffee?
Which is the smallest star?
Wait.
Do you want to go now?
I know Tomgren.
We're gonna be okay.
Ready?
Listen.
Their apples aren't ours.
I hope my teacher's excited to work.

Meredith was Mary's friend.
Tom paid for it.
Money is money.
What do you want?
I agree.
Son of a bitch.
The exact meaning is, okay, it's settled. - Okay, then.
We all have to die, whether we have money or not.
You're making me tired!
Actually, the man you saw was a woman.
I want to do it right away.
We'll be okay.
My wife wants to talk.
If you pay the discount on the 5th day, you're going to be added.

How are you at school?
She told La.
There's no way!
Hello, Tom.
Take it easy.
These aren't your books?
They're alive as if they were hungry.
There are many islands in the sea.
He's proud of himself.
I'm Tom in Boston.
In the past, all the kids were able to distinguish between bad and bad.
My mother's a science professor.
Shut up!
Say it!
My sister gave me a new watch.
Why are you crying?
No! No!
You may be too heavy that makes you sleep unsatisfied.
I'm lying.
Her name is Maria.
Tell her I'll call back later.
The same language is never enough.
Let's go.
That's it.
How many hours is it?
God, who gives us all life and freedom at the same time.
Tom always sees everything in the brain.
Let's go now.
No one's with Tom.
Tom's gone.
I'm staying.
I need you.
I'm watching TV.
What's her name?
That soldier never got to fight.
I'm not a big animal.
Stop.
I'm so tired.
Construction started on October 20, 2013
I used to speak Russian.
Except for the distance from each vehicle and the other angles between the vehicle.
We're eating apples.
Did you come back from Japan?
He's probably my sister's good husband.
I need love.
They're gone.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hit it.
Are you married?
Who cares?
Do you have anything in the evening that I can eat?
How's Tom?
My son wants to talk.
Tom's not far from Boston.
Are you sure?
He left the team because he didn't join the manager.
Tom's going fast.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
You mustn't believe it!
I used to speak Russian.
No, the house in my village isn't high, but it's big.
I'm English.
I'll try not to interfere with your studies.
Go away!
What I want is love.
What are you talking about?
Me, too.
Tom's doing that.
Is this the last picture?
Most of us have to do that.
How did you find a mistake?
Thank you. I'm here right now.
What's going on?
I've seen a hard tree in the yard.
I'm very tired.
I'm gonna sell this dog if it's higher.
How's your dad?
I'm free.
While we were going to the holiday stop, a friend of the house was helping us take care of our horses.

That's enough.
Sit down on the sofa.
Most people think I'm crazy.
It's Tom.
Where did you go to Australia?
That way.
Tom likes to do that.
Are you there?
Get inside.
It's too hot.
The only result of the surgery is the eye.
Tomgren.
It's never gonna end.
I don't like you anymore.
It's up to Brift.
Believe me!
That's because you're a woman.
Shoot!
I'm enjoying food in Australia.
I like watching the movie.
I don't have any money.
Even if he's gonna apologize, I'm still angry.
You're young.
I don't want to go to school.
It's a new train.

Tomkin Sandwich for lunch?
They should apologize.
Is it a regular or long time mistake?
I have to go to bed.
Do you want a stick tonight?
Tom and his brother have very different connections.
Have you ever come home?
Are you crazy?
Is it raining?
We're gonna be okay.
You look so excited.
What's this?
What are you looking at?
I'll think about Tom.
Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, we are the children of God.
Show me joy!
Clear
Please tell me where you're going.
Tom's sitting in the dark, smoking.
Tom taught French.
They're mine.
