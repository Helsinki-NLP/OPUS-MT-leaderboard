Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "making the image of the pagans"
There is a continuance between some Members of the Assembly on the proposal to amend their title in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Wales Parliament).
This proposal is a result of the programmes to amend the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Laburist Party Assembly said that his party is concerned that "he can stay with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Wales, twp means creatinine and pwp means cat.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group in the group "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Gallegese Conservative Party claimed to be "open" towards the change of name, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (pagliaccio).
In this context, the letter W in Gallese is spoken in a similar way to the English pronunciation of the Yorkshire letter U.
The Committee on Assembly Affairs, which is currently in the process of introducing the amendments to the names, stated: "The final decision on any possible descriptions of how the members of the House will be called will obviously be a debate for the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Gallegese Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which provided broad support for the possibility of calling the Assembly of Wales.
With regard to the title of the members of the House, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Gallegese Parliament), but the MWP option was given more consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs appear to be proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could arise with a thanks to President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative proposal on changes within a few weeks.
The Law on Reform will include further amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on their behalf during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians call on the Uranus for the referendum on the amendment of the country's name
Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name in "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote has been organised in an attempt to end a dispute for decades with the bordering Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long stated that its name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly been opposed to its requests for EU and NATO accession.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia, an opposition from the Plenary for the amendment of the name, said that he would not take account of the vote.
However, the rapporteurs, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in name is simply the price to be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
The streets of St. Martin's are closed while the churches of Harlem are in difficulty
"The elders I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner in the past," Adams said.
"Today there are none of the two."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People's socialism differently today," he explained.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood halls that people frequent regularly."
As for the churches, it is concerned that the money arising from the sale of patriarchs will not last as long as the leaders wait, "and before or after they will return where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condoms filled with the type of people who will not help the remaining saints in the district.
"The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and for that reason they will face the moment when these churches close everything because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by confraternites before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The first white methodist congregation, if it went in the '30s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was purchased by a black congregation with the head of Governor John Howard Johnson, who led the deceit against the dealers of the 125th street, one of the main roads for shopping in Harlem, who refused to take or promote people of colors.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners planned his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
King David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the "the fields of the poor."
The expert who sounded the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be sung by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon to the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What was staged in St. Martin's last few months was a complex frame of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the church's lay officials, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, consisting of a lay leader, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns about the fact that the diocese "was trying to download the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter was not involved in the acquisition of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Squalo for a 13th century in the fishing of aragosts in California
Official sources say that on Saturday a squall attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was hiding in the search for aragost in California, during the opening day of the Aragost season.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV of San Diego that from now on he was hanging out with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a kid screaming and he sat down with him with a group of people to get him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that he was just excited about the capture of an aragost, but then he realized that the boy was crying ‘I was dead!
I've been murdered!'
His whole clavicle was lacerate," said Hammel once he met the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a hole in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transported with an helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was recovered under critical conditions.
The species responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles has declared during a communication to the media that weeks before he was warned in the area of a squall, but that he was declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim immediately suffered traumatic injuries in the upper area of the chest.
The authorities have forbidden access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles has reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a drive towards the beauty sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large store assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive towards the market for beauty products from 2.8 billion stars in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while sales in fashion and articles for the house decrease, the biggest courses devoted to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in more businesses next year in the event of success.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting new ways to use space on stairs once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and articles for the house.
Sainsbury's said he would have doubled the sizes of his beauty product until it reached 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with brandy areas similar to those present in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also expanding its range of Boutique trucks so that most of the products are vegan - a quality that is always more required by the younger buyers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will experience the authorisations in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which has opened in Croydon, southern London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a move towards the purchase of small quantities of food daily in small neighborhood shops have forced supermarkets to undertake more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points will always agree to the big stores as the supermarket chain seeks to resist discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced the sales points Argos in hundreds of shops and has also introduced several habitats since he bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has prompted food sales and made the most profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to cancel its distribution of beauty and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's has tried a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the year 2000 but synergy has ended up in a dispute about the division of income from pharmaceutical sales points in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold three years ago its pharmaceutical activity of 281 points sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million stars.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four shops of an extended range of luxury brands of products for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the aspect of our distributions of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in well-formed colleges that will be available to offer advice.
Our brand range has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, contrary to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "furish" after Holly Willoughby signed an agreement of 11 million stars
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is angry after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrawn from a 11 million-star contract with its trend mark to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no more time for his brand of Casalinghi and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This morning's 37-year-old representative has appealed to Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons De, Peter Jones, angry after being withdrawn from their credit rating activities in the last minute to concentrate on his new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "frequent" when the gold girl of TV admitted during a meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million sterline - did not leave her enough time to devote to their brand of housing and Truly accessories.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was calculated that would have doubled Willoughby's heritage, estimated around 11 million stars.
Not long after Willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his residences for the holidays.
According to one source: "Truly was certainly Holly's highest priority.
It had to be his future in the long term that he would have committed to it for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave all the people involved completely without words.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a store full of products in Marlow's general district, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the resignation of this morning's representative, one of the United Kingdom's most productive stars, could cost the company millions due to strong investment in products coming from cousins and candles to dress and homeyears and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby invented Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, has joined the company as president in March.
The couple spent their vacation together and Jones had a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the TV program "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones stated last night that "he does not want to give comments on his business."
Words hard and "and we're in love"
He warned about the criticisms he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice to imitate the "television driver".
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho turned to the world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday, that North Korea has not observed a "equivalent response" from the United States to the first North Korea disarmament operations.
Rather, he stressed that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions once again to keep pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic vision of this speech.
"With North Korea we're getting excellent results," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent report."
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results: the end of the Missile Tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the rehabilitation of the last American military.
And he defended his unique strategy by describing his relationships with Kim.
"It's just to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded field, we'll have about 200 people right here," said Trump, pointing out the front page to himself.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were notified that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, national emergency was not declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it is a bit complicated," said Summung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
In conclusion, the national Christmas agency's representative stated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of the threats that Indonesia continues to be subjected to, the country continues to be extremely unarmed in the face of the anger of nature.
Although refugees were built at the tsunamis in Aceh, it is not a common structure at other costs.
The apparent lack of alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, to be found among the many islands of Indonesia is complex.
Natural disasters make logic even more complicated.
A hospital ship rented in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but they will want us at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of infrastructures in Indonesia's brands at the centre of his electoral campaign and has invested money in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has damaged the administration of Joko while preparing for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressures from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted the most conservative framework of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes because of encounters on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using masks, archives, and brakes and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool vs Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a failure in Premier League against Chelsea with a point at 89 minutes on Saturday, in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xerdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with his team below for 1-0.
He hit the left-hand ball before pulling on the second floor.
The attempt went high above the frame of the door as it turned towards the upper right corner of the network.
The ball is finally thrown into the back of Kepa Arrizabalaga by insacing itself into the net.
"I was just trying to put myself in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I tried to create as long as possible," Sturridge said in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I got a touch and I didn't think too much and I shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
The center of the Blue has passed out of touch with Matthew Kovacic before walking close to half the field and jumping in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick pass in half a field.
So he made a beautiful passage that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard has crossed the defense and finished on the second floor with a left-hand hole in addition to Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will meet Naples at the season of the Championships League at 15 a.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will have to face Videoton in UEFA Europe League at 3 pm on Thursday in London.

The Statute of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument taken from the date of "recording of history"
It would be a poetic justice for its Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by its Puritan fanatics.
But the Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "foliary" and a "test to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of the Statutes that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster became an objective.
The iconoclasty during the English civil war was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is the proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many consider to be still celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defencer of Parliament from external pressure, in his case of obviously monarchy.
That is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-19th century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of this fracture.
Its results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and remembered."
A Chinese farmer killed him.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a mayor in a market in South-West China by news spread by local media.
The man, identified only with the name "Yuan", was brought back to life with a rare artery, covered with blood near a porcelain on the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, referred on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A male farmer prepares to inject vaccines to the male in a tree on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
It is reported that he had traveled with the cousin from the bordering province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 fairs to the market.
The next morning, the cub found him dead and found out that the door of a nearby porcelain was open.
He said there was a big man with blood on his chest in his pocket.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg mass had destroyed the Alleviator, while in the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and maculated," said the dog identified with the nickname "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. to let him eat his meals.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the dog.
A market leader told the Evening News that the mayor had been arrested to prevent other people from being attacked, while the police collected evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the death of the lifter.
Although they are rare, cases of attacks on humans by cattle have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a mayor attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing a series of injuries to man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kg cornmeal hid a galley farmer to his tractor until the wife managed to escape the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was divorced by his grandparents in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the monkeys are not usually aggressive but that the blood's taste can function as a "catalizer."
"They just want to play.
They're funny, very curious... they don't want to do bad.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The strands of the Rosa Uruguayan will bring strong east bears in the south-west of the United States
As planned, the Rosa Iranian is losing strength as he moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and on the south-west coast of the United States in the next days.
Rosa registered up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 Et on Sunday and found 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a drought on the Pacific Ocean and is heading east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of the Baja California as a tropical storm, she will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north, in the south-western part of the United States.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of pizza in some areas of Mexico during the Monday day.
Thus, the tropical humidity in contact with the nearby sacrament will create heavy burdens and widespread precipitation in the south-west area in the next days.
At the local level, from 2 to 10 cm of poggia can cause hazardous flooding, floods of wastes and possible shores in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates reaching 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, especially in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations of 2,5-10 cm of poggia are planned in some areas of the south-west, in particular most of the Arizona.
It is possible to verify unexplored floods with conditions rapidly worsening due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong pears could make the canyons of the rivers full, and the weather will bring wind to sbuffies and lift dust.
The nearby saccating will cause strong local pulsions on the coast of southern California.
Precipitations of more than 1 cm will be possible, which may cause limited flow of destructive and scivolous loads.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the soft season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong pain will descend on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong warming oscillations in the USA while the article cools, but the tropics will remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to important temperature variations on short distances.
An outstanding example of sensitive temperature differences in Central America will be recorded on Sunday.
It will record a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the rest of the summer's heat will try to increase and expand again.
It is scheduled to begin in October for most of the Central and Eastern United States, with 26 oCs from the Southern Plains in the north-east.
In New York you will be able to reach 26 degrees Tuesday, i.e. a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a strong probability of temperatures above average for the East US until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the forthcoming deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have happened in the '80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
In the meantime, the political momentum continues, with the issuers who interrupt the regular programming for the last minute of the Friday: an agreement concluded by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake so that the FBI can conduct a week's investigation on the charges.
Ford has informed the Court of Justice that it is true to 100% of the fact that Kavanaugh had her in a state of weakness and tried to seduce her during a party at the top.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, claimed to be true to 100% that this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposit.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that have transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often finds it difficult to track the viewers following the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it's an audience similar to that for a football game or Oscar prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, led all the networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day, reported Nielsen.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million telespectors.
CBS registered 3.1 million Telespectors, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was arrested by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while she was attacked by demonstrators while trying to take a lift to a hearing of the Commission of Justice.
He was left with his eyes low for several minutes while he was retested and transferred from life to CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"You think I'm telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him, "You have the power, while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had released the statement and said before the elevator closed, which would have something else to say during the hearing of the Commission.
All cable networks and issuers have been transferred from live to live hours later when the Commission of Justice voted to present the name of Kavanaugh to the whole sitting on a vote.
But Flake said he would only have done so with the assurance that the FBI would have analysed the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the Democrats of the minority.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators subsequently, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused the "political making" critics of Brexit
First Minister Theresa May has accused who criticizes its programmes of allowing the European Union to "political face" with the future of Great Britain and rethinks national interests in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the prime minister on the first page of the daily, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, saying that a proposal according to which Britain and the EU should take their duties is "so ridiculous"
The murder of Wade Sims: the police arrests the suspect of the death of the LSU player Dyteon Simpson
The police arrested a suspect of the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and brought to prison on a second-grade murder charge, declared the baton Rouge police department.
The authorities made a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost his eyes during the night.
The police recovered their eyes from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, signaling the WAFB-related TV station.
After asking Simpson, the police said that the suspect allowed him to accidentally shoot Wayde.
The security was set at $350,000, he communicated to the lawyer.
The medical office of East Baton Rouge has issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gun shot from the neck to the neck.
The department recognized the importance of the task force for the refugees of the state of Louisiana, the police science laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area who provided assistance to the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU's athletic director thanked the forces of the area order for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where the father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
The short season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 replays.
Friday morning, LSU's coach Will Wade said that the team is "sconverted" and "under shock" for Wade's death.
"This is what you care about at all times," said Wade.
Volcano Cossages of Cemeteries Mexico City
The scene outside the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexicans of being away from the volcano, after the activity was increased in crater and 183 gas emissions and greenhouse gas emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various holes and corners.
Images on the media have shown subtitious scenes of scenes covering the parachutes of cars in Mexico City district as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in the activity corresponding to the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" is active since 1994.
Police interviews with Catalan separatists to monitor the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence exhibitors met with the anti-smomous police teams and thousands of people joined in demonstrations of opponents to remember the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on the session.
A group of masked separatists arrested by the anti-Smomous police beat the police with eggs and threw them into powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that often work on tourists.
Further meetings have been conducted during the day with police officers who have made use of manuals to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang "We won't forget, we won't forgive" were faced with the unicorns who shouted "Long Life in Spain."
The local press indicated that fourteen people had to receive treatment for leukemia received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The electors had voted with a striking majority for independence, although the flow had been low, and the Catalans against the section had voted widely.
In the presence of the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police tried to stop violent attacks on the referendum that was being held in all parts of the region.
Independent groups were gathered on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and claimed that he no longer had any hope of the possibility that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy for the possibility of voting, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory despite measures to the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independent parties have made it possible to maintain this year's balance, with many of the most famous leaders of the movement who find a voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians of the two factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for the end of the last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the involvement of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after expecting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly beat against a house in Londonderry.
The incident was checked at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday, about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the cancells and the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a stick at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston won the victory
Livingston has already promoted surprises to the Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second scoundrel in 18 parties as director of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's gol made the difference while Gary Holt's team passed the second division with the hybrid.
The Gerrard team therefore remains without a victory outside home in the Premiership this season and will have to face the next Sunday next Sunday in the Hearts class, from which 8 points separate them.
On Thursday the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
In the meantime, Livingston continues its series of victorys in the division, remaining covered by six parties, with the Coach Holt who has yet to see a squatt since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston has an opportunity against the few incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage before the goal, with their immediateity that caused many problems to Ranger.
Scott Robinson has broken down but has broken his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow has only been able to knock out the door after being inserted to meet Craig Halkett's head beat from the other side of the door.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have made it difficult for visitors to ride on foot.
And it was so that the cross-countrygol was realized.
The Rangers granted a penalty cut and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were able to pass through Menga, which was able to signal from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had ruled in the possession of the palace, but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and the porter Liam Kelly had no reason to worry too much,
This scheme was maintained during the second time, even though Alfredo Morelos had committed Kelly to a parapet.
Scott Pittman saw his attempt to stop his gol by the legs of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow took a shot out of another Livingston game.
Crosses have occurred in the Livingston area and have been continually neutralized, while two requests for resistance, after Halket's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by hand, have been rejected.
A "fenominal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a final result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they have been exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this extraordinary trajectory.
Their game styles and employees have changed slightly since they returned to the maximum series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he managed to spruce the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, head of a magically organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
Despite the best performances at some point with Gerrard, in this case they are well below these standards.
The last pass is missing - only once they have succeeded in entering the opposite area - and can be seen as a alarm campaign for the Rangers, which is half-classified.
Erdogan received with counter-reactions in Colonia
There were tears and the blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, to separate the relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of print and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan is therefore heading towards Colonia for the introduction of a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest group of Turkish people outside Turkey.
The police have for safety reasons caused the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have been present in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have heard their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The protests reflect the dissuasiveness caused by a visitor who considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a succession by others.
Road incident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in front of a car
A cyclist died on the scene with a car in London.
The incident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic route in Deptford, in the south-eastern part of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the floor.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist was fired, invested by a street pirate in Children's Street, about a mile from where the incident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police stated that the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his parents.
Roads and bus routes have been blocked and car drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lattin Prison: six guards injured during an accident
Six prison guards were injured during an accident in the maximum security male prison, he reported to the prison office.
The tumor is discovered at the maximum security male prison of Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST about Sunday and is still running.
Specialized "Tornado" agents have been used to manage the tumor, which involves eight prisoners and which is confined to a prison hall.
The agents were treated on site for mild eye injuries.
A prison service spokesman stated: "The prison staff appropriately formed was equipped to contain an incident currently under way at Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all the officers will be notified to the police and may be sentenced to longer prison sentences."
Long Lartin prison hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the arrest of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-somosa agents were called to intervene in prison to sit a violent mob during which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
The Uragano Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with inexplicable floods (which could benefit the areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression strikes the Arizona, but it is precisely what will likely happen at the beginning of the next week when the last energy of the Rosa hurricane will cross the south-west of the desert, creating unforeseen floods.
The national meteorological service has already released unplanned flood alarms for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to the southern and eastern Nevada, Southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will direct herself on Phoenix Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with pulge.
The national meteorology service of Phoenix has reported on a tweet that "only ten tropical cycles have kept the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an Uruguayan nearly 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Urigans provide precipitates between 5 and 10 cm, with small isolated up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west area, including central rocking mountains and Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with small isolated to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of unforeseen floods, the poggia taken by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods constitute a very serious problem, some of these precipitations will probably be positive because the south-west area is currently crossing a period of drought.
At the Center for the Monitoring of Sicity, less than 40% of the Arizona is passing through a period of extreme scicity, the second maximum category," said weather.com.
Initially, the path of the Rosa Uruguayan will be able to land on the ground through the peninsula of the Gulf of Mexico.
Rosa, who still held the Uragano force in the morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that he will arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Suspension on part of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitations are expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning with tropical depression, so that she will be headed through Arizona and South Utah in late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that could be caused by Rosa or her strategists is intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-western area of Sonora and in the south-western desert area of the United States," the National Centre for U.S.
It is expected that such storms can generate potentially lethal floods and floods of waste in the deserts, as well as coastal mountain terrain.
Aggression of Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a seven-year-old was found with gun wounds in Somerset.
The boy was wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
It was transferred to hospitals, where it remains under "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock's area, reported to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The authorities have made a call to anyone who may have taken over with the phone what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered for the catativity and the rebirth" of the democratic party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the bitter and bitter tactics of the democratic party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "striked for the catativity and anger" of the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh left before the Congress on Thursday, denying, in a passionate manner, Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford has also committed to the hearing defending himself from the charge.
The President said on that day that "the American people had been able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most expert legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with outstanding precedents in public service," he said in front of the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh by discussing the importance of republican influence in the midterm elections.
"For five weeks from one of the most important elections in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but I really do," he said.
"For this fight strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committed to "resisting and stopping."
The first basic procedural vote to the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh will be scheduled not later than Friday, as the CNN announced an senior assistant to the GOP.
Hundreds of people killed from the earthquake in Indonesia and tsunamis, and the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many displaced from where giants have fallen down on the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami have hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities have said Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu Friday, when, where up to 6 metres (18 feet) were covered on the beach at the crepuscal, spreading through many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
Tsunami has followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis occurred yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and are not running immediately, thus becoming victims," said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the founder of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"Tsunami has not only come, it has broken down with itself car, trunks, houses, it has hit anything on the terrace," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami has moved into the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 km/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people are out on the trees to escape the tsunami and are survivors, he explained.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Christmas Agency have shown many destroyed buildings and shops, surrounded bridges and cylindrical bridges and a pool surrounded by water.
The occupying costs continued to drain the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes has been observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) announced in a communication that the energy released from the heavy earthquake of Friday was nearly 200 times equal to the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bath, may have strengthened the dimensions of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "hesis" and claimed that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels are broken down.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the walls of broken buildings and added that 540 people remained injured and 29 were scattered.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in a area called Donghea, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralysed, with no information" from Donghea, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities had said that the waves had arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In a amateur video shared on the social media, a man is sitting in a top floor of a building crying in a hurry to warn of the tsunami coming people on the way below.
A few minutes after a water wall, he sat down on the beach, walking through buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the relief efforts.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending air cargo with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the refugees still need food and other goods from first need.
The city's airport has been opened only for grants and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
It's terrible.
Although the staff of the World Vision of Donghea has managed to reach the city of Palu, where the employees have fled under cover of the roof in their office's court, during the tragedy they have encountered a scene of destruction, Doseba said.
"They told me they've seen many destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the relief groups have initiated the difficult start operations of the relief measures, there have been some regrets about the fact that foreign relief operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian regulations establish that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, the founder of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., it's a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
The second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and family members of the dispersion still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that would relieve the many stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a child was pulled out of a drawer.
Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had been locked under the macaroni for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, the preparation of the Indonesian National Team of Parapendo, had trained for Asian Games that had ended this month in Indonesia two of the dispersed parapendo pilots.
Others included in Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandiya, were her students.
"As veterinary in the paramedics sector, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon reported how, in the hours following the broadcast of the Roa Roa Roa Hotel's scroll to the parish community, he had unexpectedly sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were closed to a single sign of gray spot instead of two blue signs.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Ruban ladri $26,750 during a banknote refurbishment at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's operator who was providing a banknote to Newport on the Levee, making a press release from the Department of Police in Newport.
The driver of the vehicle was driving a banquet in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver another money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the communication.
While he was busy, another man "was thrown into the back of Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified various suspects who fled the crime scene while in the press, but the police have not specified the number of people involved in the case.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name in Ye
The Kanye West rapper is changing his name in Ye.
Advertised on Saturday the change in the name on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally knows how Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as title of his eight album, which came out in June.
The change occurred prior to his participation at Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the song singer Ariana Grande, who has canceled his participation for "emotional areas", declared the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West stated in advance that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and meaning 'you' said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the Radio Big Boy.
"When they are you, they are us, it's us.
We have been through Kanye, which means the only one, simply Yes - the reflection of our goodness, our misfortune, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than the reflection of who we are."
It's just one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
An former West co-fellow, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without treatment and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the army against the civilian population
The Mexican elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use the military force against the civilian population, during the 50th anniversary of a bloodbath against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelco Square that "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when students on the left were taking their feet across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by expanding monthly subsidies to students and learning more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for IA
While China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds dedicated to research in this field, says IA Kai-Fu Lee's investor and operator, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements by various U.S. government groups on IA, even though in the United States there is generally no formal IA strategy.
In the meantime, China has presented its programme last year: it is ambitious to be the country No. 1 in IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget in the search for IA would be a good start being considered that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in the IA," said Lee.
The duplication of funding could double the possibility that the next major success in the IA sector would be achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editor's house Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synoving Ventures, who invested in one of the major IA companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an IA system that beat Otello's American player with the highest score and subsequently was directed at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee remembered the US government's previous technological competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when you'll have the next time, so you can identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that is leading academic leaders, they're multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been using lighting from universities to work on IA projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the United States to motivate its IA efforts.
"I think the green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he explained.
The Chinese Council of State published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those who work in academic institutions, as the National Foundation for Sciences and other governmental organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House has announced the formation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research on IA.
In the meantime, the US order to establish a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country in the Northern Republic of Macedonia, a move that would resolve the long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbours constitutes a pretence on its territory and has placed the blame on Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments have signed an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but national opponents believe that the change should damage the ethnic identity of the people of Macedonia by the majority of the slave.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote for the referendum and the polling campaign raised doubts about the possibility of affluence reaching at least 50% for the referendum's validity.
The question on the referendum is as follows: "It is in agreement with NATO and the EU accession and with the agreement with Greece."
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is the price to pay so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the flag of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change in the name would require a majority of two thirds in a paradigm.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularity until 1 p.m.
However, the flow was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters expressed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital elector, Skopje.
First Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum in Macedonia for the change in the name of the country which would open the door to NATO and the European Union's accession to Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small square and systeming the seats in front of the tents mounted by those who want to book the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter high-level, not for the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
First Minister Zaev states that NATO's accession will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which record a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of the voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required flow.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees planned to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said he would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the flow must be more than 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious attack on the government's policies in the Western world since it took place in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal to avoid the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took part in the defence of Brighton during the 2-0 Winter Games by Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero has made his point marked at 65 minutes seem extremely easy.
The Argentina attacker received a half-way pass at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before he caught himself in the open field.
It was then found by four green fig trees.
He humbled a defender before crossing different ones to the limit of the Brighton area.
So he made a left-hand pass, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to restore the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to beat the Bridgeton Mathew Ryan porter with a right arrow on the network.
"I'm having problems at my feet" said the journalists to the mayor of the City, Pep Guardian.
"We talked about playing it 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to sign at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially brought Sky Blues into the struggle for the Premier League.
The gol arrived at 29 minutes.
Aguero received the pillar in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before leading Sterling to the second floor.
Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball in the net shortly before leaving the field.
The City will fight against the Hoffenheim in the champions League tour at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play track against the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from playoff, there was no reason to force another start.
But as the always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which keep an advantage of a game on Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a record with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the maximum level of all this year.
And why should I never want to win?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launch for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, has held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in its normal Sunday of rest.
The Washington launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump a radon in West Virginia
The President made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the influence of republicans on midterm elections.
"All we have done is played in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I really am giving myself to do this for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "We see this terrible group of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using any means necessary, it is possible to see the cathetivity, the machine.
They don't care who can hit, who must interfere to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control and we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have been given the mission of "stop and stop."
"And it's been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "failed, sadistic, machine and bungalow."
He referred to the Commission for the Justice of the Senate with democratic Senator Diane Feinstein on behalf of the Committee, throwing strong fish between the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you break the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I look like a--that was a bad language of the body--the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The laburist party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't torture people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was not a great surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Members of the Labour Parliament to whom it has been reported not to be welcomed, and all because they have said what they thought.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she was opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship has criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy was in agreement with the previous leaders.
The announcement for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour of Friday states that "we would like meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local laburist party, the meetings of Friday evening were exactly like this.
Today, however, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and short-lived" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been remembered.
It has become increasingly evident that different points of view are not tolerated in the laburist party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable or less for the party leadership.
All of this began shortly after Jeremy became the head of the party, and my colleagues whom I had previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect an investment of trend by me and who had taken positions that I would never accept, which was a national security or of the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - I continue to resort to insults on the media that call for my withdrawal, by discontinuing the centre's policy and saying I shouldn't be part of the laburist party.
And it's not just my experience.
I am sure to be more fortunate than my fellow Members, because my direct comments tend to be of a political nature.
I am surprised by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of harassment on a sexist or racist basis every day but who are not left to fear.
One of the most divisive aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of insult.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the laburist party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every reason to challenge or modify the selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years, I have been given many advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my views in this way openly, and everything would be fine.
But it's not to do this that I'm involved in politics.
Since I entered the Laburist party 32 years ago, caused by the government's inquisitiveness that had left my class of secondary school literally to fall to pieces, I tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local counsel or government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be left out in some way frustrated by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is precipitating to a Brexit that will harm the families, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy talking about my loyalty to the head of the laburist party.
But in fact the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, who are members of the laburist or less party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an Immaculate Ayr scale the classification
Two late attempts might have failed the final result in some way, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the triumph in this extremely fun party of the Tennent campaign day.
I'm now on top of the classics, the only team covered by ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, which had pushed the house team and the coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our parties so far and we are still involved, so I must be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "I wish to acknowledge Ayr's merit, they've taken better advantage of our opportunities."
The target of Grant Anderson at 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr to advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, captured by the Warriors for the game, has allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot has acquired an unconverted target.
Climate has increased the distance of the Ayr with a rig before, just half the time, to signal and thus convert a target from just to bring the Ayr to 17-5 to the interval.
But Melrose started well the second time and the target of Patrick Anderson, converted from Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
So there was a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was made to stand, and once again, the Ayr was reassessed in favour thanks to a target of Stafford McDowell converted from Climo.
The Ayr Blair Macpherson's successor, therefore, received a yellow cartel and Melrose paid the man more with an unconverted target of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of great pressure.
The house team is back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cart for a contrast with Airless Air, from the touch of the river, MacPherson signed a touch down behind the mix in advance of Ayr.
Climo turned, as he had done nearly since reopening, after Rowe had collected the calcium from David Armstrong's area and sent Gregor Henry's flanger to search for the fifth target of the house team.
Star of Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company with a license.
The 56th actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which writes and interprets along with the long-term partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that the next nine series would also be the final of the show, and Kiernan seems to be thinking about a life after Craiglang.
Being on official reports lists, he is the Director of Affymorn Limited.
The actor refused to release statements, although a source of Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to involve himself in the "prosperous marketing of the restaurant" of Glasgow."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without breaking into the sea hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
The mariners are painting a general shipyard dressed in sarciame in La Paz.
Public buildings reflect an ocean blue flag.
The bass of ships from Lake Titicaca to the river of the Amazon are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovery is a duty."
In all the Bolivian without breaking down on the sea, the memory of the Persian coast and now in hand to Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as well as the desire to ask the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the slant, a spirit of unity and seriousness and is obviously awaiting the outcome with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Aia court welcomes Bolivia's request that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a failure on the State's sea of competence.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for the elections next year - has a lot to do with the sentence of Monday.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will find it difficult to decide in favor of Bolivia and that it would not change if it did.
The United Nations body, located in the Netherlands, has no power to assign the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice reached just six months after the final proceedings indicated that the case was ‘not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, an international Chilean expert.
And long to advance the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The Belgian rhetoric of Morale has invaded any other good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussions as soon as possible.
The two countries did not exchange Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia to the Aia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly secret.
Monday, Bolivia will be able to "go on an extraordinary opportunity in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end up to 139 years of disputes with mutual advantage", he explained.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political squamour.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not happen without trust in the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his nation would never commit nuclear disarmament if it could first rely on Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to have faith in the promises made during Singapore's summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive at the time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be intended to reopen diplomatic treaties in status after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It is clear that it is an "inlution" that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea in the balance.
Washington is dependent on the release of the declaration without first Pyongyang taking important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a widespread scepticism on the fact that Pyongyang is intended to give up an arsenic that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shoes present the most recent trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion store near you.
If you want to extend your collection of covers or completely block the rays of the sun, do not search further.
The Valentino and Thom Browne stylists have pointed out that they have passed a series of top-level landscapes for their spring-state collection 2019 that have impressed the world of fashion at Paris Fashion Week.
Very few practical hats have angered on Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their exciting creations on the passerella.
The main piece of Valentino was an excavated color cape decorated with a large board similar to a plum that has cut down the heads of the models.
Other supersede accessories included ingiolaid rings, a stragon hat and an anaanas - but they were not designed to have your head in the heat.
Thom Browne has also presented a choice of funny masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks are made up of coconut leaves and look more like a Hannibal Lecter representation than a high suit.
A creation was similar to a complete foraging with masks and glasses, while another seemed like a broken yellow dog.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you're lucky.
The observers of the style predict that the enormous curves could reach you on the roads of high fashion.
The outer hats arrive on the "La Bomba", the sand hat with a bigger roof than a meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The label of worship behind the very little practical hat that has invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the pastel: a large-scale beach bag almost as much as the model in costume as the door.
The pink-colored orange box, refined with smooth in rafia and with a white leather handle, was the strong piece of the spring-state 2019 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
The festival's stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAILs: "I expect these big beach hats and bags to come to the next state's luxury shops, because the stylist has had such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for superior accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent Scottish schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this has been followed in 2018 with another series of excellent results in the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other collective efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools tend to prepare students for higher education, selected careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As the education sector is able to develop and adopt a plan of personalized school studies, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demand within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach him to the brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we wish to create confidence relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's examinations, we can note that languages are above the graduates, with the highest percentages of success within independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages received the maximum votes.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools have shown that 72% of students received the highest vote in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, which will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, as a choice of matter, languages are considered the same level of STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that the reasons why employees have indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more opportunities for work that requires knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically bring a multilingual person to competition.
At a survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in teaching languages is so important for children today.
The knowledge of more languages, in particular those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in taught languages.
Several schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that have been considered the most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages among you to choose in independent schools, with the teacher staff specialized in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this moment, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the country's future, and this must be reflected in the teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with Sunday Lakers in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for fans who expect LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' alleleator Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-commissioned opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it must still be fixed for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the start of the week, James was asked what his plans would be for the program of six pre-commissioned Lakers.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly parties to prepare me," he said.
The moment of the radon a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the beginning of this year in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a raduni branch.
This is the first five rounds for Trump next week, including stopped in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his election to cover the vacant position at the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the next midterm elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in the November elections.
What will Trump's commission now be, and how can you follow it online?
The Tromp commission in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the Tromp commission in West Virginia online by using live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who have become the subject of sexual violence charges with an early confirmation vote of the Senate in custody for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help the Republicans who must face the November elections to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that these five rads during the next week are going to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Members' Senate and House," being in Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so decisive for its programme that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are engaged in the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman of the Trump campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programmed for the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, the tonight's committee could call supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media," being in West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the State in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate to the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to give him an incentive in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University politician, standing in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive until Sundays
After three single sessions, the Thursdays of Saturday may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum motor is a fully invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in a race like these.
So where would the motorcycle be now?
"They had a advantage of six points and now they're four, so I say we're keeping some motorcycles," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, on four points ahead with other twelve in the game.
The Americans feel that they have some wind in favor, as Spieth has said, and they have a lot to hope for, not from the last form of Spieth and Justin Thomas that have played together all day and every three points on four.
Spieth was explained from tea to green and he's giving the example.
The opening watches of the festival became stronger hand than the next game, covering a crucial piece to compare the accounts to the four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His pukt that made them win the game at the 15 balls was picked up with a similar clock, which tells you that he thinks the American team isn't yet out of the race.
"You really have to worry about your party," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players can do now.
18 boots to make a point.
The only players with more Spieth and Thomas points in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible version of Ryder Cup.
The strange but devout couple in Europe are four to four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple to not take a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine o'clock Friday morning.
That way, and the way their energy seems to flow from and towards the chisso people is strengthened by the certainty that they are players to fight on Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest a possible European victory while the sun falls on Le Golf National.
Preferredly both at the same time his different mouth.
However, European discourses of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to meet Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four-ball, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double boots on the first nine boots have put the Spanish and Swedish into a mouth from which they have not even been able to lift long enough.
However, Sunday there's no one to help you get out of your mouth.
The furballs and fursomes are so fascinating to observe from close by means of interactions between couples, advice that is harmful and not harmful and how the strategy can change at any time.
Europe played better as a team so far and gained an important advantage on the final day, but this forum session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, something that some, particularly the states, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 advantage on the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage on the final day of Ryder Cup after having completed the football games and Saturdays with a 10-6 advantage on the United States.
The inspired couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victorys on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score up to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to preserve the trophie lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning's suburbs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has largely resisted in the forums, winning two parties, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 parties each Sunday to save the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first European exorcist to win four row points while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensitive weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four opening points in the history of Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed at the Fourballs, they worked in a great way to beat down a Woods and the American escort Bryson Dechambeau with another cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who crossed for two Sabbath parties, showed occasional spracies of generosity but lost 19 of his 29 parties in the Fourballs and Forsoms and seven rows.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning's fourballs, returned to the side of Henrik Stenson's partner in the forums to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's classics.
However, Europe has not achieved all the expected results in a pleasant and windy day in southern Paris.
The three great winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for the Americans with two Saturday points.
They won a great victory 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the Fourballs and returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the Forsosome, losing the two opening boxes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point score, passing to each other, although it is a title, the Furyk team needs only a couple to defend the trophie.
After being the second best for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea has turned its back on unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea has told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions was countering the country's challenge in the United States, which would have been totally refused to give up on its nuclear weapons alone in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced on the occasion of the General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea has adopted "important measures of good will" over the past year, such as the halt to nuclear and Missile Tests, the decommissioning of the nuclear test site and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any answers according to the United States," he said.
"With no confidence in the United States, there will be no security in our national security, and in these circumstances we refuse to give up unanimity for the first time."
Although Ri has re-used the complainant's comments on Washington's resistance to a "in-fasi" denuclearization with which North Korea would be awarded on the basis of gradual actions, its statement was important because it has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards the "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal agreement with the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington was also opposed to appeals for the strict international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The United States insists on the need to "have a denuclearization first" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions in order to achieve their objective in a coherent manner and to oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us in trouble is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our challenge."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader announced to the United States at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the contrary of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's denuclearization would not be at this point of death."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's United Nations General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to point out the US territory with North Korea's missions after "the President of the Evil" had called Kim a "missile man" committed in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, he re-enacted Kim for her courage in pursuing the path of disarmament, but said that there must be much more to be done and that sanctions will remain until North Korea's denuclearization.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying that "if we want two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "the respect for the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with and without exceptions until full, final and certified decolonization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's control sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to focus on the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompoo met Ri at the end of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip is not going well.
He was separated from Pyongyang in July by saying that they had been made progress, but a few hours after North Korea he accused him of having submitted "gangster requests."
North Korea was committed during a meeting this month with Moon to shut down a Missile Site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "compliant measures."
He said Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump was committed in Singapore and actions aimed at normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to relax enough
A new course at Harvard University this year urged all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing culture of learning for whole nights consumed by caffeine.
A university student noted that university students number one in the world often have no idea of basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first of these in the United States.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given effect to the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came from me and said to me, 'Why is this only now, when I am last year?'
He said that no one had ever said anything about the importance of the dream, which I was really surprised," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, learned for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential concepts of how good sound habits can help academic and athletic performances, as well as improve general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director-general of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a strong sleep shortage during the week.
The course of an hour provides for a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can choose coffee, tea, ginnatic shoes and books to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by the lack of sleep, and the importance of a serene routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, ictus, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice of cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride related to the "white night to study", there is still, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to the lack of sound to be a continuing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a sound of good quality should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, gravitationality, anxiety, it has explained and added should serve to avoid increasing as the lack of sound brings the brain in the form of a nose, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who wrote to the chemical and physical biology college, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year in Harvard during his first year.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course around the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all students to follow a similar study program before writing to this competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a watch for when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send the circuital rhythm in a titut, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol under Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another depressive attack from outside the house with Dolly Menga's gol that belonged to Steven Gerrard's disarmed team at a 1-0 hit in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox was looking for the first victory outside the house from the triumph of 4-1 February in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerrard's second scoundrel in 18 parties leaving his team at eight points from the leaders fleeing the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga has signed seven minutes before the interval and a short-saving training of Rangers is never seem to be able to compare.
While the Ranger now descends to the sixth place, Livingston descends to the third, and only back to the Hibernian for a difference of gol.
And there could be further problems arriving for the Rangers after the Calum Spence guard was healed for a head injury due to an object apparently fired from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly exceeded Ayr in the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, has chosen the usual training that has hit a point on Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team has focused its opponents on every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated for the possession of the ball, but Livingston has made better use of the balls available to him.
They could have indicated just two minutes later when Menga's first filter pass had sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's door, but the central champion broke the opportunity.
A stone of punishment in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense friend Alan Lithgow was able only to pull on the second floor.
The Rangers took control of us, but it seems to be more hope than confidence in their game in areas of trouble.
Alfredo Morelos certainly considered it necessary to see a rise in the fifteenth after a meeting with Steven Lawless, but Archbishop Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the first time, but the former Ibrox Liam Kelly's porter was not allowed to worry about the head beat of Lassana Coulibaly and a white shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening gol at 34 minutes may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he has earned it just for his commitment.
Once again the Rangers has failed to manage a piece of silver in Jacobs' depth.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard activated during the interval by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an impact almost immediately since the hall had a wall in place in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly was hit by the door line to block it.
But Livingston has continued to track visitors exactly in the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halket who picked up a long ball after the other.
Holt's team may have increased the distinction in the final stages, but McGregor was opposed to closing Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton has submitted a final request for strength after a break with Jacobs but Thomson has rejected it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our German "Sday Morning" page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and CONTEGGIO continues... the day when the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger contactor.
A firm point of science without then, Geiger's contactor has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those little cowlboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these auriculars, you can really feel the effects of atoms released from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans, "There's a bit going on right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the ill cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the ill cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malaise cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, and their modification in the laboratory.
So they can "see" a common protein with many types of tumors and then they are resuscitated
A experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who is treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malaise cells has seen her cancer disappear in the eggs for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their laboratory modification so that they can "see" a common protein with many types of cancer, called HER2, and so these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States with headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promotions the growth of various types of tumors", including that in the brain, the eggs, the lungs and the colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "instruct" them as to attack the tumor cells has been used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West runs into a pro-Trump diaphragm wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) Berret (make America Great Again) after its appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was filmed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live score after a closed performance during which he commended US President Donald Trump and said he would have applied in 2020.
After he interpreted his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a mild MAGA, he started a campaign against the Democrats and withdrew his support in Trump.
"I talk to white people many times and they say, "How you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I'm worried about racism, I'd have gone from America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene that the protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood's star took note of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Commission against the charges of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not transmitted, the registration of the Philippines in West was loaded on the social media by comic Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock himself is trying to take over West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad time in the backstage because of his cover.
"They've bullied me in the backstage.
They said to me, 'Don't go out with that brat.'
I've been bluffed!
And then they told me I'm a marginal" he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the summer place?" and he said "I'll wear the Superman handle because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
His comments have generated at least twice from the public, and the members of the SNL castle seem to be confused, said Variety, with a person who told the newspaper: "The only study is a mortal silence."
West was invited as a substitute for the last minute of the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-confidential, rapper Mac Miller was dead a few days ago.
West has mixed many with a performance of the song I Love it, passed by Perrier's bottle.
West has received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for putting a test on the MASSA."
But the show driver Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what is and this is just wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who I think is wearing a vogue ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
It's not about the first artist to change his name and is following Didy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friend rapper, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend undiscovered Prince, who had changed his name in a symbol and so in the artist previously known as Prince.
Allegedly attempted murder for accommodation in a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was gathered at a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident was checked in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused will have to appear at Belfast Monday's award.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Service.
The star of Spade Kit Harington's Throne attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as combatant Jon Snow in the violent series of fantasy medieval Trono of Spade.
But the 31st actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such floorings on the screen are often believed to young people that they should be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said to think that "something has been stored" and reflected on how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married with the co-star of Trono di Spade, 31 years old, has allowed herself to worry a lot about this problem.
'I personally care, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we now observe?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely male character.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, what makes children think they should be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause of course something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview, he also admitted that he would not interpret any prequal or sequence of Trono di Spade once the series ended the next state, saying that "has ended with fields of battle and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will interpret the main role in the life of True West Sam Shepard, the history of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a rapinator.
The actor recently revealed that he considered the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing happened with Trono di Spade.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," he explained.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the winning fantasy series of Emmys.
The couple married in June 2018 in the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China refers to an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these pathology, according to sources of health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have already been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change in the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has been spreading in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, as the health authorities have stated during a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was defined in China, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sexual relations with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to the management of the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has made the data from the GOP senators, and speaks of "hazardous buggies" and "cospiration theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. Member has denounced charges to a member of his staff concerning the publication of personal information by three United States senators in the pages of Wikipedia of the legislators.
The democratic representative of Los Angeles stated that the statements were promoted by opinionists and websites of the "ala of ultra-left".
"Bugie, buggy and still disgusting bugs" said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The information published would include home addresses and phone numbers of United States senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, released by an anonymity of the Campidoglio during a hearing of an expert commission on sexual violence charges against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news flight occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts has been associated with the Waters office and have provided information about a member of the Waters staff.
"This infodata accused is completely false and an absolute fool," said Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been brought to mind as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has not been in any way responsible for avoiding such information.
This charged charge is completely false and absolutely foolish."
Waters' claim has quickly generated online criticism from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This silence is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This means you don't have a character to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
It shouldn't be provocative.
The reasons of the accused must not be questioned.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate who is currently publishing to destroy Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enorm is confirmed," she tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities and the forces of the order of these trends.
"We will do so that the responsible ones will be missed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all my staff."
Johnny's English Review Still Hits - The Parody of the Spie With a Rowan Atkinson
It has now been used to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this review of Johnny English's action comedy, started in 2003 and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The rebirth.
How many ships do we make will be the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and the eyes out of the orbits obtained his license to tear things out for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything about a chemical creation developed for countries of non-englophone film producers.
Of course, it is the secret agent who, despite his strange pretenses of glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pizza of that type that has contributed with a unique note at the time of Gloria of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
It is a character originally based on a mysterious international traveler and man who once interpreted atkinson's forgotten television ads by Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last issue of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medium-arm and the horses quickly swirled against his helmet.
The gift of Atkinson for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor seems to be quite subtle and extremely superfluous, especially now that film brands "seri" like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer the committee as an ingredient.
The humor seems direct to children rather than to adults and for me, the Pazzish discrepancies of Johnny English are not as original and viewed as the gaggs of Atkinson's movies when he interprets Mr. Bean.
The premise of real estate is now the fact that Great Britain is seriously dangerous.
A computer hacker has been infiltrated in the supersecret internet of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, with the involvement of the charged agent, a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the gosh who works the vase for a first budgeted and tortured minister, who is already suffering a piece of political instability: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this character like Teresa May, but there is not much on which to work in the copy.
His intelligence consultants inform him that each active shoulder has been compromised and that someone who has already gone to retirement should be called.
And this means that the evil Johnny English, who now works as school director in a chic facility, but who also participates in official lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some good gag, when English offers a type of school of Rock spy course.
English is renewed in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, once again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role of the girl of the high society where Vicki Pepperdine is a little crushed.
So Batman and Robin of the deserts for His Majesty's secret services are again in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the first minister is in danger of falling into the network of the billions of charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain: the left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their dream of ridiculous adventures: transpped by cameras, they fire in a French restaurant; they escape the hell by clancingly entering into Volta's luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take a demesity with the house of Volta.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as stolen and exhausted, there's a bit of TV for children throughout the story.
Everything's pretty modest.
And how did it happen with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: the British cinematographic industry couldn't assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent?
The Laburista party refuses to be developing a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's laburist party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, just being paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, maintaining the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with the plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day day was marked by the union convention as a way for workers to benefit from the evolution economy.
An senior member of the laburist party said to The Sunday Times: "At the end of the year, the announcement of a revision of the political line is being made."
"It won't happen one day to the other, but one working week of four days is an online appeal with the party's approach to the rebalancement of the economy for the workers, as well as its industrial strategy together."
The Laburista Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week within the general electoral campaign of 2017.
In any case, this aspirations do not please the time of the Laburista Party's unanimous support.
A spokesman from the Laburista Party said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is not currently under discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the labyrinth conference last week to give particular attention to a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power from "unforeseen managers" and "expectors" in public services companies.
The plans of the scandal scandal also include that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the lab government could implement "deductions" on the basis of illegal behaviour.
It has also confirmed the plans to include employees in business management councils and to create inclusive participation funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of the net equity of private-sector enterprises to employees, which end with annual dividends up to 500€.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation in the context of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has sent the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises doubts as to whether the findings of the government agency can influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will take place on Sunday afternoon, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it is possible that the FBI can bring something to light in order to change the idea.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it while I was listening, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after he had succeeded, who had come out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, inequitable."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be stuck in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and could resist a bomb test case," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one has been able to prove her names.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything again in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This New York Saturday will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable carrolled star and has a equally exciting mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people reversing on the Great Law of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, which will end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless it was willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public of the concert had to carry out a series of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary, email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other significant way to raise awareness about their purpose of eliminating poverty.
But, of course, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now remained 12 years to achieve its intended goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a fine way to persuade people to ask for a call for action, or is it just another example of the so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they really do the difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters, who are working for a variety of purposes.
It states that these actions have contributed to calling for global leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, aimed at influencing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads that have already been cancelled or used as funds at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds for protected capital have so far had a direct impact on around 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives with headquarters in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow to the greatest of their potential," with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and the Global Citizen just like you, we can make it possible that social injustice or malnutrition become a note on the page in the history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions were implemented called on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the launch of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through food interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and long way - sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartment movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of those who will be shown this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Marine to implement "a block" and stop Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can, "if necessary", make use of its Marine to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke noted that the Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for which they find themselves in the Middle East lies in the fact that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern follicle of Europe," he said.
And, according to the staff, there are ways and means to get ahead.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Marine, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a shiplock, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the agreements hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that I am, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make financial levies and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas in Europe, and to replace Russia, an option which is absolutely the most economic for European consumers.
To that end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2, a "inappropriate" gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin "primary" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that Nord Stream 2, spent at 11 billion dollars, designed to double the capacity of that existing up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a mere economic project.
The Cremlin object is that Washington's persistent opposition to the project is simply guided by economic reasons and is an example of free competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers," said the Minister of Energy, Mr Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The U.S. position has been delayed by the negative reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry's focus organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to remain outside the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see it as a big problem that a third State interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take "in serious consideration" to apply to the presidency in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that he would take "a serious consideration" of being president after the election of half-manded.
In the course of a civil assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the possibility of applying.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and put our government in place, and that means having a woman at the summit," he said, as The Hill reports.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my president's request."
During the civil assembly Warren said his address to President Donald Trump, saying he was " bringing this country into the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explained in his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by him to the Supreme Court.
Friday Warren wrote on a tweet: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's same voters do not think they should apply in 2020.
58 per cent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not compete, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
The 32 per cent supported such a candidate.
The survey has shown greater support for a candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in support of a potential candidate and 48 per cent in contrast.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed on a potential candidate in 2020 include former President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would take an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's rad
Track Palin, 26 years old, has spent a year in Iraq after being kidnapped in September
He was arrested and charged for a domestic violence on Monday night
"What is going on, my son, what is going on after being returned, I can put it in relation to other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning," said the audience to a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, tired, asking whether there is respect for which their soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, are devoted to the country."
It was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic aggression and violence against a woman, who interferes with a report on domestic violence and possession of firearms under the marvels, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Police Department of Vasilla.
18 Columbia States and the District Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Twenty States and the Columbia District support a legal battle against a new policy of the United States that rejects asylum to refugees from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the Columbia District of Friday presented a friendly memory in Washington to support an asylum-seekers responding to this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the call Grace v. Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that his partner "and his violent sons in the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
He was put in a standstill in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations facing tremendous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has violated a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to submit an asylum application to immigrants who have fled from domestic violence.
Friday, the Attorney-General of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law imposes that all asylum applications are judged on the basis of specific circumstances and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle," says the memory of friends curiae.
In the memory, the prosecutors have also pointed out that the policy that limits immigrants' income to income damages the US economy, affirming the net likelihood that these become entrepreneurs and "give necessary work".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration not to guarantee asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fear due to racial, religious, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for a political opinion," said Sessions on 11 June, in the context of the announcement of the political line.
The asylum has never been designed to overcome any problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people must face every day around the world.
Experimental attempts to recover in Palu while the balance of the deaths in the race to find survivors
For superstitions, the situation was becoming more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said Risa Kusuma's 35th mother, while she strengthened her little febrilling baby in an evacuation center in the destructive city of Palu.
"At any moment there's an ambulance that takes the bodies.
Clean water drains."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, putting their weak personal effects among them, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people and hospitals, injured by magnitude 7.5, were injured.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, who was victims of a fractured back and forth, were recovered outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were cured abroad because of the constant sharpness of the attack.
His eyes filled with tears as he caught the feeling from the violent earthquake that wiped out the room he shared with his wife and daughter at the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I've been beaten up between the walls, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife screaming to ask for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "prepotence" with "public propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a publication of four pages on a U.S. daily, publishing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to advertise.
The United States last Wednesday, President Donald Trump made a reference to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the day with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States Congress elections on November 6, a complaint that China is relegated.
The accused by Trump, concerning the fact that Pechino was trying to immigrate in the US elections, noted that U.S. officials referred to Reuters to be a new phase of a scale-up campaign to work in Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish to promote trade, Pechino and Washington are currently involved in a trade war in scalation that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
The Chinese recovery duties at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to attack exporters in States such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, as the Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Pechino had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now increases those assumptions by publishing public propaganda on our free journals."
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government is serving the love American tradition of freedom of speech and of print, putting a publicity to pay in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"Viceversa, on the street corner here in Beijing you will find dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the dissuasive opinions that the Chinese people might have on China's economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's greatest daily signs has elucidated the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say that journals are being dealt with.
The Republicans are aligning the female electorate before the mid-commanded elections with the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
Since many of the republics at the point defend the name of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are on its side in dealing with various cases of sexual harassment, analysts have noted that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the future elections of half-manded.
The attitude in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially demonstrated their willingness to continue with a vote.
"You can't recall these things," said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher has expressed doubts that the strength of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to place the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said the Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior and national spokesman of the progressive moveOn group.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate room, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission decided to continue with Kavanaugh's application despite the testimony of Dr.sa Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already high; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the young electors and the young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote even though they don't salute the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment charges against the candidate to the Supreme Court, the analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could be verified if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"For the GOP has become a total confusion," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote for the committee, the final one, or whether Kavanaugh will be placed in the panel, it is also about how the Republicans have managed the situation and the way they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be in some way divided between the person to whom they believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a less percentage in favour of this last one.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the interviewees have certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to have certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably lied or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insinuation, the FBI is currently conducting investigations on the charges brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accused, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
The last week Ford witnessed under oath, in the Senate's judicial committee, that Kavanaugh killed him in a state of Hebrews when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court has married his genitals during a party during the studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor designed to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, is launching a startup that is trying to revaluate with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee warned that the attempt behind Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online personal data store or a POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely the choice of the user who can have access to any type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make it possible to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff responsible for working on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers from all over the world will be able to give life to their decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not say "Facebook and Google if you enter or not a complete change where their business models are completely lacking from one day to the other.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to seek commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to protecting the integrity and quality of the new website built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even after Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Remembered the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Ecclesiastical Church of England to be awarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in its birth city after 100 years.
The lieutenant Colonel, Reverno Bernard Vann, received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a shell and he never knew he had attained the highest level of British military honour.
On Saturday in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two Nipots opened a memorial lamp.
One of his Nipots, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" the fact that the stone would have been opened at exactly 100 years of the premium of its grandmother.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battle in addition to the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a great cloud under the heavy fire of the camp and the war machine".
Then he struggled to the fire line and with the "greatest gallantry" he progressed the line before running with a single-hand cannon and landed three of the distance.
The local Colonel Vann was killed by a German shell on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know can never be taller and something that makes it more humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also had a crown of flowers after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt truly honored to find a role in the parade" and added "the value of a real hero is shown by the support that he will receive from many people."
The MMA fans have been on their feet all night looking at Bellator 206, and instead they have been beaten by Peppa Pig.
Imagine a bit, you've been awake all night to see the famous Bellator 206 just to see you reject the view of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 battles, including the six on the hand card, and had to be transferred to the United Kingdom during the night, directly on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to stand up, TV viewers in the United Kingdom were left out of shock when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some are based after being left awake until the first hours of the morning for the fight.
On Twitter a fan described the passage to an animated cardboard for children as "a kind of cute touch screen".
"The government regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so it was necessary to pass on to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked for the transmission.
"Pappa the maela," "Yes."
"The president of Bellator's company, Scott Cooker, said that they will work on programming to include future United Kingdom TV viewers.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But there are six Sunday mornings and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our hourly fuss, Monday for them.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights rather than six - as we normally do - and we have tried to get so much for the fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexuality
Olympic poet Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24th said not to be taken into account until he arrived at secondary school, because "not all are like me".
Speaking at the first point in the Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had heard his own voice about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent has made him less likely to win the Olympics.
The representative of the old date program, Kirsty Young, has taken a series of free months for disease.
In presenting himself as a marginalist in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "he was not socially acceptable the fact that he liked both the boys and the girls."
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and of being different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to try to be "something," he said, in order not to deduce anyone if he had found out about his sexuality.
The second time a bronze medal for the Olympics has become an actor of the LGBT high profile and has used his face in the Australian Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he had heard his voice because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time World Championship said that the fact of being a man - U.S. director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than he, last year, but said that the difference of age was never a problem.
"When I was so young," he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find any of the same age who had experienced similar high and low.
The two have become parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about the fact that "I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know one thing, there's more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he said was if he already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him 'you won't be from these parts to be in the first row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually died, I didn't realize it was inviolable," he said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I knew it was just what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a public house in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him the skin of the eye.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside shape of Mikkelson put in pancakes in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will present a Sunday record when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to go back in order to avoid becoming an unhappy billionaire stone.
Mickelson, playing in the casual event for a twelve-time record, was placed in a pancake by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and the Saturday's Foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of action, as was often for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day doing the cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what tortures him.
Being never the strongest driver even at the top of his career, 48th year is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the dark path regularly imposes wrong crimes.
And if the journey of himself was not encouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday match, is facing the exact sample of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all and four of their match this week.
If the Americans, of four points at the beginning of their 12 single matches, are born with a remarkable beginning, the match of Mickelson could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he gave me a package on my back, he put a arm around me and he said he would be ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the team last week.
I probably didn't imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way he went, and this is the way we thought he should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson Sunday will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of games played in Ryder Cup.
It could indicate the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never even long respected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games, 20 seats and seven pairs, even if Furyk has said that his presence has brought immense goods to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, angry, people like to play games, and it's a fantastic boy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players have been fun to complain against him this week, something that has been fun to look at.
He did much more than play."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a convenient resort.
The Danish started in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama in which the team, headed by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point distinction from the Americans, arrived at the track line with a minimum advantage, winning 141⁄2-131/2.
"Continued to remind me that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderrama where we won, but rarely," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, on Friday for 5 to 3 and on Friday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"Because it will be the story to prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow you have to give the maximum.
We need to go out there and do everything in the right way.
It is not finished until the points are not marked in the washing.
Our goal is to try to win the trophie, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players in my team, but I know well who is on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy of the way his men hired in that difficult golf field, Bjorn added: "I'll never be overcome.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performance, which is another thing.
It's nice to meet a teammate there when things go well, but when you're just your golfer skills are put to the test.
This is the message you have to send to the players: tomorrow, you must throw out the best of you.
Then, forget about your friend because he also has to go there and throw out the best of himself."
On the contrary of Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will seek in his players the best individual performance of the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both sides in those major meetings on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing the European "Miracola di Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, conducted his players in mind on the last day.
"We have 12 important parties tomorrow, but we want to start immediately with the right foot as we did in Brooklyn and in Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain piece, the pressure increases in the middle party.
That is why we organize our training of consequence and classify the kids in the way they seem appropriate to us, because tomorrow we will seek to do a miracle.
Thomas was assigned to lead the controversial and face Rory McIllroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new German military ship was repatriated
According to the local media, the last frigate of the German military Navy would have to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships in the days of the Cold War, but it will not be until next year because of defective systems and a cost commitment.
The Commission of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the Ammigralia ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, was posted until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentions a military carrier.
The ship would have had to join the military Marine in 2014, but concern over the issues that followed the delivery had tortured the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Military Marine in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of ancient and anti-naive missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer periods of maintenance, which should be possible to use new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continued delay implies that innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to plan its own power further, will become obsolete once they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The luckily frozen Type F-125 made news last year, when the German military Navy officially refused to commission the ship and restored it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Amburg.
It was the first time the military Navy restored a ship to the builder after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware" that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be managed by a crew of about 120 marines, just half of the staff of the oldest Bremen class ships.
In addition, it is emerging that the ship weighs too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the possibility of the military Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tonnes, is twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including equipment training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) from the first EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent warnings regarding the reduction of German shippower.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy was actually "loading ships capable of being used".
The official said that the issue was significantly worse over time, since the old disarmed ships were not replaced by new ships.
Its framework is that none of the bats of the Baden-Württemberg class have been able to join the military Navy.
The National Trust Saves the Secret Life of Pipistrells
New research carried out in a container of the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the Pipistrells use the view to search for food.
It is confident that the discoveries can shed light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and suprano pipelines, in addition to the brown ears and the Daubenton pipelines at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special registries will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the pipelines during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile tests using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of the requests of the pipettes and the manner in which each species is treated.
They will then produce a map of the habitat and a report to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the protection of the nature of the NTS, hopes that the results can reveal which habitat areas are most important for the pipelines and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as plant creation, and how to keep the forests in good condition for pipelines and other related species.
The population of pipelines in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the past century.
Pipistrells are at risk for construction and development works that interest tropical and rob habitats.
Elegant turbines and lighting can also constitute a threat, as well as the mosquid paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, in addition to the attacks of domestic cats.
Pipistreles aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to holding a stick.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to identify insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes the pillars very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the truffles, and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation has even established the first reserve of Scotland for only the Pipistrells at Threave, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of the ten species of Pipistrells in Scotland.
The holder's responsibility, David Thompson, states that property is the ideal territory.
"Who in Thrave we have a vast area for the pipistrells," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot on the pipelines we don't know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
It underlines the importance of controlling the pipelines before driving the maintenance inside the property as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother trolley can kill up to 400 women and young people, perhaps spreading through a whole local population.
Pipistreles are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, destroy them or destroy their trailers.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish leader for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our pirates and for many of our species we don't know how to feed their people."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape while the legal cause of the German weekly
Christian Ronaldo has labeled the charges of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "will make themselves public" with his name.
His laws are prepared to cause the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of violence against an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also made a note on Friday about the payment of $375.000 to maintain silence on the event.
In a video on Instagram directly to its 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33 years old, broke out the statements as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the fifth time Pallene d'Oro turning to the video camera.
"They want to make themselves public through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the smiling calcator.
According to the Reuters, Ronaldo's laws are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for charges, defined as "an unacceptable notification of suspects on the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the calcier will ask for recovery for "moral damage in the measure corresponding to the severity of the violation of privacy, considered probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years".
The fact would have taken place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would be brought back to the calcator's room, where he was subjected to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maorga claims that Ronaldo would have been put in a coma after the incident saying that it was for "99 percent" a "brown boy" deduced from "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this was a consensus.
Mayorga also said that she was taken to police and hospitals, where her injuries were photographed, but that she subsequently consented to a reconciliation agreement because she felt "terrorized by the tortures" and worried about the prospect of "publicly being humiliated".
The 34th is now seeking to break the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this state will join the Italian Juventus with a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will always eliminate the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom could "keep the loss of its world leader in the construction of cars after Brexit, said the Minister of Industry Greg Clark.
He added that he was "interested" for the declarations made by Toyota UK to the BBC regarding the possible exit of Great Britain from the EU without an agreement and the resulting immediate block of production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automotive house claims that delays in frontiers, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston factory, in which the Toyota Auris and Avenues are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain comes out of the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It increases the concern of the other English car manufacturers for EU exit without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain experienced by the constructioners in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the concept of "just in time" with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from English and European suppliers for vehicles on schedule.
If the United Kingdom will leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be discrepancies at the borders that would cause delays and lack of partholding.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of value of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, he declared the company, so the production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "expected precisely to avoid these barriers to borders".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but also to take this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4.
"The test, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a chain of distribution of great success."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production could stop, but for a long time it warned that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of the facilities and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the manager of the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are deeply concerned: "In my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
The meeting of Trump with Rosenstein could be withdrawn yet, says the White House.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "retracted for a week", while continuing the debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who points out the Russian interferences with the elections, the links between the Councils of Trump and Russia, and the possible obstacle to the justice of the president.
The possibility that Trump could license the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fed Washington's guest for months.
In the course of the month, the New York Times mentioned that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a chemistry to record the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and voted himself to leave.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced on Wednesday, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I wouldn't" license Rosenstein, but then the meeting was sent to avoid a sit-down with the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
Friday, Trump ordered a week of instruction of the FBI's questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
Dominica, the porter of Trump, Sarah Sanders, is compared to Fox News.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not been established a date, it may be this week, I imagine you will remain for another week considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll continue to update the press."
Some journalists might answer this statement: Sanders has no briefing with the press at the White House since September 10.
Driver Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said that the shortage of writing was not due to a revision for television journalists "which they put into show", although he said, "I didn't break up with the fact that they put themselves in show".
So he thought the direct contact between Trump and the print might be more frequent.
"The president has more sessions of Question and answers than any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better to talk to me.
We're trying to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or conferences with the visiting delegates.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown us the reason, giving a free speech, and at the same time smiling, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the Scottish NHS workers to express their concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and urge them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the EU's entry into force.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of sedated status requirements for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "For all summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will take the decisions of the autumn.
But the British Government was also prepared for a scenario without agreement.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU, and not only provide valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was operating immediately after a head injury
The Tennissee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in the Sabbath against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31 to 27, as Mike Organ of The Tennesean daily.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told journalists that the incident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He was approached to the bordocampo and he was taken," said Reed.
The first-aid staff and medical personnel have been given to Abercrombie of the oxygen in the camp before placing it in the barrel and taking it for further clarifications.
A director of Tennessee State referred to Chris Harris of the WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has performed a surgical operation at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there has not yet been news about the type and entity of damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to figure out when they were wounded.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year, is at his first season with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He had performed a total of five pitches before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 pitches.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new wages plans.
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in inflation will apply to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of the Interior plans to collect up to 120 million sterline per year to help orphans
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, theresa May will be announced today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide affordable accommodation and higher incomes.
The increase in inflation will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the Government's initiative to combat unemployment.
The ceiling, which is added to the current set of balls, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the properties of buy to lets (compared to rent), could be more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Interior provides that manoeuvre can collect up to 120 million stars a year.
A 13% estimate of new buildings in London is purchased by non-resident citizens in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for purchasers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "funtama city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the State.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a cut on the bill to help the younger ones with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the major construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by acquiring land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up the rates of affordable housing to set up the British real estate deficit.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of exciting proposals for reform of the housing market, including controls on rents and the elimination of offences without blame.
It also wants to give the Council greater powers to build new property.
First Minister May said: "I said last year that I would be committed to restoring the British dream, and that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British resident workers.
For so many people the dream of having a house has become too far and the dignity of the unsatisfied remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to lead Scotland"
The Technical Director of the Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "great ambition" is that of becoming a Scotia manager before or after.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted to the challenge of resolving the North-east team that is currently located at the third place in League One, three points from the battle.
It was approved at the Stadium of Light after being led by St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership of the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a hairdresser.
I've been in series B and that's all," Ross said to the BBC Scottish Sports Sound program.
I've grown up looking at the Scotia at Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will be possible only if I have succeeded as a team manager."
The presidents of Ross at the Sunderland leadership were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician claims to feel no concern in following such important names, in a very important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this time is measured with the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back."
The start of Ross's career is three years ago, after a period of time as a trainer's assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute Hearts trainer.
He then helped the Alloa to escape from the retreat to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the time of the retreat to the champions of the Championship, the following season.
Ross maintains that he feels much more about his actions now than during his career as a hairdresser in the Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"It is probably a real point of action," recalls the Lord's direction.
"I really believe that the manager's role was adapted to me, more than that of the player.
It seems strange because I worked well, I've got to live and I've had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
They still face stress and pressure at work, but management seems good.
I always wanted to run and now I do, I feel much calmer than I've ever been."

According to a study, the right time for a painting is 17:30 a.m. Saturday
The summer summer heat wave has brought more pressure on English pubs in difficulty and more concern for restaurant services.
The data show that pub and bar saw an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, while the interest rate of restaurants was 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA commercial consultancy company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England to the World has made it possible that the month of July followed a similar path as that of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit more severely.
The crowd of 1.8 per cent in June's restaurant is worse in July.
The pubs and bars in which they drank were the most solid, with an increased homogeneity above the taste of the restaurants.
Even the pubs in which they ate suffered the heat, though not as extreme as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out and drink something.
In the pubs and bar handles, the sales of drinks are out of 6.6 per cent a month, while the consumption of food is up to three per cent".
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreational and recreational sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The average and impact of major social or sports events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, despite a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly severe in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have reached a worse period for restaurants and only time can say if the most moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary departure."
The overall increase in sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fall of the brand roll-out.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales company for the pubs, bars and British restaurants combines and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined factor of more than 9 billion stars, and it is the sector's reference company.
A child on five has a secret account of social networks that conceals parents
A survey reveals that a five-year-old, some 11-year-old, has the secret accounts of social networks that cover parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "fake on Instagram" pages
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual background is posted
The 20 percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show parents.
A child on five, some only 11 years old, creates an account of social networks that is hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the "fake on Instagram" account, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual background is posted.
Twenty percent of students have claimed to manage a "primary" account that shows parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who found out about her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who urged others to "trap me".
The research, of the Digital Avarenss UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of private schools has shown that 40 percent of the children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have allowed to keep private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan stated: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eliidh Doyle was elected an executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the national general assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most beautiful Scottish athlete of the light athletic, and President Ian Beattie described the name as a great opportunity for those who manage sport to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elidhi enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland athletics could bring great advantage to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I don't see the time to act as a voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, a winner of 200 and 400 metres to the Games in Atlanta in 1996 and four Olympic Gold Medaglie, as well as currently an opinionist of the BBC, was unable to follow after a transitional chemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a tictus.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would have been able to tell me if I would be arrested and in what extent.
It was an exciting job, but I got caught up in everything, he learned to walk again, and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!".
The advertising of a tirallette compares mothers and babies and divides the opinion online
A producer company of a thiralate has divided the opinion online with a publication that compares mothers who are raised and boys who go up.
To mark the launch of what is defined as "the world's first silent and indisputable trailer", Elvie's consumer technology company launched a publication in the form of a music video screen to show freedom of expression as mothers from the new trailer.
Four real mothers dance in a bunch of pigs on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I take the milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I didn't notice, these are not moms but my aunts."
The choir continues: "Take him out, throw him out, bring him out to the children, throw him out, throw him out, throw him out to my lord."
However, the publication, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has raised different reactions among viewers, many of which have supported the "darks" of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision to use the machetes to publish the product.
Like us, they also need to remain strong and partner to produce milk, except for the fact that their little ones are stolen from their birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie trainer wears discrepancy under a rule for mother
Someone else commented: "Frequently traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them to publish a mother-in-law that will continue to keep their children?"
Someone else added: "It's really a meaningless advertising."
Others have defenses and a woman even allowed to find the "funful" arm.
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still waiting, I'd like to have one.
When I used the trigger, I felt like a mouse.
Publicity is a little ridiculous, but it doesn't go very far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun publication dedicated to mothers who use the tirlate (often at work or in bathroom) and feel like "much."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the household industry."
In the end, video protagonists show that they have balked with the discreet tape inserted in the registrant.
The concept that the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the tract feel like cats.
However, Elvie is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and it can be inserted into a grid by giving women the freedom of movement, holding the children in hand and even getting out while they take the milk.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and ECD commented: "The Elvie Tiralette is such a revolutionary product that deserved an audacity and provocation.
Comparing the women who use breast-feeding we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a very interesting and easily-recognisable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast-feeding is able to ensure."
This is not the first time that the tyrant Elvie made news.
During the week of London's fashion, the mother of two children presented herself on the walkway of the stylist Martha Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved into a tentopolis at the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively invariable, partly because the retroactive and policy line of the Trump administration has made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who took them in trust were like foreigners, who are now afraid to reflect on the possibility of remaining in the country offering to undertake such a gesture.
The risk is increased in June when federal authorities announced that reliable potential and other adult members of their families would have been taken into account and that data would have been transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Force, announced before the Congress that the agency arrested 10 people who had been offered to take the trust of children alone.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no previous penalties.
"Some 80% of the people who offer to take children in trust or belong to the families of these people are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminals.
So we're still giving the dog to these people," said Albence.
In order to try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules for which some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the farm, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, as it says those who work at reception points.
Many will be compared to videoconference rather than person, in order to break their cause of legal status at a court for immigration.
Those who will be considered unworthy to receive assistance will be released soon.
The longer the children remain in trust, the more they are at risk of suffering anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of rabies or refugee attempts, the more they claim those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the probability of this is even higher in a large structure than that of Tornillo in which, because of its size, it is easier to ignore the signs of child abuse.
They add that moving children to the tents without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria aims at the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war has now reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also recovers the charge of prime minister, said that foreign forces are taking over the Syrian soil illegally with the intention of combating terrorism and "will be treated as a consequence".
"They must withdraw immediately without any condition," he said before the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any foreign illegal presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support the Kurd forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the refugee problem, Moulalem stated that the conditions are favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "indicting indiscriminate fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should be just a humanitarian problem is political."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for reconstruction will not be granted in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition will be reached that allows for the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of an area bound by Idlib, the most important rocking force of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political treaties.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "precious deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action was aimed at the Jihadists, including the fighters from the Front al-Nusra associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be defeated".
The United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene a new committee of government and opposition members to defend a constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem expressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee by saying that the work of the group should be limited to "review of the articles of the present constitution" without interference.
Because Trump will add the second mandate
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may expect, its presidency should not be concluded sooner because of an impasse or a scandal.
In what will be no doubt "the end of the most dramatic presidency forever!"
At the moment, there are no flash signals from the viewers.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night are more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on the first night, definitely increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million viewers in the fairs with the most important news.
"It's a fire towards which people are drawn because it's not something to explain," says Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC's television series "Designed Survivor" that tells the story of a member of the office who becomes temporarily president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scowell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The assistant told him he would vote for Trump.
You're asking him for the reason.
He said, "Why does he laugh at me?"
The chaos is therefore a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, Washington’s strategy can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment if immigrant families can meet or less and the state of health of the global economy.
To stop following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow up for the sixth hour a group of experts discussing the deep research of Bob Woodward for his book "Paura", of Paul Manafort's 15000-dollar leather jacket ("a full-fledged suit") and the implications of the disturbing descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of the Anatomical parts of Trump.
I, for example, won't be able to watch Super Mario without thinking.
"Part of the reason why this seems like a reality show is in the fact that every night there are news," says Brent Montgomery, a delegate of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", regarding the adventure of the actors and daily developments of Trump's show (in contrast with N.F.L., which commends Kim Jong-un).
You can't lose an episode, otherwise you stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a day of sun with almost 30 degrees, it was closed at home to watch the MSNBC and yet registered the CNN.
He was unable to get away from TV, while Brett Kavanaugh faced the judge committee of the Senate and in front of the future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we once made all those absurd programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Outflow of money in the course for the most sealed half-mandated elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is a cash flow due to the re-establishment of a congressional district that has made it possible for two members to be in charge now for the same place.
The recent re-definition of Pittsburgh's suburban district allows the democratic representative Conor Lamb to stage, who won his place in another district during a special election held in the spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, the republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is facing the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that, in the old districts, electoral colleges were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th district course launched a campaign characterized by a fierce opposition between the financial frameworks of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the special elections in March for the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied by a republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump added the district for 20 points.
Politicians have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then changed the idea
The diplomats have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Pechino, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather cordial meeting took place between the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump, who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners joined the Trump Organization's leading group.
The officials of the Department of State have decided to reintroduce the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", said the spokesman of the Heather Nauert department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million dollars from the Americans for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visa granting, would have been concerned about the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployed and killed.
Following a series of internal meetings, North America and Central America officials have held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which has been seen as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from taking their way into the United States.
But in mid-September the officials of the High Authority made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference by thereby giving up any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been charged to preside over the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in evidence of the importance the administration has attached to this meeting, the diplomats claim.
And the three American envoys have returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of pardon or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman from Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak in an anonymous manner on internal decisions.
The amount they reported was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who wanted to keep the anonymity at all.
Study History
In the report he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of a lack of justice, which seems to be sufficient evidence now.
In view of what is said, Mueller's investigation intends to shed light on the possible collapse of Trump with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress was to pass on to Democrats, Trump should respond to these charges before the voters and perhaps to a jury of his peers themselves while preparing for a new candidate.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not the case with its approvals in Europe.
In both Atlantic sponges, we have to make choices that will determine how long the fight might last.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to organize a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion we failed to let us escape the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of action in which the irrevocable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans at the moment have to face different challenges.
What would happen if Trump decided to license the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
The position of Rosenstein has been complicated since this journal itself indicated that last year has secretly suggested that Trump be subject to interviews by questioning his ability to find out the role of President.
Rosenstein claims that the news published on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of the possible charges of fraud and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to its actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to be prepared to face a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, he ordered me to enter the candels of the Sabbath with the swastika.
With a legacy of nature, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans dei Rangers is excellent at meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing victory against the Villarreal in Spain, would give them the best opportunity to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Even if because of an incturnion to the gun, the central champion Graham Dorrans has played his first part in the season just on the occasion of the 2nd match with the Villarreal, he believes that this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the thirty-nine player.
"We faced the convincing game of doing good and brought home a point.
Maybe we could win in extremes, but, of course, the comparison is a good result.
They were better in the first time, while the second time we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another big European evening.
We hope to win the three points, but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good outcome in the final game. But I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will be able not to give up.
The past year has certainly been difficult because of my infoturns and changes at the club level itself, but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys are having fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget the problems of the past season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term assistance
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas on the kind of assistance they would like to receive, few have faced the subject in the family.
About half of the interviewees from the Nationwide claim to have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% claim to have talked to your children.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Insurance Sector, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of themselves, but do not face this conversation".
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to help you if you do not temporarily communicate what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determined for costs.
Include a financial consultant: you can advise you how to pay the costs you have to deal with.
The selection of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a life-threatening life-threatening police to cover these costs or continue to spend money on insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all the documents necessary to avoid legal battles against your death.
Appoint a health assistant in such a way that a person in whom you trust can monitor medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you have not been able to communicate.
Please also assess the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions in your place and ensure that your accounts are paid if you have not been able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent is being rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer all the questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so as to be always ready.
"It's not just a financial question, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
A man hit more than once with an airgun in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed air gun as he jumped on his feet after having spent the night out.
The victim, a quarantiner, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was beaten to the chest, to the addom and to a hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "case action".
The victim didn't see his rapist.
It's not in danger of life, though, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Terrorists and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died following a severe earthquake and tsunami that destroyed the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The budget of the victims is intended to go out.
The communications are interrupted and the relief officers are unable to have any information from the kingdom of Donghea, a region north of Palu located near the epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Donghea in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the Sulawesi island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donghea is a kingdom that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north west of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, a province-dependent administrative region, had approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, particularly the coastal region of Donganga.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donghea have been attacked several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghea.
Another tsunami struck the western area of Donghea in 1996 by killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the sysmical area of this Pacific volcano and is often hit by terrorists.
Here are some of the most powerful terrorists and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: on 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226.000 people, more than half of them.
2005: a series of terrible earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern region of Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that have emerged from the southern coast by killing almost 700 people.
2009: a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the West Sumatra province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, along Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: an earthquake struck the Kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh by causing destruction and panic in the people who remembered the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the massacres.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom are in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate to Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
On the basis of a signal issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, he was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for arresting and arresting.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged alleged crime, he cut his phone off.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretreal Facility centre and its custody was set at $500, as reported by KTUU.
According to the television network, he was convicted on Saturday and was declared "unsurely innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-rate offences, i.e. detention up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
It has also been recorded a second-grade crime with a date of detention and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin is charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of stealing his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to signal the alleged aggression.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Court of Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, of arresting the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His fiancée accused him of hitting her with a bullet in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for having linked the child’s violent behavior to post-traumatic syndrome due to stress in the past period in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that destroyed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications network is not working and the victim's budget is intended to be released in the next few days.
The earthquake struck along the Sulawesi Centrale, which is located in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On the social media, video shows the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hits the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand the extraordinary capital penalty for suspects of terrorist attacks in NYC
New York's federal prosecutors ask for the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare punishment that has never been committed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a home Depot rental car to play on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing legs and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the Southern District of New York, in order to justify the sentence of death, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensively" and otherwise "intensively" had serious bodily injuries.
According to the Court's document, both of these charges may lead to the death sentence.
Seven weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued Saipov's 22 counts of imputation which included eight charges of murder with a criminal association, used in kind by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and car destruction.
The attack called for "a true planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said describing how Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and abused".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucci".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since New York's southern district persecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man mentioned in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to military service in September 2009.
The death sentence was executed for the last time in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through spying and crimes for having been informed of the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
The Rosenberg couple both died on the electric seat on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the documents of the Tribunal, Saipov, native of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of penance in the days and months following the attack.
The police claim that in front of the investigators, he is proud of what he has done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to end the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked the police to add the ISIS flag to his hospital room.
As regards the 22 heads of taxation, it was declared innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was said to be "of course disappointed" by the decision of the accused.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a recognition of guilt and condemn the army without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence group had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilise the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the members of the parliament of the Theresa May Party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the United Kingdom Party for Independence said that politicians should "press the pressure" of the Eurosceptics.
In March, conservator Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be already out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May must face in trying to reconcil the positions of its deeply divided party have been underlined by the Torys who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The first Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan between the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and to restrict the Eurosceptics and Laborers to choose between what May proposes and the "caos".
At the Leave Means Leave committee held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"At this hour we will be out of Europe," he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "They are for Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers Plan."
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought a world war to be servants.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
It is good to reject the opinions that the public opinion would be changed by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in Europe is completely false."
Parliamentary Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in the court and told journalists: "I just told the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public opinion in general, the opposition will not vote and will not be pleased with the interests of our party and our activists who turn to the streets in order to convince us to be elected.
Let's lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
In the Committee, Farage stated that politicians should be able to "simplify pressure" if they intended to translate the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to translate Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we won't let it happen."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to translate Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people's army of this country that has voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, those who prefer to stay in Europe have been on the way to Birmingham before having a two-hour commission in the city centre.
A demanding number of activists urged Tory against Brexit's flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The laburist has left the conservators for the security problems they have had with an app of the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for Canada's agreement more, for unlimited limits and for unlimited trade in Ireland," he added.
It's all a joke.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking of applying to the presidency.
Senator USA Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will think seriously if she can apply to the presidency.
According to Boston Globe, the democratic senator of Massachusetts Saturday spoke about his future during a civil assembly in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, was asked for a November election against the republican Geoffrey Diehl, who was co-chaired by the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors in the form of a civil assembly since Trump was sitting.
A participant asked if she wanted to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to install the government and that means a woman will get the highest charge."
Arrest for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge's police, in Louisiana, told him on Saturday that he had arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
Friday had a video of the murder asking for help to identify a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was beaten and killed near the campus of the Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gun wound to his head that caused him death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde was intervened to defend a friend and was attacked by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the crime scene in possession of a gun and that he had killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and held in custody at the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
The young player of nearly two metres raised in Baton Rouge, the short season Sims discussed 32 meetings of 10 with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his partner Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately evident that the orders of the Mercedes team would have severely imposed the race.
From the field, Bottas is a good part of letting Hamilton defend himself from Vettel's attacks in the first two days.
Vettel closes first to the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group code traffic, which may be decisive.
Mercedes makes the back of the next round coming back to the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, passes it through after some routine actions in which the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent him from entering the inside by risking to finish out after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen is part of the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh in the day of its 21st birthday.
So guide the course for most of the race without stopping to box for the rubber change and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen winning the fourth place.
In the end, however, the pip stop at 44° and in the remaining 8° is not able to increase the pace and exceed Raikkonen, which reaches the room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri worked well for the whole weekend and it was really nice for me to go through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first and second position," said Hamilton.
A gross example of body language
In a late Saturday's committee, President Donald Trump called on Senator Diane Feinstein to insist that he did not reveal the content of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused him of attempting to shoot the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony made by the Ford before the Court of Justice, but commented that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are "mechanical, catistic and budgetary".
"What can happen and what's being checked in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mixed, trapped and budgeted" he said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is published and the responsible say "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember your answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?--"oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn't do it" added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which the Ford accused Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the registration was withdrawn from his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Professor Ford, but I didn't reveal his story," said Feinstein to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information hidden and I did it."
But his resignation is not credible to the president, who during the Saturday evening committee commented: "I say, this is just a bad example of the body's language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of the body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the democratics are using these charges for their purposes.
"They are trying to regain power with any means necessary.
They don't care who harms, who must pass over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has signed two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's weekend in Elite League's match against the Belfast Giants winning the race back for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants have just passed on two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's arrows.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the team home to the couple before Dwyer brought the Ginants back in advantage.
Francois Bouchard mentioned the parity for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen declared their victory.
It was the third squatt of Elite League for Adam Keefe's men that Friday evening in Belfast had gathered and won the game with the Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times in this season and the Giants have won the first three parties.
Dwyer signed the first round at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assistant, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was the first time quite animated, Sullivan reported the house team at 13:10 a minute before Matt Marquardt provided the partner of the couple at Cownie at 15:16 a.m.
Dwyer has determined the advantage for the Giants by marking the second gol of the night at the end of the first time.
The house team was reunited and Bouchard restored the couple after a strategic manoeuvre at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have contributed to Nielsen's action that brought the Dundee for the first time in the meeting at the end of the second time and has ordered the victory of his team by marking the fifth gol in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play the next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controllers to allow hundreds of passengers to land on the ground
In Indonesia a flight controller will be named after his death to allow an aircraft carrying hundreds of people to decelerate and rescue them.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a powerful earthquake that destroyed the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong escorts continue to interest the area, and many are intertwined between the massacres in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fled to save his life, the windman Antonius Gunawan Agung stayed in his seat in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri of Palu, who was in a state of misery.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the track, was able to land safely.
So she was kicked out of the control tower when she thought she was going to rot.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian sender ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"For us it's really sad news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national disaster counter-attack agency will make it clear that access to the cities of Donghea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The task of the dead is to increase because many bodies are still under the massacres and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Agency.
Where up to 6 metres have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be performed on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and live.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
The clean water is draining.
The minimarkets are everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu Sunday and said to the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", as reported by CNN.
During the year Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Air Disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says there's a breakdown after the damage to the lake
The flight company that has fallen into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew members were able to save themselves, now claims there is a dispersion.
According to the news of Air Niugini, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing in the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships allowed other passengers and crew to arrive after the accident while the aircraft was trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
According to official sources, on Friday seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers have been recovered from the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What has caused the incident and the exact sequence of the events are not clear yet.
The U.S. Air Company and the U.S. Navy maintain that the aircraft has been hit in the lake because it has not reached the track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has reached a very low rate.
"And it was really a fortune," said Jaynes.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the airport emergency exits.
He added that the flight assistants had been taken from the panic and screamed and that he had been slighted to his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some mariners who were working near the vicinity to set up a bridge have provided assistance using a rubber to transport people on the river before the plane crashed about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in air traffic accidents with PNG but none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analystist rebuilds the night of the live burnt woman
On Saturday, the trial was completed in the new trial against a man accused of burning a woman of Mississippi in 2014.
The analysis of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell data to rebuild the movements of the quinton Tellis and the victim Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
According to the report by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he recovered the location data of several cell phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night in which he was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford presented himself on the Sabbath court and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the public minister asked him if Tellis told him the truth by claiming that the night was in the Sanford truck, he finally confirmed that he was "thinking because my truck was in Nashville".
Another misunderstanding is that Tellis claimed to meet Chambers for two weeks when he died.
The cell data indicate that they were known only for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed from his phone messages, calls and contact information from Chambers.
"He cancelled her from her life," said Hale.
The defence will begin its final Sunday argument.
The Court of Justice shall provide that the judgment expires later on the same day.
The High Breed: what is the known hip-hop?
A three hip-hop wants to challenge the negative view of the kind by inserting in its positive messages.
The High Breed group, of Bristol, claims that the hip-hop has been removed from its origins when it broadcast political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to return to the origins and make a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the United Kingdom thanks to characters such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York's father quotes a couple in court for licensed with a "racist" text
In New York, a father named a couple in court for allowing her to be discriminated against after receiving a text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuse to be racist by comparing the request to a true and self-constitution.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he discovered that his new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for his first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ON ANOTHER," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message for the husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after taking account of the error, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "smarted" allowed Mrs Maurice to say that she was not pleased with their previous father, an afro-American, and that she was expecting a Philippines.
He paid Mrs Maurice's working day and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice quoted the couple in court and, in order to be licensed, asked for a refund for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially taken, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said on Friday at the Post adding "I know it's a discrimination".
The couple replied to the racism charge saying that Maurice's license was the only thing to do because they were afraid they could not trust her after she had been beaten.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something that she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said Joel Plasco's husband to the Post.
"Would you trust your children to a person with whom you were cut off, even if for a mistake?
Your boyfriend?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true and self-constitution, Plasco stated that the wife has been involved for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"We can't reach a person in this way.
It's not a very kind attitude," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still under way, the court of the public opinion has immediately denounced the spouses on the media by harshly criticizing them for their behavior and for the following logic.
A letter reveals that Paddington's editor feared that readers would not appreciate a talking ear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter: “It’s not easy to put into the hands of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success achieved by Paddington."
By saying that the father, who worked as a cameraman to the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by an orchestra, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a little "severe" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a budgeted person," he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he was acting as if he had a child who got a trap: I'm afraid you're not even worth it.
I think you'd interpret Paddington's success this way.
Even though it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to tell my daughter that she was dying.
On the ground floor, the daughter was rushed to Nizza Louis Pasteur's hospital 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad has called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called me to tell me he'd be dead in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I want you so good.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of medicines that doctors had given them to allow the heart to continue to pump was slowly increasing.
He died a while ago and it was over.
I had to keep sitting and wait knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't cry, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to deal with it."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grown up for the loss of her daughter, went off the plane with the other brilliant passengers of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he said.
"For the rest of the time, I did nothing but cry on my head.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought you needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two adult women's tickets to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose lives have been murdered are committed to preventing others from committing the same act.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attacked a bridge in the Galles with motive messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and was killed at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel like every day," he says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, tells us that his son was a promising boss with a tragic smile.
"Everyone knew it for his smile.
They always said that he would light every room in which he went."
But before he died he left his job because depression had brought him "in a really empty place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his life.
Davis says: "Continue to fear that an effect on chain will be checked."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there's someone they can talk to, even if it's about a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old friend, not long after his mother died.
"You never said you felt depressed anymore," she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that her attitude had changed.
The day of Christmas touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he refused to look at them in the eyes."
He says that his death was a tremendous tragedy that they had to work on: "The family has suffered.
He made us pieces.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is certain: the FBI has initiated investigations
"I think that if we can proceed as you have asked, with limited time and scope, we can reach an agreement," he said, adding that he was afraid that the Commission itself was "losing peace" because of the blockade of radical supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to find out?
Their relucency is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks remain for the half-mandatory elections, November 6th. If the Republicans as planned will have a negative result, they will be very weak in their attempt to choose the man they chose for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators making pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him he met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
It will be voted in Senate, which is currently composed of 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to break the proceedings and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea political refugees "minimizes" with Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un was released to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the data from the South Korean Union Ministry, states that the refugees were 1.127 last year against the 2.706 of 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a more stringent border control between North Korea and China and the highest rates of entry from those persons.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which borders with North Korea is longer and easier to cross over the demilitarized zone (DMZ) strongly protected between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often withdraws them with force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearization that are in a state of state.
After this historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the United States sanctions for lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament for the first time," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh "stiric" and claims that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority, Nancy Pelosi, defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "stiric" and states that it is not naturally appropriate to recover this burden.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think that if a woman had acted in the same way, she would have been defined as narrow," said Pelosi about the statement made on Thursday by Kavanaugh before the Senate's judicial committee.
Apparently excited Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the grip of emotion, so much to get near the corner and with the narrow throat from the plant while talking about his family and the years at higher school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democracies who identified charges against him as a "sudden and coordinated diffamation campaign" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
The Pelosi considers that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has shown himself to be prevented from being democratic.
"I think she has been self-exclusive with her statements and the way she talked about the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
The Pelosi then raised an objection when they were asked whether Kavanaugh would be charged in case it was confirmed and whether the democratics should reach the majority of the House of Representatives.
"I believe that if it does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only appropriate for the Supreme Court, but not even for the court that is now in office," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as democratic, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about his intention to comply with certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
The Pelosi stated that "You cannot send a female person and part of the Supreme Court and claim that this decision will be accepted in a positive way".
And women must use it.
It's a fair, month and year of attacks of anger from which it can't go out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And he went on, "It really helped me a woman who was the leader of some parts. She told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique for which when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was a brilliant idea."
Lacrimes are tolerated as part of the rhaba because they are basically not understood.
One of the nicest memories that I have of a previous job in a male prevalence office is that once I was sent to cry for an access to clothing. A woman older than me, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly intimidated, took me to the corner and carried me along the stairs.
"Don't look at crying," he said.
"I don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and I'm happy because they're in trouble with you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his course to the presidentials.
In 1987, when on a ship called Monkey Business the extraordinary report of Hart was discovered that you had to give up on the course, the Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried to apply for the presidency itself.
"In fact, it wasn't a very balanced decision," he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running and no one else was sure to serve them.
Someone defined them as "Biancanaves and seven noses."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late with the fund collection and I swear he wouldn't have been applied if he hadn't collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the start.
He discovered that some of the supporters he had given to the candidates $1,000 would have given him only 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he had the speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (thanks to the people who had supported him, depression to the system that made it more difficult to find money and voters who represented and hated the sex discrimination he was victimized).
"It seemed like I was in the grip of a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder thinking about the printing reaction.
"Someone could have thought Kleneex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my paper.
Maybe "Very much pay."
How the U.S.-China Trade War might favor Pechino
The opening wars between the United States and China have been fragile and, while the battle is yet to end, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, has already launched this year's first warning by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was verified this week with the new taxes on articles for over 200 billion dollars (EUR 175 billion) of value. This means they will be applied to the average Chinese origin goods.
Pechino has always responded with measures of the same type applying recent taxes from five to ten percent over 60 billion dollars of US goods.
China has promised to respond to the US attack on the strike and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon go back.
For Washington to give up, he would have to give up his demands, but getting in public to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Pechino plays his cards well, the pressures of commercial war with the US can affect China in the long term by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision of Washington or Pechino can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far," says a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security research.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supported by the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the return of refugees and is looking for help to rebuild the country that was destroyed in the last seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which have had to leave behind because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily life and their support.
According to the United Nations estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million others who still live in Syria need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would accept voluntary assistance to rebuild the damaged country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any assistance under the circumstances or by those countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe wins victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The team Europe won Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on the European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy when the Danish captain team, Thomas Bjorn, reached 14.5 points that were used to beat the United States.
The US champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water at the sixteenth floor of the par 3 by giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfist was distinguished in all his tournaments by becoming one of the four players who always made a 5-0-0 registration since the tournament with the current formula was discussed for the first time in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the category Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has joined 2&1 in the English Ian Poulter who may have discussed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteron of Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia, who discussed it eight, became the European player who won more in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do it.
It was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm glad I reconquisitioned the cup.
It's a team win and I'm glad I made my contribution," said an enthusiastic Garcia after European win.
Pass the witness to his cousin John Ram who beat the flag of the Gulf of USA Tiger Woods with the score of 2&1 in Sundays.
"If I think I've grown up watching his encounters, I'm really very proud to have beat Tiger Woods," said the twenty-first Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his parties in France and now the account of his meetings in Ryder Cup amounts to 13 wins, 21 sconfits and 3 pairs.
A statistical difference if you think it's one of the biggest players of all times having 14 main titles, according to Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team has been looking for the weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain U.S. Jim Furyk said after a delinquency performance of his team: "They're proud of these boys because they've fought.
At some point this morning we have put pressure on the team of Europe.
We've broken through this occasion.
You're fulfilling Thomas.
He's a big captain.
All of his 12 players were very well behaved.
We'll reorganize ourselves, we'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll go ahead.
I'm in love with these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
That's all we've done.
But they've played better than us."
