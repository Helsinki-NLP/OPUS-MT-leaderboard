Two men in Kineshme and the region ended their lives by suicide
One of the above has already tried suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, in the village of Lugovo, where a man was born in 1947, suicide was committed by an increase.
It is known that he had already taken the attempt to commit suicide.
What moved a man to take such a step is unknown.
On 31 October, from 11 to 50, the inhabitants of Kineshma were killed by the 41-year-old man.
No signs of violent death have been found, the press service of the MO TV "Kinjemskai".
You got a black cat in your car?
As long as American road designers try to find money to repair the dissipating road system, many start to see a solution in a small black hole, which is right on your car's pickup panel.
These devices that monitor every trafficked car driver and transmit this information to officials are at the centre of the dispute of modernization of the adult system for the financing of American automobiles, undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
Typically, the hive of automagic planning has suddenly resulted in intense debate and colorful alliances.
The Liberals joined the environmental groups in lobbying the Government's right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you have gone through and perhaps even where you are going - and then to use this information in tax accounts.
Chepet movement in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
And although the convention is still not possible, whether it continues or not, a number of States do not expect to be assembled.
They think of how it is possible to move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of automobiles have already been tested by these black holes, some of which have the function of satellite satellites.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question that we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Association of Governments of South California, who is preparing plans to start monitoring by the authorities of the country of the world, which were run by each California car driver by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's a technology for this.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds in the Government's Road Construction Fund financed by taxes paid by the Americans on auto repair.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more miles on one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise taxes even at one cent at high gas prices.
"Benzine loan is simply impossible to keep," said Li Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on vehicles to test the payment system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
Charges call it a misappropriate payment.
It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road load and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planners in California are looking at this system in developing strategies for achieving the targets set by the ambitious laws of the state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Bill Shoster (Republication, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also considered this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market commitments in the Reason Foundation are also dependent on the fact that leaders are forced to pay for each mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to fall into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President on the political issue of Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers, who called for the 2011 Congress to move to a wrong pay.
The United States Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million last year, which would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city.
A few states and cities, however, are going this way on their own.
The largest enthusiasm is expressed in Oregon, where 5,000 leaders are invited to participate in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of escape instead of a gas station.
The pilot project in Nevada has already been completed.
He's looking at it in New York.
Illinois will try it on a limited basis with the participation of freight cars.
The I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 Eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each step.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem”, said Alauddin Han, a strategic and efficient management department in Nevada’s transport department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were complete, the Office of the United States of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be very difficult to convert these devices into a full-scale sequence.”
There is no need to create a large, large-scale technological infrastructure that will undoubtedly be expanded to keep records of the daily displacement of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult demand for low-tech technology is being pursued, which would allow state authorities to learn from the cars of miles, but without information on the location and time.
If you can do this, Han said, society will feel more calmer.
The demand for this technology has led some state agencies to a small youth company in California called True Mileage.
In particular, the company did not contribute to the collection of State taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market for the type of car insurance in which drivers paid on the basis of the escape.
However, the devices that it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with the modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t track their speed and do not follow their location,” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are a lot less expensive and less burdensome ways to do this.
The projectors are experimenting with different options for managers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they may give up all of the equipment by deciding to pay a fixed amount based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state are travelling.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea of a threatened public, preventing the devices from doing more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a taxable device that will also be paid by parking accountants, provide “paying as travel” insurance and collect pools of data on speed in real time from other drivers that could be used by car drivers to avoid fraud.
“ Automobiles will be invited to participate in the benefits proposed to them,” says the map of urban design.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder whether not all exchanges of misdemeanour are simply a huge drawback factor.
In the City Transport Commission on the San Francisco River, officials say that the Congress could easily exceed the bank integrity of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Streets by imposing taxes on petrol.
An additional single-time or annual charge could be taken from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when everything you need to do is to accept aspirin,” said Randy Rentseller, director of the Commission on Law and Public Relations.
If we do, hundreds of millions of leaders will worry about their private life and many other things.
EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of the economic pressure of Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan to ensure Ukraine's gas supply, as well as to reach agreement with the IMF on external credit, if Russia will take any measures in response to the possible signing of an EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating standby loans, and another EU official who is directly involved in the negotiations has added that their aim is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF Ukraine, 610 million euros can be received from the EU itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-term differences in funding conditions.
It does not believe that the necessary reforms for assistance can be made and that the international rating agency S&P, which was lower than Ukraine ' s sovereign rating on Friday, will be able to achieve one degree, until "V-" with "V".
However, EU representatives say that IMFs can show flexibility in terms of credit, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to ensure Ukraine's gas supply, which is now part of its supply from Russia.
Maybe it'll be gas from the North Stream or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to the officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in which Russia "insolinates" Ukraine.
The analysts believe that such a reverse supply approach could be used in Ukraine only within a few weeks, and it would likely lead to a reduction in supply in other regions.
"There are negotiations between EU countries and foreigners on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but on other routes," the author of Reyter added.
Russia’s external combat against urban pollution
Efforts to address transport problems in major cities have been seen in most of the world’s megapolis since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their refurbishment and expansion, or about their attempts to reduce demand for car travel, the number of cars and their time of use.
The example of Singapore is well known, where there is a high rate of growth in the number of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
His price may be twice the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have brought charges for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, there are so-called green areas where only vehicles with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electromobiles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a five-year clean air plan in 2012 at a total value of approximately 250 billion yuan ($40 billion).
As told by the Director of the Department of Transport Control of the Environmental Protection of Beijing Li Kunseng, the main objective of five years is to reduce air pollution by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, the increase in the number of private cars to a level of not more than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and the increase in fuel consumption by not more than 5 per cent in one vehicle.
According to the agency, car transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of general air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include restrictions on the use of motor vehicles as well as the introduction of additional taxes on drivers.
In addition, urban "green Friday" measures include a rapid transition from the rest of the country to the European fuel standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and labelling of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of older vehicles (including the creation of encouraging financial programmes to replace old cars with hybrids or electromobiles), the development of electricity (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-age).
Among the car innovations of Beijing, there is also a ban on all private vehicles moving within a fifth vehicle (all six of the CNR) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle number) and the issue of registration marks for vehicles on the basis of the lottery (e.g., in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of registration permits for private cars in Beijing was only three of the number of 2010.
According to the existing Environment Protection Programme 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 they were 138).
According to the Ministry, 41 per cent of all pollutants in the city's atmosphere occurred in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are more than 10 times more industrial and in St. Petersburg than nine times.
In the RFF, it is only to start thinking about the possibility of limiting car control on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and physical measures aimed at the demand for motor vehicles - if it is not popular - can only be taken by the public under their full universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its car park, where there are two low-performance classrooms, both office and personal cars, as well as "priorized" users, with a total of less than 200 thousand vehicles (about 5 per cent of the total number of cars in Moscow).
In the days of the urbanizations from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyse the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and road transport.
The main findings of researchers: the city centre is twice as low as required, and most car owners living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them on long-term parking or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parks, but to maintain cars, not to expand, but to reduce the passageway (to make the streets more friendly for passengers), as well as to limit the use and location of personal transport within the border areas of the historical centre (a total area of about 3212 g, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Taxation for unauthorized street trade in Vology will be increased at a time
In the view of the urban authorities, increasing the size of taxes would help to establish procedures in Volod and free the streets of natural parks and airports.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the product they are carrying out is often not under corresponding health control.
This means that health is threatened.
Yes, the lower fine for citizens for unauthorized trade in November will grow six times - from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, reports the Vology Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver of poor economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer credit and the mass reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it was fully due to consumption that was almost non-responsible," said the chief economist Goldman Sachs of Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting the fourth report of the Russian economy investment bank yesterday.
The nominal growth in Russia is now about 10%.
Inflation by 6 per cent, it will be able to provide a future consumer demand at the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
However, the profitability of Russian companies falls, so they are more likely to optimise staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in GDP: if payments increase by 10 per cent, GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafe explained.
The companies were faced with a reduction in profitability.
If she does not grow up, this can lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot pay, comments the main economist Barclays Capital for Russia and Vladimir Pantnusin SNG.
Unworkable near historical minimums, highly competitive for workers.
In order to move staff from the side or to hold current staff, workers have to pay.
The demand for support in Russia is also living at a fast pace in consumer credit growth.
In his view, Mr. Graffe did not provide this type of credit because of the high level of consumer loans for the multiplicity of the country ' s economy.
"We have not seen any benefits for the growth of consumer credit, money is not used for the economy, but return to the same banks as interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is -- in Goldman Sachs, there's a growing number of hours of unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who do not provide anything for them.
The percentage of such loans is high.
As a result, they are often not returning," Mr. Graffe noted.
The second threat to economic growth in Russia, therefore, is the possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of WHO, Vasili Solodkov, is now seeing signs of the emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, with no access to cash resources available in the households, were forced to attract the population by a high percentage.
In response, the banks entered the war zone and reduced the credit rates, the economy continues.
Small credit organizations cannot grant loans under the same percentage, otherwise they will have a negative percentage margin.
If the banks do not give up the deming, Russia is at risk of a full bank crisis, it is believed that Vasili Solodkov.
The licensing of several banks in the past week is considered by the economist to be the predictor of the mass theft.
"The same situation is not the case: the system of investment insurance has not been calculated in a system crisis," the head of the institution warned.
However, the growth of consumption is slow and without the crisis of unemployment, based on the decline in the indexation of the salaries of officials and soldiers in the current version of the draft budget.
A partial impact on consumption will be reduced by the freezing rate of natural monopolies (and as a result, inflation decreases).
But only partly: if investments do not grow (and the preference to this is not seen in the case), the growth of consumption will be slowed down, as is believed in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantnusin from Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prelude to the realization of the psysistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling prices on oil," he says.
According to its assessment, the economy of Russia will start to decline at oil prices below $90/bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to reduce the interest rates in the economy.
A paradox picture is seen: inflation has decreased, and banks have begun to raise taxes.
This may mean that they did not believe in the CB that announced the transition to inflation," said Clemens Graffe.
The central bank's interest rate policy does not affect market rates only on cross-bank credit rates.
"For the CB, it's the end of all hopes," Clemens Graphe assessed.
Banks are used, not to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As the rate decreases, the currency rate changes quickly, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the rubles.
"Prano or later the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graffe, and recalled that the state plans to release the ruble into "free navigation" by the end of 2015.
However, it considers that this should be done sooner or later, or raise the key rate of CB (5.5 per cent).
According to his assessment, the ruble course is now artificially up to 10%.
I'm just going down one road, and it's an expert's conclusion.
But if the CB is intrusive, even if there is doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it could break the ruble much more strongly.
In Chelabinsk, the people of the South Uranus were present.
The Forum is entitled to the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The meeting was attended by delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious conferences, legislative and executive bodies, with a total of 350 persons.
The course of the Forum is aimed at strengthening international consensus.
Here we can show examples not only in other regions but also in other countries.
We don't have any differences and differences.
We live in full understanding," says Feofan, the Mitrolotolit of Chelabin and Zlatustowski.
A number of issues were discussed during the meeting, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
The resolution was adopted following the meeting.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and dance theatre.
Here the exhibition of the national-cultural associations of the Chelabinian area was opened.
Ready to “co-operation” with Germany on United States exploration
Edward Snowden, U.S. D.A., said he was ready to go to Berlin to show the German parliament if the National Security Agency and its Director, Kit Alexander, were unable to answer questions about his activities.
The German delegation, Hans Christian Straywell, met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his data in Germany.
In a letter by Mr. Snoudena, who was presenting the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “As a result of my efforts, my Government has continued to deal with the incompatibility as a change and is trying to criminalize the political statements of criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to refuse criminal charges against him.
The accusations made by the Ministry of Justice of the United States include spying and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so".
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after claims that ABB had listened to Angel Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a member of the parliamentary team leading the corrupt intelligence service, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snoudena as a witness, “without compromising his risk and not destroying his relationship with the United States”, she should be used.
Mr. Streebelle, Parliamentarian of the Green German Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During the visit to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr. Streebelle said that Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had gone.
If Mr. Snowden had shown in Germany, he would have needed assurance that he would be there “in security”, said the delegate.
In his letter, Mr. Snouden said that he had been contacted by a “serious and persistent” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he had been inspired by a world response to his “political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including in the United States, considered the dispersion of an uncontrollable system of comprehensive consequences for society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the humanitarian situation is resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will receive a hand-held payment
Frontier Airlines plans to take passengers up to $100 because they carry a handbag on their train.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 per handbag and $2 per cup of coffee or gas, although their announcement in the middle announced that passengers could leave their entire bank.
The new hand-held fee is distributed to the bags in the top bag bags, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would take $25 if the collection was paid earlier, and $100 if the passengers were to pay only when they went out to land.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Melli said that the payment in $100 should stop passengers from paying for the advance payment.
"We don't want to get paid for it," she said.
The airlines started to pay for the first and second cash in cash in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these collections steal as much as they can in a handbag that is placed on top of the bag size, which is why they often do not catch places.
The meetings are one way to let passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't actually about making money.
The fact that the most loyal clients of Frontier claim that finding a place in the top bulkheads is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the company's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger on the way to the Frontier train can get free of charge, while the next passenger on the route can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Melley said that the change of procedures on the website and on the Frontier registration site was to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they arrived on the landing.
The new Frontier manual collection will not start until summer, even though the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about money for baggage and other collections, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the baggage is money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street believe that the increase in the stock exchanges indicates that airlines are taking enough money to cover aircraft costs after a few years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not care about the manuals.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection of manuals three years ago, and another Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said an air carrier consultant, Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional meetings.
According to his assessment in the December 2011 report, the collection of manuals amounted to $50 million a year.
Sorensen, former staff manager Midwest Airlines, recently flew by the Spirit train, and he was interested in discovering that he would be on the ground when passengers would meet with the unusual collection of Spirit by hand.
"The landing process was the most smooth of what I've seen for my career in the airlines," he said.
I've been waiting to see the toothpaste and the smoke on the floor.
And Samuel was a pool, and he said, "And the flood has passed by."
Frontier is also following Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or sugar could leave their entire bank and that coffee would be provided free of charge.
It will still be free to distribute water.
U.S. Airways had recently tried to pay for a drink in 2008, but refused to do so for seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airline had followed her example.
Frontier's initiative to get cash when passengers don't buy tickets directly to the airline is her last step towards attracting customers to their website.
The airlines pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 per ticket.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly to them rather than to go to a tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began to give two times less bonus miles of often flying to customers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
In the middle, it reached a minimum of 25 per cent of the mile.
Yes, a 1000-mile trip from Frontier, acquired by an online tourist agency, would provide 250-mile travel.
In addition, passengers can choose a location earlier only if they buy tickets directly on Frontier.
Frontier has the base of loyal customers in his hometown of Denver, but her business is cut down and she's going to lose.
The drop was reduced by 9 per cent and summer opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published in the parent company of the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to improve Frontier's finances in the context of the airline's sale.
ABB blames "inland error" rather than hackers for ending the site
The Secretary-General of the National Security Agency announced on Friday evening that the closure of their website for a few hours had resulted in technical damage, not in hackers, as stated on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during the planning update”, the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that the breach of work has been caused by a distributed attack on the type of “response to service” [DDoS] are false.
Earlier this evening, the online server monitoring system has registered that the ABB site has not been working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
Earlier, the ABB representative informed ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency “no” had been violated.
No classified information is in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online hacker group claimed that it was responsible for the conclusion of the ARB website with the help of DDoS attacks.
DDoS attacks are designed to penetrate the target traffic site until the servers are overloaded and the site is not out of the building.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal target network.
Previously, when ABB received the title “No Such Agency” in the last few months, the public attention and critical post-crisis post-crisis coverage of its extensive programmes abroad and within the country, all of this was the reaction to ABB's secret files stolen from the agency and published by former ABB Officer Edward Snouden.
The growing police in the agency area was so moved by the fact that today's incident was the result of planned hackers.
Bombardier's revenue is reduced by the amount of supplies and orders on the aircraft
Bombardier, Canadian aircraft manufacturer and travel company, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net income by reducing the number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
Bombardier, located in Montreal, also did not publish any annual data on its new CSieres aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious aircraft deployment plans would be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of an experienced pilot of the aircraft, which was about half a month ago, he flew only three more times, which raised questions as to whether the time was running.
The results did not justify the projections and led to an increase of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Fund.
Cameron Dorksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, dropped his assessment on Thursday from “upstream” to “internet” because of the belief that the increase of shares is limited to the nearest quarter or two.
“As a result of a reduction in the number of airships, we are clearly disappointed by the indicators of the transport department,” Doerksen said in a review of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as a follow-up to the summer test programme.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more sensitive to the programme.
The Bombardier company hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to take place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first pilot of the aircraft was introduced in March and the first flight took place in September after a few months of delay.
However, strong orders for CSeries are still not too much - 177, since potential buyers are waiting for summer tests to verify the company's approval of the fuel efficiency and economic potential of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and agreements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombardier would achieve its goal of 300 strong orders until the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
Four leaders also assured analysts and SMEs that the programme was moving forward on the plan.
“The pilot model of the aircraft remained on the ground no longer than expected”, Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and software upgrades were planned for a long time.
All manufacturers are planning a different test.
We decided to take the first flight and make a break for updates, and so did we.
This will take place during the entire summer trial programme.
The second of the five test samples must be carried out in the next week and all the others will follow him as reported by the company.
However, the analysis is sceptical about the claim that the first client would be able to start operating CSeries within 12 months of his first flight.
The company Bombardier stated that it would assess the date of entry into operation and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow pace of summer trials, however visible, and according to Bombardier’s internal chart, strengthens our view that the entry into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Dorkssen said.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, Bombardier's net income dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share last year.
The adjusted share income remained at 9 cents earlier.
The gross income dropped slightly — from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
The analysts expected 10 cents of share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world sized aircraft manufacturer reported that he had placed 45 aircraft in a quarter, less than 57 years ago.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of the Aviation Division's orders amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, as at 31 December.
“The results in the aviation area were consistent with our objectives, but the small number of orders coming and the common market conditions became an unacceptable factor,” Boduan said.
Aerospace income fell by 13 per cent — up to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest travel producer, reported that gross income in this sector would increase by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, which was slightly higher than on 31 December.
The income of the transport unit has been negatively affected by a number of major contracts.
The guidance stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced that the chief financial director of the Google Patrick Picet Corporation would come to the Board of Directors at 8.5 per cent, up to US$4.83 in the middle of the quarter.
Brazil's Embraer SA, a third world-sized commercial aircraft producer and the closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income.
Sony calculates a lower annual income
The Japanese electronic manufacturer, Sony's company, completed the previous quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of income for the current financial year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more impressive than it was expected that the demand for television, video cameras and personal computers of the Japanese corporation would be dropped.
Sony's television business, in the second quarter of the company's first three-year operating income of 5.2 billion yen, was reimbursed to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronic market survives much longer, especially due to a reduction in television demand.
While competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main opponents, Panasonic, has recently placed emphasis on industrial complexes: sales here are growing at high rates, especially through car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the financial year ending in March 2014, Sony is expected to receive 179 billion yen operating income against expected previous 230 billion yen.
However, according to the Thomson Reuters agency, the analysis suggested that this figure would be significantly higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
As soon as we get out of the crisis, Sony expands the product line.
In the middle of this month, a start was announced to sell "discreet" hours from the Japanese corporation dedicated to a number of fashionable functions that would enable them to deliver 100 times a day from the smartphone.
After Sony reduced the annual income and income forecast, the company's shares dropped by more than 11 per cent in Tokyo's market opening in the morning, reducing to 1668 by one share.
Gén said he was a synapses educator.
Students from the University of John Hopkins and Mount Sinai Medical School found a white one, which led to the "genome" Foxp2 perform its function by encouraging the development of new connections between neurons.
A study published in Science can be found on the magazine’s website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to the object.
His role was achieved in 2001 by the discovery of the family of several people who could not speak properly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that the work of the Foxp2 gene has been destroyed by family members, but the way he performs his function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions serve as an incentive for the education of new brain synapses related to word formation.
He does this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter has been found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate synapses education.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by authors, and only on its activity is Foxp2.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects ovarianization has been confirmed by scientists in the mouse experiments.
When the genetic activity was artificially reduced, they were less critical when separated from the mother.
If the activity of the gene has been restored, the frequency of the sounds published has also been restored.
Previously on mice, links had also been made with Foxp2.
Animals that introduced a human copy of the gene ate more active and less frequently than normal mice.
At the same time, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 is related to the work of SRPX2 and, accordingly, their management of SRPX2 with the clear "mechanical" aspects of sound education or more subtle processes.
Lawyer with cocaine dependence, who warned the head of the criminal investigation group in prison
42-year-old Bararat Kitta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
For three years, he was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A former lawyer who told the drug user about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Baraarat Kitta transmitted to the criminal authority Nil Skarboro the secret information on his investigation of illicit drug trafficking after he was threatened because of his cocaine dependence.
The lawyer who received the title of the Court and who was called a “high lawyer” was arrested in 2011 after a police investigation in Scarboro, which he had previously represented in a drug-related trial.
Officials noted that 32-year-old Scarboro left three packs of cocaine at the lawyer's home in the town of Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was in the company of lawyers with colleagues.
The result was found that the child was “regularly used” drug class A after tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he had tried to get information about two arrests on the orders of Skarboro and one of his colleagues.
All four suspects were currently under police surveillance in the context of the extensive investigation of the criminal organization on heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambridge, Mercisade, Berkshire and Western Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police took over the heroin and cocaine series at £1.5 million and over £200,000.
The 42-year-old child communicated to the offenders out of fear that his cocaine dependence would be revealed.
Today, forbes Solicitors, a legal firm in Blackburn, has been held in Liverpool's Royal Court, where he has been convicted in two cases of intentional obstacle to the execution of the trial on the outcome of the three-week trial in the Supreme Court of Liverpool.
He admitted to the custody of cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The lawyer's complaint was made after the police investigating the activities of Skarboro found that he had been regularly talking to the Dita on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found out how he came to the house of Dita in Blackburne and placed 60 per cent of the drugs in a black pen for the golf course under the law firm.
Shortly after Skarboro was transferred, he met with Dita, who was at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rowers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine talks were held between them.
The court found that the child had been “regularly used” cocaine after the tests had found the drugs of Class A in his hair, shirt and credit cards.
The child was arrested later, but refused to use cocaine, said that he spoke to the suspect dealer, as he was his client, and insisted that their community was a "professive secret".
During her detention, the child took his wallet and tried to obtain several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a haircut.
At the police inquiry, he said that he had also a domestic office, and his clients came to him in legal cases.
However, the court was aware that after important arrests, he called on the largest drug dealers, some of whom he had previously represented in court to tell him that they were known by the detectives.
He said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta was charged with abuse of his criminal status because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who provides his own lawyer.
Of course, some of his talks would appear legal, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly exceeded the limits of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He strongly prevented police investigation as far as possible to enable these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dieta didn't read his profession, but he gave it to her.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Skarboro, and allowed himself to be distracted.
The child did not admit his guilt and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer I was not a lawyer, and I would like to give information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not have stayed 15 hours, I would do so immediately.”
However, after the meeting of senior police officer Li Holsted of Lancasira, he said: “Mr. Dieta has turned from the criminal lawyer into a criminal criminal, just beginning to acquire drugs in the representatives of organized crime.”
His access to cocaine made him undeterred and vulnerable for the main participants of the criminal groups, who had commissioned him to receive valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow higher standards of professional ethics and instill confidence and confidence in society.
Mr. Dieta gave this confidence and tried to close his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Dita's case showed that Lancair was a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine detention, and now, in the process of preventing justice, showing our desire to obtain fair punishment for criminals.
Let the case serve as a warning for criminals that no one is outside the scope of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Skarboro himself was sentenced to 14 years after he admitted his guilt in a contract with the purpose of delivering heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
35 other persons involved in the machining were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dieta organized a conference in the form of questions and answers that he says his dream work is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal company for his treatment, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslave was not ready to host 22,000 spectators, and the police officers who were present at the CDC RFS meeting were noted today.
The ticket programme, they believe, has been expanded about twice.
At the time of March 1/16, the Russian Cubca, with Spartacus, was employed only a thousand studs under the regulation of nine thousand.
Spartacus patients were placed in 2200 places, 10 per cent of the combined stadium, but they were sold 5,000 tickets according to the Moscow Club.
This data was made known by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigorianz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the American Specialists, who preferred not to reveal his name, said that the States had heard the telephone talks of senior Japanese officials.
The person confirmed that there were several points for hearing in the country of origin.
He noted, however, that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during World War II when these countries were allies.
In Japan, as in Germany, despite relations with the Americans in the late period, the NHK telecommunications network reported.
Not one of the parties has officially commented on this information.
Remember, news of the United States Special Service's follow-up to the FRG Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the ABB could have listened to Merkel’s phone for the last ten years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some data, found his hearing very painful.
She stated that the associations she considered to be FRGs and United States for decades had not accepted such an observation by the head of the Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snowden said that he was ready to share details on the hearing of the telephone conversations of Angel Merkel with the officials of the German prosecutor.
Germany was a special fugitive in Moscow to meet with an ex-CHR officer.
Austria may be placed on the market at the beginning of 2014
In the course of public procurement interventions, the Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Nicolai Kovalenko considers it to be a black market at the beginning of 2014.
Today, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales in the Intervention Fund.
As long as the price on the market is higher, there's a question.
"Probably red will be displayed on the market after the New Year," he said at the press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, agricultural crops were 3.1 million g, including the crop areas - 1.7 million g, more than 3.3 per cent more than last year.
By January 2014, there were 550,000 g (more than 105 000 g in 2012).
Larged areas under a dry bed and tricycle, the seed remained on the previous level.
The IMF does not have a "Brade Round" group to which Lepsa was assigned in the United States
The Russian forces' database of the "Brach Circle" group, which Washington has counted on Gregory Lepsa, is of no use.
As Interfax noted in the FF law enforcement bodies, after reports of the Ministry of Finance of the United States of America, Gregory Lepsa's statement of suspicions regarding the European Criminal Syndicate, the entire database had been verified, but no such groupings had been found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian Mafia", which is abroad considered to be strong structures.
"But in the very name of the Brother circle, there's some element of confidentiality, it's a clue to a secret lie.
"It's all very similar to peer action," said the agency's assistant.
On 31 October, the Ministry of Finance of the United States declared that it had entered its suspect control lists in respect of the European Criminal Syndicate, Artura Badalian, Grigoria Lepsveride, Vadima Lellina, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacob Ribal and Igorya Shikivov.
The persons listed in this list are suspicious of the relationship between some Government of Leonte and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be members of the criminal groups and are listed in the United States Sanctions List since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps is "a curator for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leonteva".
At the Producier Centre, Gregory Lepsa refused to comment on the United States charges to a poet, calling them "the bred."
In 2011, U.S. President Barak Obama referred the "British Round" syndicate to "the major transnational organized criminal groups" and ordered the minifin to "remain and stop their global criminal operations".
The Black List of American Mining would lead to the blockade of its assets in the United States and prohibit business contacts with those living in the States.
The scandalous video came to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known as its scandalous and open-ended exits, was burned at the fire.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had the appropriate video and were ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
It stated that its post would not be left, reports CNN.

The head of local law enforcement authorities Bill Blair held this press conference.
Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share public data with the public, but he was given a gift for their existence.
According to Blera, the compromiser Rob Ford's video was discovered during the anti-drug raid conducted by guards during the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of this video, but there had been no confirmations in recent times.
I'm not giving any comments on this.
He's just saying they don't blame anything, and they're not going to go back.
The discovered videotape police is one of the evidence in the 35-year-old Ford Alexander Lissi, accused of trafficking in light drugs, demand, receipt of illegal income, as well as criminal talks.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The inhabitants of the city have long demanded the removal of their master.
This time, he had several discussions with journalists, showed up in a drunk way, allowed himself to be racist and sexy.
Assmann Beraten + Planen recognized the German company Assmann Beraten as the winner of the project projector's selection.
The amount of the contract in the "Ristovairoinves" is not disclosed.
According to the OAO Press Service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the expert expert at the 2014 spring.
The winner will be planning a new passenger terminal of the airport as well as infrastructure, internal roads and elements of the airport complex well-being.
At the first stage of the construction, the inner terminal area would amount to 50,000 square miles, and it could continue to be increased.
According to Rostovairoinveta, the draft documentation will include the prospect of airport development: by 2025 the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time of the end of the tender, architectural concept of the South Aeronautics complex, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been defined.
The draft building of the main terminal is the idea of an air bridge between Rostov na Donu and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experienced the implementation of major projects, the company has designed the terminals C and E of the International Airport Shermetevo and the new aircraft complex at the international airport Knevici in Vladivostok.
The international South airport complex will be built in the Aksai region of the Rostov region and replace the existing developments of the ski airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the urban structure.

Turkey's Politicians declared a capital against Syria's border walls
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separate wall in the town of Nussaibin in the south-eastern part of Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD party were severely opposed to the construction.
The mayor, who was at the border with Syria of the Turkish city of Nussaibin Aishe Geekhan, announced a headline protest against the construction of a separate wall at the Turkish-Syrian border, reported the RIA News in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (MDP) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly denounced protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish MID Muammer Guiller began examining the construction fact and then said that the wall was working to secure the border.
"Mr. Nussaibina Aysche Geekhan, a member of the PMD, declared the headmaster, thus transforming his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly battle," they said in the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, who have freely crossed the border during the semi-arid.
"It's an inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree," the party's representatives quoted Iishe Geekhan as saying.
According to the press service, the mission against the construction of a separate wall is planned in Nussabin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange course for its national currency - disease - with respect to the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, the Bloomberg agency was informed by reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange annual amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of US dollars.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the disease acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific disease rate for the dollar will be established later.
In February, Caracas was forced to sell the local currency to 6.3 dollars.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57.
Since the beginning of the year, the disease has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela accounted for nearly 50 per cent.
On 18 October, the Minister for Oil Industry and Vice-President Raphael Ramirez stated that Venezuela had no plans to eradicate the disease.
According to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of limiting prices for products and goods in general, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to the deficit of a number of goods and the functioning of a black currency market.
Last year, SMEs wrote that there was a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The Director of the Youth, Andrey Belmach, noted that it is still difficult to say how long it will take to find a new principal.
This post became vacant after Sergei Shepeleva was released.
The withdrawal took place a few hours ago, so to say how long it's gonna take for a new coach, I'm not ready, I'm ITAR-TASS saying Belmacha.
Maybe, day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
It is not just a matter of finding a coach, but a man who works in our club for several years and has some results.
The Chinese press is subject to a provocation law on SMEs
"This is a terrible place, and there is a reason for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judicial system in the future?" the newspaper said, calling the law non-institutional.
“This law is very serious and criminal, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Camau, director of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new judicial authority on the media “will always be vigilant, as it is the continuation of the Government”, and the restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya in the global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to his Members,” he said.
According to The Star, a new law will actually allow the Government to “take the dead cap on the media”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “have been hit by a serious hit” and criticised the bill as a “dragonist”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack of Muslim terrorists at Westgate Trade Centre.
The Chinese media provoked the anger of the authorities by transmitting surveillance cameras, where troops sent to the scene of the attack were supposed to occupy a expensive trading centre.
The reaction of police chief David Kimajio has been called by two journalists and the media officer to the interrogation, although the calls have been rejected after mass media protests.
Under the new publication law, up to 20 million Chinese shillings can be extracted, and individual journalists, up to one million with an additional risk of being “out of the list”, are prohibited from obtaining official logistic accreditation.
The court shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single strike is enough to parallel the work of the majority of FM stations”.
It also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called "lived blogosphere".
Politicians understand that, by keeping the media shut down, they can do everything they think they want to do without punishment.
“No one will ever know, ” wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterizing Kenyan media as the key source of restraint and equality in public life.
“Political policies themselves will tear the country apart and bring us back to rest and assembly,” he wrote.
The Chinese legislators were a mixture of public anger and in the past.
In May they voted for the abolition of the reductions appointed by the National Payments Commission and for the recovery of their large salary, which amounted to approximately 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new rate of expenditure for the home capital repairs in municipal payments.
Nearest estimates for the standard two-bedroom apartment from the new year are expected to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The Government of the region will determine the correct rules.
So when you're done, you're going to have to bring your cell in, or even replace the elevator, they'll decide for themselves.
Such a law has been approved by the MPs in the field of thought.
Vladimir Klučnikov, President of the Voronej Region, noted: "In this case, there is also a need to set the structure of the house, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which are often registered in Moscow, or in Orenburg, where this will be the establishment of government control over the cost of the housing that is collected by residents to repair multi-square houses."
Under State control now and on the left.
The law that protects the mussels is approved by the oblique in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty space.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people were injured by the unrighteous.
Most problems have been solved.
In fact, the new law prescribes the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the construction.
Vladimir Klučnikov, President of the Voronej area, said: "It is not a secret that abuses in this area also started with the fact that in 98, the same dolls fell and the same dolls were the same in 2000.
People started working on it to close the lake, including those two laws.
Under Voronej, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign citizens who were eligible for deportation.
The regional parliament has adopted this law not only under the terms of the federation.
The problem with illegal migrants in the region is still to be addressed.
Yes, in the past year, the migration rate has risen to some 100,000 foreigners.
But only every fifth has formal leave for work.
Where the rest of them are employed and whether they pay taxes is a big issue.
Vladimir Klučnikov, President of the Voronej area, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
The court doesn't have to be deported. They have to be held somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation that regional funds should provide such facilities.
In the Voronej area, such a place is defined as the Old Olshan of the Family Area.
Well, the regional parliament later awarded new benefits to many parents.
Firstly, families with 5 and more children are fully exempt from transport taxes.
The budget, in this case, loses 3.5 million -- but so many economics and many parents.
Second, and this is the main one who will take the 3rd and smaller ones from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides 18 square meters, at a value of 30,000 square feet.
The family, for example, of the 6 people - the father, the mother, the baby, and the 3rd.
For them, according to the rules, the State acquires a living area of 108 square metres - 3 million, 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West Micro-Micropolis, a completely acceptable option.
Well, at the center of this amount, you can buy a whole chain.
Baumgerettner appointed to the Council of Directors of Ukraine
The current Board of Directors of the OAO " Uralkali" proposed the application of the director of the Minske, Vladislav Baumgertner, in the new composition of the Council, to be reported on the Russian company's website.

Later, however, President Alexander Lukashenko at the press conference stated that Baumgerettner's charges were re-qualified for "the arrest".
"Nefthechemic" renderer Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladima Crikunov's resignation as a teacher of the children.
Holkiper believes that the performance of Chief Coach Dmitry Balmin is a major authority in the games and is in line with his responsibilities.
I remember, "Nephthechemic" sent today to Cricken's retreat.
If I'm honest, I don't want to comment on the release of Vladimir Crickin's release, Dalton RIA quoted "News".
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will deal with the obligations imposed on him, and I am not sure.
The team has a great authority, and this young specialist is definitely looking forward to the future.
The "Juventus" protector Leonardo Bonuchchi will not help the team in the closest match of the Italian champion with Parmoy.

U.S. Secretary-General: Services have been " too far" in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that the data and hearing services of the United States have sometimes been “too far away”, but politics has noted that information on the hearing of 70 million people in the media does not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people have not suffered during this process, but the attempt to collect information has been made.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was wrong.
I recognize this as the President and we will follow it so that it will not happen in the future," says the AFP Commissioner.
Italian trainers are on the way for young people
The Italian unemployment rate.
The data published in the medium showed that 12.5 per cent of the country's inhabitants were unemployed.
Such bad things have not occurred since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is a few times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 have no employment.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement for older workers.
Such an experiment has already been carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide early retirement pensions for staff.
In addition, Italy, on the other hand, looks forward to the problem of the elderly in Europe.
And the economists are not sure that the commitment to pre-term rotation is justified.
What does the construction of the TPU in Moscow bring about?
Each year, the capital authorities promise to increase the flow of transport-transports (TIPs).
It is planned to enter 255 WFPs by 2020.
As far as the project is concerned, our competitor is aware.
A couple of months ago, the Smolenska Metro Arbatsko-Pakrov Line was formed.
The signature stated that the transport-transport bridge was in progress.
All of this was very strange, since there is no ground transport left, and therefore it cannot be moved.
In order to reach the nearest trilleybus stop on the Sado square, it must exceed a range of 130 metres, including the ground crossing through the Carmanic River.
Now it's almost over.
Out of the colourless light, a wall was displayed for the gas, and the asphalt was transformed into a brush before the entrance.
That's the whole transport line.
Transport-transverse belts are plastic and capital, and they explain in the press service of the main transport department.
There's no capital VAT yet.
And the plastics are expected to build a park, to create commercial facilities that interfere with passenger movement, to create small architecture and well-being.
Of course, the plastic TPS is not even a transporter, but professional repairers from the capital repair department of the city of Moscow.
Transport is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Michael Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy of the High School of Economics.
Sometimes it's too wide over the head and table that announces the time of the arrival of the transport.
For example, it was recently opened in the "Yasenova" metro.
Let's get out of the bag, but with the parking lot and a table indicating when the bus arrives.
But the number of officials in the U.S.A. record everything that happens to us.
In 2011, Mary planned to build a total of 151 houses, 59 of them with capital construction.
It is now estimated to be 255 WFPs by 2020.
One of them promises to give up this year.
Although there are no quality criteria in the city, there is a TPU development programme in the city, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "Gorod and Transport".
The number of objects is calculated, but the quality of each of them is often impaired.
The criteria, according to the expert, must be two: first, lowering the time of the transition, second, favor.
First of all, it's possible to change the type of transport without going under the rain.
In Moscow, time is running out.
An example of the "VDNH".
The earlier train buses with the Yaroslav six arrived at the shelter before the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their positions were transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the streets of Cosmonauts.
Far from the metro, far from the monarchy, so closer to the living house.
Because the inhabitants did not want a car under the windows and complained at all possible stations.
With the capital TPUs in Moscow, it wasn't so soon.
The first of them started building five years back at the Plannera Metro.
The project was called to be exemplary.
Indeed, it has been shown that the surplus surplus paid to investors is turned into a banana trading centre.
No, there's a bus stop here, a train so you don't have to walk from the subway under the roof, and three stages of the car.
True, chemical trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in Moscow's TPU did not give priority.
The way I got them out of here is far away from the subway.
That's why there's more to trade.
It's just one of 32 stores, and there's almost all of them in the car.
Well, in fact, who's gonna have to buy a new car on the road?
When they build a capital VAT, we always have a commercial centre.
The situation has recently reached its logical conclusion when some of the authors have decided to place them on the market.
Now, on the third stage, the "Plannerna" TPU among those marked on the parking lot is fighting.
Animals, species, Chinese genes, nerves, and defenders who are badly looking at our photo.
The front door was finally turned into a base.
The fact that the Planerna was a market earlier, but they got it.
And in the prefecture of traders, they came in and left for a reconnaissance park.
It's always empty because of high prices.
It's even funny that the market came up to build on it... a new flat-rate TV.
That's how it's done.
In the "Caluscian" metro, the distance from the subway to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trading center, the TTU cables increased to 170 metres.
To get to the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 22 hours, when he is shut up, he must be held in open space.
In addition, the structures on the Planet and the Caluje will soon be shown with flowers.
In mid-September, the Meridian Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPs.
Four of them will be 25 years old without two or three underground roses.
The main monster will grow at the "Tushino" metro, which will have 418.7 thousand square meters.
The representatives of the Directorate of Railways of the RHD responsible for the construction of the Metro have already told journalists: in future multi-stage shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, the officials are convinced that multi-stakeholder parking must be between three and a half of the area.
Let's take for example "national" garages.
It is said that the garage at 258 locations, recently built at the International Street, has a area of 8015 square feet.
So for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars in Petrov-Rasomov, there will be about 80,000 square miles.
It's less than a third of the machine that's going to be built there.
Let one or two stages go to every bus stop.
It remains as at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial instability.
And that's, in a minute, almost two HOMEs.
If the capital PTUs are built at stations and angles, the remaining areas will be filled with metropolitanos.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
In fact, in the department of the city of Moscow's property, the journalists were recently informed that they were preparing a draft decision that the investors would be able to seek a place for the TIP for the officials directly.
Without any competition.
Therefore, he asked that transport issues for the city were a priority.
The perfect TPU is, for example, the Garvard station in Boston or the Spadiana in Toronto, a certain Alexander Morozov.
The trolleybus and tramway are below the ground level and the distance from the train to the tramway is 50 metres away from the road.
There's no single trade around.
But the Moscow officials are finally breaking up.
We're either going to build nothing, or we're already playing 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser suggests comparing the extremes of patriotism with the deterioration of patriotism
In order to protect the legality of citizens against Russia ' s persecutions and abuses of justice, the Russian Federation proposes to compare the abuse of patriotism with extremist activities and to punish imprisonment for five years.
As the News newspaper reports, such amendments to the legislation drawn up by the thought-making committee on the energy of Oleg Miheev are already being sent to the Supreme Court and the Government for adoption.
Under patriotism, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the human emotional relationship with the country in which he is a citizen of the country, who is responsible for its judgment, respect for its history and culture.
As Micah indicated, parental legislation imposes sanctions on the formal characteristics of the State authority - flag and herb.
However, in the view of the Parliamentary view, the protection of Russians, who may be subject to and abuse of public symbols and other expressions of disrespect for our country, is insufficient in Russian legislation.
As an example, it introduces an annual debate on the Day of the Victory, when some media persons have allowed themselves to question the heroic approach of the SSR people to combat fascists.
The launch of the main national festival - Day of the victory 9 May - is being launched each year.
Exposed in ostronomy and “alternative view” of history, some publishers come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, the Germans did not break up with the Soviet Union!
I think it is absolutely impossible in a country where pride for history remains the main “spiritual strength” of the nation, Oleg Miheev is quoted as saying.
Moreover, Micah said that the patriots in Russia are much more than religious, but the law condemns the offending of believers, and the patriotist feelings can be virtually impunityd.
In the view of the national electorate, it is necessary to compare the deterioration of patriotism with extremist activities and to prescribe the appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for a penalty for the deterioration of patriotial feelings: from 100 to 5 years of imprisonment.
The earthquake of Magnitudo 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the city of Kokimbo in central Chile, the Reuters agency.
The map of earthquakes was located in the ocean at 10.7 kilometres deep and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, described on the U.S. Geological Service website (USGS).
These were fixed at 20:03 at local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
There is no information on the victims or landfills of destruction.
Remember, Chile is one of the most seismo - active areas of the earth, so it is not uncommon to land a variety of forces there.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
The earthquake of 8.8 Magnitude and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in Chile occurred in the latest history: a magnitude 9.5 was established there in 1960.
As a result of this natural disaster, more than 5,000 people were killed.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be considered strictly in accordance with Russian legislation.
France may be confident that the case will be considered in compliance with legislation, and we are all concerned.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with the prime minister of France, Jean-Marco Ero.
Among the detained activists, Greenpeace is a citizen of France.
Peru Pisanu, like the rest of the activists, has been charged with imprisonment.
"I asked if we could expect humanitarian violence against a detained citizen," Mr. Ero said.
“Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structure that seeks to influence technologically complex and dangerous processes, including the acquisition of energy, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "as a garbage dump," and recalled what happened in the Mexican Gulf, he referred to the RIA News.
The United Nations announces new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations should immediately begin its work on a new set of targets for the replacement of the Millennium Development Goals, which have been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty all over the world.
Australia's diplomats played a key role in promoting "Sustainable Development Goals" in the CRT exchange, which was extended in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, launched at Rio de Janeiro by evening.
They were included in the outcome version of the document signed by world leaders, including Ms. Hillard, at the time of the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ghi Mun told the summit that the time had now come to “remain above national interests”.
“I am pleased that UN member States agreed to launch and take control of the process of establishing universal sustainable development goals, the CSD”, he said.
These CSDs will be based on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which will become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers I have been given by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the successful implementation of the ICT.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the look of them under the status of Samori Mahela, President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered at the center of Maputo to scan the world's legends on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sussa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed the business suit on a football field, reduced the title “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined in the fourth to the top of the capital Independent Square.
Within two weeks, virtually every day reports of the encounters between government troops and Renamo were received — one of the worst hits since the end of the war more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known as a rebel movement that was supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then by the Government of South Africa, apartheid in efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 revolution, it became an opposition party.
The analysts believe that the country is about to return to a full-scale conflict, but recent developments have made it difficult for foreign investors and local residents to break down.
High rates for the fast-speed economy, as the opening of large greenhouse gas stocks and coal sites in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party Frelimo, the leader of the political force since 1975, and the party of Renamo accused each other of the pressures they had created.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has become the founder of the last round, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo camp, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels were followed when the government forces attacked the base of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, reported the financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo on the initiation of the attacks by accusing the party of an attack on the military.
President Armando Gebuz has tried to address the threat of instability.
AFP, a French intelligence agency, said that Mr. Dhlakam felt like a failure, who wanted to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelymo and Renamo insist on avoiding war.
However, fear grew after the announcement that Mazanga had declared the rejection of Renamo of the 1992 Peace Agreement.
He reported that he had been in a state of non-compliance with the Freelymo Party Agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously," said Mazang.
The previous negotiations between the parties had little to do to lessen the tension that has intensified the series of talks this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have spoken the language,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
Neither is a good negotiator, nor is one of them willing to go to the necessary conclusions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the following year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to achieve the Government ' s acceptance and financial bonus.
The vote for Renamo was reduced since 1992, when the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) party, which was based on the former member of Renamo, was expected to improve its indicators on these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuz, who had to leave his post the following year, would like to destroy democracy in the country by the end of his second term.
"He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to leave the president's post," Mazang said.
It is not clear what opportunities are open to Renamo, but it has already carried out devastating and intense attacks on police stations and cars on the key car from the north to the south.
Most of the shells were located in the province of Sofala, a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but it includes Beirut — a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.
In June Rio stopped using railways about a week after Renamo was threatened by an attack on the railway.
Masanga was stressed when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique were not going very well”, Masanga said.
Dissatisfied by the Government, and many people are also victims of corruption, slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People believe that responsibility for future countries is a government and a president who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultwan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
"No one likes either Renana or Frelimo. They just want to restore peace, they want free access to the streets," he said.
A series of Prime Minister Art Meinstrim shows will take place in Moscow.
The Art-Minstrim film series, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release into the park, will go to Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA "Novosti" with reference to project organizers.
It opens the Art-Minstrim programme by the French director and actress Reim Kerici "Parez at any price".
This is the story of the French capital of the Maye model (Kerici alone) which is deported to the family in Morocco because of the problem of visualization.
In addition to the Kerichi film, viewers will also show a new picture of the so-called South Korean director Kim Ki Douk "Mebius", melodramatic novelist Oliver Hirsbygel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and film of the Canary Film Festival "Jijn Adel" Abdelatif Keshi.
The only Russian "Art-Minstrim" participant will be the winner of the "Kinotavor" festival of Alexander the Veledin's "Geography Globe" film on the grounds of the same novel, Alexie Ivanova.
The main role - the late failed teacher of Victor Service - in the film played by Constantine Habenski, whose work was also marked by the award of Kinotovra.
Children should study mifes and legends as “models of the pattern of life”, says the author.
The statements about Tore could show that “the force of power cannot overcome the tension,” and the legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many mifs will become “too thick, too scandalous and, in some cases, too inappropriate for teaching in schools”, Crossley Holland speaks for “study group” suitable for the age of texts.
"I think it's amazing that in America mife and follor are already part of education," he said.
I said that I would introduce them to the 20-year course.
He added that “extreme moralism” of authors and teachers “takes interest” in children, and the fundamental ideas “simply” in educational history.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beovulf from English-Saxon, as well as the Norwegian Mifs Collection for the publication of Penguin and the British People's Statements, said: “You may, of course, have intentions, but you better keep them with you.”
Perhaps the greater difference between the adult author and the adult author writing for children is the need to feel something.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy conclusion, but that there should be an understanding of good and evil.
And this should be subliminated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Voronej area, a football fan was stopped, which broke the window in the waiting room
At nine o'clock on October 29th, two football fans, teachers of the Moscow area, were fired from the passenger train.
On his way to the game of a favorite team, the boys set up a drinking bag on the way.
Young people were sent to the police station on a daily basis to establish a protocol on administrative crime.
The fans were scattered in their antisocial behavior.
The police formed administrative material for them and left them.
Young people bought tickets on the next trip and waited for his arrival at the station.
In the first half of the night, the fans left the building of the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the window of the entrance door in the waiting room.
The police officer and the RHD security guard were on the ground of the broken glass.
They were able to arrest a criminal who tried to hide from the scene.
A verification is carried out by the South-East LLU RSD staff in Russia.
In response to the issue of incitement to criminal proceedings, the senior information and public relations rapporteur of the South-East Lulu MWD Russia reported on the transport of Sergei Olkhvik.
Vitaly Mutko: Waters?
I think we've been back for 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the irregularity of the tribunals at the time of the meeting of Cuba, Russia "Shinnik" - Spartacus.
I am a party to the responsibility of sports organizers for all of this: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they took a long position.
They're waiting for someone to come by and order.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite right.
The patient should be organized, the clubs should invite their chairs, not leave the case alone.
We have now developed a special government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
After it has been adopted, we will take this issue seriously.
But I'm still obliged to invite all the football organizers.
I read Leonida Feduna's interview.
State, please, give the law faster.
It feels like it's the Bwari patients in Yaroslavl, and it's all set up.
And we're side observers.
And it's really terrible to see how the tribunal gets out of Brandspoy.
And it's in a country that's ready for the World Championship.
"I feel like we've been back 10-15 years," said Mutko.
They may ask in Russia
An ex-employer of American services, Edward Snouden, will not, most recently, go beyond Russia to provide evidence on the hearing of the telephone negotiations of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a prominent source of the situation, an American may respond to questions from representatives of the German Geneva Office in writing or in Russia.
The exit of Edward Snoudene beyond Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses the status of a refugee and may be issued to Washington by the U.S. allies," the agency's associate said.
“However, in principle, the FRG Department could send its representatives to the FF or transmit written questions to Snouden,” the source added, adding that this matter should be dealt with at the cross-border level.
Former German Bundestrian Hans-Kristian Straebelle reported that Edward Snowden was ready to give a presentation on the question of hearing by the American negotiating services of the German Chancellor.
It was prepared to show to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The CRU staff understood that he knew so much.
Although the United States ABB blocked all its movements, Snouden was ready to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions of his arrival," Striebelle told Euronews.
Advocate Snoudena Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of the Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with the German investigators, but when and how.
U.S. citizen Edward Snouden, who worked at the National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after obtaining information on the secret operations of the United States Service for follow-up on the Internet.
A hit plane through the Moscow Transit, but could not leave the airport because its passport had been cancelled by the US authorities, who had falsely charged it with serious charges, and remained in the Sheremetevo Transit Area by the beginning of August.
On August 1st, Snouden received a document providing him with temporary asylum in the territory of Russia for a year and that same day, Sheremetivo left.
American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren said yesterday that his client was working in the "big Russian company".
German media reported on Angelo Merkel's ABB sequence last week.
According to journalists, the American Chancellor’s telephone talks began to be heard in 2002.
The post office was in the United States Mission in Berlin.
The German authorities, following the publication of these reports, stated that the sequence of Merkel violates the laws and the sovereignty of Germany.
I've seen the rest of the "Justice of Russia"
A member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilia Ponomarev, made a statement on exit from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian said, he made a statement in the new regional office of the Party.
According to her constitution, this automatically means that Ponnomar has left a number of "records".
We sit down, drink tea...
"Why do many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponnomarev is on the table," but there is nothing like this in the past," the MP commented on his decision.
Ponnomarev noted that good relations with the Regional Office of the "Esseravs " remain good.
In the meantime, Mr. Ilia Ponomarev's mandate is not intended to be rejected.
He explained that, despite the party's departure, he remained a member of the party and could not get out of it by law.
Statements of the intention of Eli Ponomareva to leave the "Justice of Russia" were made on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Hudkov and Valerius Zubov would come along with him, but the last time I examined this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese media, Foumio Kisida, met with the Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergeem Lavrov, to discuss matters related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to exchange views on further political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of the peace treaty”, he said at the Kisida meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after the visit of Prime Minister Sindzo Abé to Russia, relations between countries became more intense and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RFB would meet Japan to address complex political issues, writes RIA News.
The conclusion of the peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the solution to the issue of the disputed northern territories.
In this regard, action in Tokyo today calls for the return of countries lost after the Second World War.
At the Japan table, the cars are built, which are said by the speaker, "The northern northern territories!".
The police don't stay with the protesters, they're following in order not to exceed the level of noise.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Year of New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said with courage that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedian in America: almost a hundred years ago, ex-consistency artist Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell the audience directly.
In time, Faya's innovation was hosted by others -- a recent New York comedy festival.
Caroline Hersh, founder of the Carolines Standap Club, celebrates his tenth anniversary this year, taking into account more than six hundred shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these Headliners started in Carolinas, and then made more progress, reaching the level when they were already too well-marked to appear in the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to keep working with them.
This year, the event includes the statements of Wanda Sakes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the stand-up for heroes, the annual musical comedy welcome concert for the soldiers in Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among the others Bruce Springston, John Stewart, Roger Watters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival's expansion, the comedian world has expanded.
Several comedies participating in this year's festival have gained popularity through non-traditional methods, such as the show on small-scale comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll was informed by the role of a comedian series on a small-known cable telephone (the "Liga" on FXX on the subject of football) and is now leading his own skiing show at the Comedy Central.
Jenny Sleet came into the actor's room on Saturday evenings in the direct ephere, as well as in the Parks and the spirit zone, although she was best known for the series of viral Roles of Marsell-Racks.
And Crowley, and Sleet, as well as other young self - styled comedians (surrealistic psymsist Anthony Gesselnik, a bad focus on the tribal theme Camau Bell), are the result of a decentralized American comedian world.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be the interview of David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comic, but then he became a successful director of television and movies, as well as an informal story of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a TV show known as Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall Hall Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the central element of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when I arrived here, he would sometimes play around two houses and think, "If I stay here without money, I might live here."
Pakistani authorities started negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities started negotiations with Taliban.
This was reported by the delegation of the country in Great Britain, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British vice-president Nick Clegg, with which he discussed Pakistan and India, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that dialogue with the Taliban movement had begun - a statement made by the Pakistani Embassy in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
Pakistan ' s Taliban (Tehric and Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same Afghan movement, but they operate independently in the northern and western regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani talismans are provided with the establishment of an Islamic State.
In the past, the Government of Islam had tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had declined from dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would only take place if the authorities took the place of a permanent deployment of troops located in areas where the Taliban were active, as well as the release of prisoners of Islamic prisons.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Economic Forum for Islam.
On Tuesday, 29 October, Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Government of Pakistan and Afghan President Hamid Carzay, held a three-party meeting in London, where the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan were discussed.
The oil was worth $96 for the barrel.
The price for oil continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns about the education of large stocks were closed to a message indicating that the energy industry in China was taking power.
The Italian oil exchange rate in December rose to 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel at European time later on in the electronic markets in the New York Stock Exchange.
The fourth contract amounted to 39 cents, which amounted to a drop in prices by 5.8 per cent in October.
The rich oil stocks affected her value for the last few weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated that the stocks of the United States had increased to 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over 25 million barrels were filled in five weeks.
On Friday, however, a reference was made to a possible increase in demand by a judge on two reports of the Chinese industry showing the extent of its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of the economy of China may continue to take effect after the rate of growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent, the international oil chain, also used by oil companies in the United States, amounted to 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Square in London.
The principal coach of Colorado Patrick Rua, justifying the decision to release the Holchiper Seed Varlamova from the first minute in the Friday meeting with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night after the decision did not rob him of his confidence in the rose, he handed out from Dallas a letter of "SE" to Natalia Shmeleva.
And what are we waiting for?
Of course, all of us are worried, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be beneficial for him to go to the ice today.
We want him to go up to the ice and show his usual level.
Are you absolutely sure that the situation has never been described in the circumstances of the buyer?
This is what I see today.
Our games will no doubt support Varley's efforts to help him keep his mouth shut, as it was in the previous match of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia there must not be a vegan: a hot tomato will not replace a soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, the RIA News correspondent explained.
People who have completely rejected products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
There is no winter without health loss, and no warm winters compensate for them, and the busy days of the Vagana are considered to be of no use by neosophier diethologists and doctors.
Drink oil with litres
Strong vegetarianism, when rejected not only by meat and fish, but also by milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dentists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities, there are strict rules on food such as minimum health.
A complete rejection of animal products is worth it.
Animal whites contain unchanged amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for plants.
It must be compulsory to be included in the race, whether it is milk or eggs," said a certain diethologist, Marina Godi.
It is an example of a fish containing Omega-3-free fatty acid.
Their riches will be of no avail to them.
"To need it in the quantity necessary for man, it needs letters to drink," says a diethologist.
The doctors are convinced that the residents of Siberia need to pay particular attention to the reason for the winter.
In this season vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
There are high demands for food in our realities.
In order not to freeze, increased calories are needed.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, he does not need that calorie," said a specialist.
That's what Dr. Olga Poznánk agrees with.
It adds that the fruits and vegetables are not coming out.
It is better to ask a person about products that have been raised in the region of life or where he was born.
The genetic code is aimed at better adoption and reversing these products.
And the blind people don't want to warm up, but the warm doll or something else," explains the doctor's position.
According to her, there may be vegans that are currently benefiting from various evils, bugs, bugs, local crops, apples that remain in winter, frozen eggs.
But this is obviously not enough for a full diet.
In the opinion of Dr. Clavdi Arifulin, the Sibirians in the vitamins are only enough from mid-August.
Full vegetarian transition in our harsh natural conditions when temperatures can change by 30 degrees and in May the snow is unmet.
Life's organization needs energy, and that's, first of all, rain," says the doctor.
Doctors note that voodoo is especially valuable to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And with vegetarianism, we're giving them a little bit of appreciation.
Beverages are also needed to increase the contents of white, vitamins and micro elements in the menu.
"The fugitives don't touch them," said the Trusted God.
Aripulina says that an adult wants to choose everything that is convenient, "to play in the games that he wants."
He's already formed an organ, a skeleton, an organ.
Still, children need to be asked in full.
If parents leave him with some microelements or amino acid, choosing for him what he will be, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
"Even if any of the other substances for brain development, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All trained medical professionals are of the opinion that there is a low level of greenhouse gas emissions in the heat and transport of fruit and vegetables.
The heat brought to us is less of the micro elements we need than (reduced) in the open oven.
"Product quality isn't that," God says.
Aripulina also notes that imported and hot fruits and fruits are far from ideal standards.
The desire of manufacturers to collect more fruit results in loss of quality.
"The apples don't become useful in the marketplace, the ants quickly want and dance, the ants are inexhaustible and non-aromatic," says medical examples, adding that they are often overcrowded with the amount of benefits.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This is not consistent with the observatory of the Siberian Institute of Physical and Technical Affairs of Agronomics, the applicant for the science of Vera Petruk.
She said that, in the right manner and in compliance with all the rules and requirements in the heat, it was possible to develop a full crop.
If they try to get more out of the square meter, it will eventually become more and more frequent, and it will reimburse the growth of mineral wells.
For example, when too many nitrogen improvements are rapidly growing, they are large, but watery and fragile," she explains, adding that the quality issue is primarily dependent on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court suspended the decision to "stop and search" in New York Police Department
In the fourth appeal, the Federal District Court suspended the execution of a judicial decision requiring changes in the program to "stop and search" of the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
The Second District Appeal Court of the United States stated that the execution of the judgement of Judge Shire Shendlin would be suspended before the results of the appeal were received by the city.
In August the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city appealed for its decision and decision on corrective measures, including the provision for the appointment of a controller to help the police offices change the practice of work and related training programmes.
In the fourth case, the appeal court heard a debate by the parties on the request for a suspension of the case.
The Appeals Court stated the need to dismiss the judge because he violated the Code of Conduct of US Judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid the demonstration of predictability, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements that contained a public response to the court's criticism.
The court ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, calling on black people and Latin Americans to “stop and search”.
It appointed an external monitor to monitor massive changes that included policy reforms, training and control, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras in the police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to terminate the practice of keeping the names and addresses of persons who were detained after the police inspection.
The city appeal shall be held after 14 March 2014.
The tactic to “stop and search” has been criticised by many lawyers on civil rights.
“Research” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented remains has increased dramatically in the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people, most of whom are black people and Latin Americans in 2011.
In 2004, four persons, all of the representatives of the national minorities, filed a collective appeal to the court.
The parties to the "stop and search" programme in New York police departments say that these changes put an end to poor practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other police departments implement this practice.
The respondents claim that the changes will reduce the war spirit of the police rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money spending and do not address the global problem of the complex conditions in the police due to the decrease in the number of officers over the last few thousand years.
The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of “stop” seeking, which was in conformity with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York police were staying with people.
A walking zone was opened in the area of the Third Gallaries.
In Moscow a new walking zone was established.
It is located in the area of the Trinity Gallery and takes part in two kilometres from the Metro "Novoznezke" station to the Bolott Square.
All over the course, street bags, flowers, shoes, and toilets have been set up, closed by loud arrests and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Climate and Lavrusin revolutions that were already on the way, five streets were closed for cars - the Ordian Tupik, the Grand and Little Tolmachevian Revolution, the Kaddeevian Coast and the Bolott.
The traffic on the streets of Morocco and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the 5th Street from the airport of Novošnekya to the Climate Change Station, the conditions for the journeys were created without the removal of the movement and crossing of the passage of the passage, transmitted newsmsk.com.
Inside the walking area were the Trinity Gallery, the temple of the Pope of Rome, the museum, the library, the monuments, and other monuments.
Previously, all the roads had become the Turkish pass, the Stolist of the Revolution and the Kuznecky Bridge Street.
The larger Dmitrovka, where the walking area was opened early in September, was decided to close for the exit and holiday cars.
Coulson escaped to the cell phone to check the confidential communication
Former editor of the World News of the Andy Coulson reportedly used the “telephony, causation and resistance” in an attempt to prove false information about the Roman Charles Clarke, who was then serving as Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, King's lawyer Andrew Edis, informed Old Bailey that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World had received news that Clark met with his “scrutable Special Adviser” Hann Polby.
The newspaper told private detective Glennu Mulkeiro to delete the voice mail from Polby and alert her at home to get an interview, but Koulson also called her and left her a voice message, the court heard.
"The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person who will stand at the top of a house hoping to stand up for someone who wants to offer people history to see what they will say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World used three ways to investigate history: the damage of telephones, cassettes and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the next, he just owes.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone damage?
He says, "No, we say, "Yes."
Hearings about the Romance Clarka first drew attention to the edition of News of the World, when a source of sexual interest in Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she and Charles."
The audio tape received by her phone at least three times was withdrawn from the house of Mulkeir in August 2006.
The followers also found records on the computer of private detectives in which Miss Polby and her sister described as “Projects”.
During the period when she was under the seat, Mrs. Polby's grandmother and grandmother received anonymous calls asking to provide information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Türlbeck and former reporter James Usherap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movement.
Having left her a vote on 18 June 2005, Colson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would like to discuss with Charles very much.”
Mr. Edis said that the Coulson's participation in this history had taken place on the same stage as other influential individuals, such as former Interior Minister David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blancett on the issue of Roma with a married woman at the time he himself met with relative Rebecca Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to enter into an agreement with other people with a view to breaking the telephone between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeir, Türlbeck, and Wehrerp were recognized by the telephone.
Snouden declared his willingness to contact the FRG authorities on the hearing
CRU staff Edward Snowden expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as possible and meet with the representatives of the FRG authorities, transmits RIA News.
The letter of the former CRU official to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was submitted by the Bundestrian Hans-Kristian Strebelle, through which Snouden sent a message to the German authorities.
The striker met with Snoudden in Moscow.
Four people suffered as a result of a fire on the Tavern Street.
As a result of a setback at the collection center in Moscow, the Turkish street suffered four times as a result.
As Interfax reports with reference to source in extra services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, the passage during the fire was damaged by an earthquake.
According to RIA News with reference to the head of the capital department of the fuel and energy industry of Paul Livinski, electricity is now fully restored in all houses on the Turkish street.
The fire in the heat collector's home on Thursday, October 31st.
From the edge of the canalization, there was a strong smoke, and in the underground transition, in the Armenian store, there was an earthquake.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses were housed on the Turkish street.
At 21:45 in Moscow time fire was eliminated.
The United States of America provides food aid for the poor
Food aid for families from four persons is reduced to $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial supply of the production tables known as "footsteps" is reduced as the action of the relevant public programme is completed.
For food aid, family members of four will now allocate 36 dollars a month less than previously, to the official staff.
This will affect 47 million poor Americans.
According to the Reuters agency, in 2012 the contribution of one person to the financial year amounted to an average of $133 per month.
Food aid costs in the United States increased to $80 billion annually due to unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans are dependent on the free food aid issued by the footsteps, which has been called from the past when they had the form of packaging.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans of the Congress require further reductions in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
Food stores throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
Congressmen of the United States continue to argue on how further funding can be reduced by the Government.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
The Blizzard study released its 1994 Blackthorne platform free of charge on PC.
That's what the WoW Insider reports.
According to his data, the game has become available in Battle.net in the classic game Blizzard.
However, some geomers have noted that only users who are currently able to jump are those who are involved in the American service.
The game is still not available for Russian users.
As SMEs deliver, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC does not differ from the original game option.
Soundtrack to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne platform, which Blitzard released 19 years ago, went up to the SNES console.
Its events were unfolded on the planet of Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and bright kingdoms.
Once, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light King Vlarosa and become the only ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlarosa Kyle, who was rescued from death and sent to Earth.
Twenty years later he returned to Tuul to fight with the Saralacs and protect the planet’s inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the study released after its name was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was the company Interplay.
New cars appear in the Moscow Metropolis.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money, but for meetings.
One trip worth 30 rubles is for a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will be taken into account by modern technologies, the ITAR-TASS report with reference to the Press Service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be established at the “Exit” station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new tickets, the President of the Olympic Committee will take over the Russian Aleksandr Jukov and the Olympic Championships of Alexei Namov and Elena Zamlodchikov.
The recognition of the National Security Agency strengthens the peer-response corporation
At the end of August, a German police helicopter flew down over the U.S. consultancy in Frankfurt, the financial center of Germany.
Under the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), Germany's internal intelligence service, it was intended to photograph the U.S. Mission building of less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German SMEs say that BfV had hoped to detect the antennas of listening devices, and these actions had led to negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Clepper, director of the United States National Investigation, once again reiterated in September that the United States did not take advantage of the possibility of external exploration “to replace foreign business secrets for American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
However, since Edward Snowden, a contract servant who became a publisher, has begun to publish his secretarial of U.S. intelligence, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports of the United States National Security Agency following Petrobras oil company in Brazil and obtained access to data stored by United States cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised a number of national-wide corporations at new levels.
The last chapter learned that Angel Merkel's phone had been listening for some ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a mouse, of course, the potential mice are also business leaders.
Snouden has worked closely with the United States intelligence services and companies.
I think it's quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany should be ashamed,” says Oliver Green, president of the BITMI, who represents the small and medium-sized IT company of Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in industrial spying and data collection, according to a study published in July by the EY Consulting Agency.
However, in all documents published by Mr. Snowden, there has been no evidence that the United States had communicated the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policies expressed concern that the EU did not have certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are sceptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we must create a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It’s not a option,” says Gaso Plattner, president of the German company software provider for SAP business.
If there is a need in a strong European IT industry, it should not be allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT industries.
However, the technical development of the United States spy agencies, known as the discovery of Snoudene, has also been a shock to some companies who previously thought that China was the biggest risk of the collapse.
There is a lot of confusion in cloud technologies where leaders of European companies have better known that the data in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the U.S. Coast Guard after the release of the U.S. software for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Snowb, one of the Executive Directors of the SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new issue that has not occurred a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are merely proof that they already know that the powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and consequently, these data must be kept at any price.
What's going on is economic spy, it's amazing.
He always had a place.
“It has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not significantly changed in the current Poland,” says Kurt Bok, chief executive director of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because it is in our national interests to protect our businesses.
The corporate leaders usually do not like to be ashamed of the responsible measures they have taken, as this may give the opposite advantage.
In large companies, the idea of taking a free bottle for a show or leaving a notebook without a look at it in the street is, at least, invisible.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi automotive company, says that it has been standard practice for many years — to collect mobile phones before government meetings so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that the directors of companies consider the possibility of using simple mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently deleted.
However, there is a risk that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to injuries and injuries.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific lows.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns the BfV report.
The United States has warned its own economic spy companies from other countries.
The National Intelligence Union in February replaced France, together with Russia and Israel, with a number of other violations committed with an interest in economic exploration, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic spying, France is worse.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of an adult from Georgia who died in an “unbelieving case” believe that their son was killed
The parents of an adult from Georgia, whose body was found inside a turned sports mother in his middle school gym, believe that their son had been killed, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in the vertical mother's seat behind the tribunes in his high school gym.
Follow-up to the district sheriff Loundes concluded that Johnson died of a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family objected to this.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son has been killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Cramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jaclin Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff said.
“They think this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics, as well as to a healthy sense,” Kramp said.
They think it's a cover for the protection of the human or the people responsible for the death of their son.
They sent their son to school with his school bag, and brought him back to the fold.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Mur made a statement at the press conference on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts they'd bring us.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I believe there are sufficient grounds for an official investigation,” he said.
He told the reporters that the first resurrection showed that Johnson died as a result of the “positional assimilation”.
However, the second resurrection, said Mura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
It added that if he found sufficient evidence to require a criminal or civilian investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the governor of the district of Loundes was not available for the comment when he was called to it in Thursday.
The judge of South Georgia, in the middle, proposed to the authorities to publish all video footage of surveillance cameras that were watched by observers.
Adult parents said they were hoping that video recordings contained the key to the delay of his death.
"Spartacus": Information about persons who have taken the fascist symbol
The official website "Spartacus" revealed a statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of a tribunal in Yaroslave of the Fascist flag.
On October 30th, the unknown prosecutors at the stadium in Yaroslavle showed a fascist symbol.
Welcomes all those who have confidential information on persons who have committed this criminal offence, and requests that it be provided
"The reward is guaranteed," said the statement.
Search of fans carrying the Fascist flag to Yaroslav
We remember that in March 1/16, the Russian Cubca Shinnik, "Spartacus", was repeatedly interrupted because of the irregularity of the tribunals.
A fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartacus hospital sector.
The Spartacus punishment may include about three blinds without sight.
A meeting of the Committee will be held on Friday.
If you have any information about the person who passed and brought this symbol, please contact us.
Disease Control and Prevention Centres issued recommendations for schools on allergic to children
In the middle of the disease control and prevention centres, a list of recommendations for the control of food allergy in children in schools was published.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the Government of the United States, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergy is growing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The disease control and prevention centres have found that the prevalence of food allergy among children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information to the school on how to raise awareness of teachers and child nutrition services and how to provide assistance in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenaline storage — most often for injections — an automatic EpiPen medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The laws of the states recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make savings of adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It's like a word in my tongue," "I have a voice in my tongue," or "a spell."
The parents of intersexual children may choose “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third generation of children born with pregnant sex organs of an intermediate type.
The bride will no longer be obliged to sign a male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any half of such children by allowing parents to indicate the gender as “undefined” or “undefined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make quick decisions on sexual harassment and to combat discrimination against persons of the same sex.
One person, according to BBC, said many years ago, "I'm not a man or a woman".
I'm going to be a doctor-in-law with the sinuses and scars.
Some two thousand children born each year are neither a boy nor a girl.
They have an intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual development” — a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (sexs or sperms) or commonly developed armed sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
The gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the field cannot be determined, it would be better to use all available information and bring it into line with what is expected and to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation is carried out.
New York Psychologist, Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemmas.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You can take a field without an operation and then see how a person develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions why this is happening.
It's like a reminder of why people are gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as being different from transsexual or transgender, as they are not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, nor are they typical of both at the same time or in any of them.
These characteristics may be reflected in secondary sex signs such as muscle mass, hair cover, breast and body tissue; primary sex signs such as reproductive organs and genetics, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gives a general picture of discrimination faced by inter-sex and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as on the level of stress, violence and crime on the ground of prejudice.
Boys with gender exclusion now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place a male, female or “third floor” in their official documents.
In June 52, Australia's 52-year-old Norri May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “free” in court to maintain an “undefined” sexual status for all life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a third sign in addition to M and F to X will be used in German passports is intersexual.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on Canal France 24.
In 2011, ten lawyers from France, this clearly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “generical theory” from school teachers.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that “in a situation where peace is being forced into a new state where sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity—no, we are transforming two more stages of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported on the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that children set up sex at birth.
“Let the child grow hard enough and without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know half of your child,” she said to parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historic children born with male and female sexual organs were called hemorrhoids — in the name of a beautiful Greek god who had both sexes.
And yet another ten years ago, the medical community had adopted a gender as a letter that could be deleted and then re-entered.
However, many now dispute the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and sometimes the doctor makes an unwise choice, not knowing how the child will accept his gender when he grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called "an emergency psychiatric case," Dresher said.
When these children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of dealing with children with intergenerational types was proposed by Dr. John Mani of the University of Johns Hopkins, who believed that the gender was easily altered.
He introduced the term “general identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social — how parents grow children — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were under question.
He advised the parents of a boy that the penis was damaged during an unbelievably pregnancy, that the child would be completely cast away, that he would also be removed from his eggs, and that he would grow up as a girl.
“I presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it wasn’t,” Dresher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But he committed suicide in 38 years.
Dresher said that some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the coming of the Internet, people who survived these sex exchanges declared themselves "missing results".
This was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but of an intermediate type.
The doctor could not determine whether he had a large client or a small pension and was convinced that he would never be able to live “a full life ” for men.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, the outer body and the bones of Bruce were surgically removed, and he was questioned as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was appointed to be a vaginoplastic.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genetic development.
Upon learning the truth, he again became a man, got the testosterone’s degrees, and removed his chest.
The operation made him worthless.
Today, he stands for the protection of others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to get people involved in sexual harassment.
However, Ann Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Reported Choice, is concerned that the German law “enforces the renewal of conflicts and progress”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and give the child an “undefined sex”, she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.
We think it's better to get a male or a female sex, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law is manifested, so all we can do is build up assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to make a third-party choice”.
“Aging people must have the opportunity to make their own decisions on formal sex,” she said.
The German law meant its adoption at birth.
This is a conflict in which young children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, a pimmologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder that helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Katy, was born with male chromosomes, but she had a sexual development disorder called “the syndrome of complete unconsciousness to the Androgens”.
As her androgen receptors work wrong, Katie developed female signs.
She's got a place to sleep, but she's got no mothers and eggs.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and has a child psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite her poverty, she hopes to be a parent through adoption or management of a grueling motherhood.
"The law gives parents time not to make quick decisions themselves," Barac said.
He gives them time to do some analysis and to discuss the situation, as well as to spend time before they write “a man” or “a woman”.
In that case, you're all right, you're growing up, you're loving the child.
You have a wonderful baby, and you're happy.
We don't have to do an operation that doesn't work fast.
“This allows children to take part in the decision and remove the violence that drives parents, because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
At the end of the child’s life, it is remarkable to see how much better it is for him or her to be more comfortable.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
" Chikago" was stressed by Nikolai Habibulin: he understood that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russians, he will continue to work hard on training.
At the last two meetings, Habibulin first missed six teas from Tampa Bay and then four from Otava, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed tea.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't get it, CSNCHICago says Habibulina.
- I need to find confidence in the training that I'm sure I should look for as a game and try to achieve a better outcome.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some snowy coke.
Maybe I need to get some rest.
The adversaries - I don't think I'm the one - always trying to play an ideal game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of me.
I'm still working on it so I don't miss so much.
It's good that my classmates support it, but in principle it's just that I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But what happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'll just try to play the next game better.
The train turned to Altae.
In the Rúbsz region of the Altay region, the railway bus was turned into PAS.
As a result, 13 TIRs have been reported to the MIC regional administration, according to the clear data.
Earlier, the region ' s law enforcement authorities reported 10 injured persons.
According to the agency, the accident occurred about 9 hours a day at the local time of the highway Novonikolaevka - Wišnevka, 1 km from Novonikolaevki.
At the bus station following Rubzovska in Wišnevk, 12 passengers and driver were found, all suffered from various difficulties and were hospitalized.
Eleven wounded were brought to the city hospital No.1 Rubzovska, two persons being hospitalized in the Rubzovska CRB.
Medvedev estimates that SSJ-100 aircraft will be placed in Europe
Russia estimates that Superjet 100 aircraft will also be placed in Europe after being placed on the markets in Latin America and Asia.
"We count it to be more than 170 examples of such a type of aircraft in general that we are able to obtain such agreements," the words of the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, quoted at the press conference with the French Prime Minister Jean-Marco Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that close cooperation with the French colleagues had been carried out, as it was a joint project.
We have now discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that once this aircraft is built on Latin American markets and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be assigned to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be put in France," the Russian Prime Minister stressed.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by the Soho Civil Aviation Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The Liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in 100 passenger locations.
The Energy of the Daykeepers started a unique rescue program...
In an old age to bring up an ass’s yard, the village on a high table was set up a chair from the roof, and the heavy nest was well kept on it.
Such special exercises have long been out of place, so the true love of the cables of the electrotransmitters is based on the passage, which makes the true home a reliable home.
Uncle Anya, who lived in the village of Ivanovak of Petríkov, had been living in the home of a family for 20 years, began to notice how the nest sits in spite of all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds lay on new eggs, and the lower layer has already passed between the eggs, the egg's moving.
Of course, a sad family of aristocrats who had been burning in the back of the yard every year had to pick up and clean up three-four birds in summer, but they didn't want to stay without the light.
As only birds were caught in the hot end, Uncle Anya called at the Circan REC, which belonged to the opposition.
And she didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the snow was still standing, told the Technical Director of the Dneproproböler, Sergei Berzewski, the DTEC Technical Director.
In fact, the corrosion had already begun in the nest of 150 to 200 pounds [150 - 200 kg].
At any point, birds could die of electricity.
Yes, and the local people were at risk of being left without light because of injuries.
Therefore, linear patterns have begun the rescue operation, not the first time in our practice.
They assisted scientists from the National University of Dépropetrov, who developed a gender transfer scheme.
They have trained local network staff.
A well-known sunscreen organizer, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised energy at all stages of gender reconstruction.
For the first time, it was thought that there were more than 50 true "courts" in the emergency situation.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms with a memory of the furnace were removed.
They were mainly fed by windmills, and then they carried the old nest there.
It is thought that it would be sufficient to place the old eggs as a basis for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
It's time to find their own apartment.
The first nest was rebuilt last month in the village of Peschanca Novomosko region.
A new railway station was set up with an electric current and installed a platform on it with an old, well-known knife.
All of the operations have been combined with the energy of nine thousand criminals.
And on days the same new population took place in the village of Ivanovak of Petrík in the village of Granny.
This is where the platform was built in the former place, just in the process.
Ornitologists are convinced that careful, conservative birds are not even aware that their "square" has been under a capital repair.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four other nests in the Pokrovska and Crichan region of Dnepropetrovcina.
As long as some are saved by rare birds, others are mercilessly killed.
Day after day, the entire area of the airborne news, in the village of West Kamenka Apostolos, on the day of the opening of the pool at the fascinates, fired a libedian family who was trying to find a place to live.
The blessed birds were not afraid of the people, the locals of their flocks, nor were they afraid of them.
When the farmer heard the shootings, ran to the bridge, four of the lesbians were already lying on the water dead.
The Police Department's staff are now finding out who shot a bird in the Red Book.
The Russian Mars is becoming more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of the People's Unity, Moscow will be hosted by the "Russian March" Mary.
According to the Lewada Centre survey, Russia's support for growth has grown - 40 per cent of citizens agree to the idea of their conduct.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens agree to the "Russian March" conduct: 11 per cent of them are specifically positive and 29 per cent are "more positive".
The popularity of the Russian Marsh ideas gradually grew - in 2006, only 14 per cent of Russians were welcomed, and in December 2010, there were already two more citizens (28 per cent).
"Determining negative" to "Russian March" is only 7% Russians, 19% more negative.
35 per cent have not been able to shape their relationship with this action.
In this year, Moscow agreed to hold a Russian march of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, which is now reported to the head of the Department of Security of the capital of Alexei Majorov.
This act of nationalists takes place every year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Did you hear that the Russian marches were held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans of the protection of Russian rights in Russia?" three fourths (75 per cent) responded negatively.
Only every fifth Russian (20 per cent) knows about this action now.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, nearly three thirds of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard on the Russian March.
We remember that three years ago, on 11 December, the Maneja Square had passed a physical match for nationalists, who had grown into mass irregularities.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians what holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
For two years, the number of those who knew the right answer (People's Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
In addition, only 15 per cent of citizens gather to observe this holiday.
It is estimated that (17 per cent) will be set aside on 7 November of the October Revolution.
Most (62 per cent) are not going to notice any of these holidays.
How Mary Moscow agreed to the Russian March in Lublin
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to the "Russian March" ceremony in Lublin on 4 November.
The leader of the Russian Federation, Mr. Dmitry Demushkin, reported this.
In addition to the six months in Lublino on the Day of the People's Unity, there will be a match and a rock concert of the Colovrat Group, also agreed with the authorities.
As "Russian March-2012"
On the Day of the People's Unity in 2012, the Nationalists passed the sixth from the Yemeni border to the Central House of Artists, where they met.
The organizers assessed the number of participants in 20,000, and the VAT referred to the number of 6,000.
Communication: Obama's Premier headquarters considered the exclusion of Byden for Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers of President Barak Obama had secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden of Hillary Clinton's candidate in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest sensation of all the expected books of Mark Galperina and John Hailemanna on the 2012 campaign "Dubnished Stocks: The game changed 2012".
The Times had received a copy of the book ready to be delivered and reported on Thursday evening that the Vice-Presidents had conducted “a wide range of study in focus groups and discussions of public opinion at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exclusion of Baden could help raise the growing hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political prosecutor The Times Jonathan Martina, the book provides a detailed description of the efforts of senior pre-election and White House officials, namely the former head of the White House administration, Billa Daily, to assess the impact of the vote on the appointment of former vice-president Clinton.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected at the Chicago Premier headquarters and at the Oval office.
Only six closest advisers, including Daily, former head of Obama Jim Messina’s prefect, and former White House consultants David Akselrod and David Pluffa, knew what the exchange was about.
The book Stacks doubted that Dalia was an initiator of the attempt to replace Baden, despite their “close personal relationship”, but eventually refused this step when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the list of elections did not significantly improve Obama’s chances.
In an interview with Martin Daily, the Administration confirmed that it had indeed considered the possibility of replacing Baiden Clinton.
"I have been actively talking about a lot of things, and that was one of them," said the Daily newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "O God, what shall we do?"
Although Dale described the study as an “required verification”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters had done much to investigate whether this step would lead to the vote of dividends.
“The pre-election headquarters will not spend such much money on surveys and focus groups if they do not consider anything interesting”, said Martin in the AK 360 programme.
It is not clear, however, if Obama knew that his command had been investigating the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dali if he knew his immediate boss about the possible breach.
Although Dali said he did not think that the President had been in the course of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration recognized that Obama knew “probably”.
Martin added that the "Dublined Stocks" did not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political reconciliation had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the possibility of excluding Baiden from the electoral list.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
You want a light in the dark of the sea?
The British company has created the first in the world to shine through the darkness of the sea with the help of the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to produce a fresh food.
He came to this idea by reading a science article on medusas and convinced Chinese scientists to restore a light white.
The brain reacts to the language of the one who is it, increases the pH in the protein and causes it to shine.
Chris says that since the sea starts to shine when it reacts to heat, it means that the more you lie, the more light it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the company "Lise me, I'm delicious," says, "It's amazing, but it's still at the very beginning, if you're talking about production, so you're getting about £200 for about 2 g of the substance."
The protein we use in the sea is in response to your language with a neutral pH.
So when your mouth gets white, it'll raise the pH and the sea will begin to shine.
We tested it over the past few months, and it was said that it would be ideally presented to Halloween because it created such a remarkable lighting effect.
This may be the most expensive marine thing I've ever done, because the meds are four times about gold.
So I've got about £140 for every joke.
That's why it's good enough for breakfast.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is marked by its unusual tastes, including beer, red, cheese, and the taste of social gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible sea.”
It's impossible to determine because of the ice crystals caused by ice, but I think we'll find a way to do this.
The marine uses fluorescent media that are synthesised by Chinese scientists
Trainer "Avangarda" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of the preparation of his team to the master of the regular KHL campaign against "Salvata", noted that the militias carried out a thorough analysis of the damage from the Magnificent Metallur.
The Specialist stressed that Avangardu needed to pay greater attention to the game in defence.
We have seen a video match against the Magnificent Metallugra - the official website of Avangarda is referring to Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of tea, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew the opponent was executed.
According to their statistics, there were five assaults on the way, three of us were killed.
It's a very good realization.
Were these errors taken into account when preparing for today's game?
We talk to the kids every day, talk after the game, prepare for the new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is done.
They've all seen the first period of the match against Metallurga.
The game was performed, and the account was 2:0.
They've gone through the hole in the pit, and in the third period, they're starting to lie.
In view of the heavy composition of the game, he did not see any sense of belonging to the defenders.
We have to defend the whole team.
Now, Avangarda has a long home series, and it's coming through the day.
All teams are in the same condition.
The key is the realization of its moments and the performance of the game.
Hockey is a emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not going to be that hard.
As a result of new regulations introduced by the Russian customs office, nearly a week on the border with Russia is around hundreds of forums.
Today, indigenous officials promised to provide drinking water managers and to establish biofuels
In border crossing points, hundreds of furs have been dug in Russia.
This situation has resulted in a change in customs rules for the carriage of goods.
Ukrainian border officials and customs officials confirm that it is essentially a Russian party that has not previously warned of news.
Since 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have taken additional measures to ensure the delivery of goods, the Deputy Chief of the East Customs, Vladimir Dennisov, has reported.
A new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The missed items are in strengthened mode.
The Factow Correspondent arrived at the border and contacted the dealers in the situation.
The prices in the passenger coffee shop at the Novoazovsk pass point are increasing with each day, as well as on the surface.
The gorillas stand in several rows, growing about two miles [2 km].
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Vaznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from South Ukraine to the international highway.
The goods are sent from here to the Stavropolsk region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Wednesday, before midnight, they were released, and after these rules were put in place, a lawyer named Alexei Golovanov (on the photo), who was taking transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and was already in his car for almost a week.
Under new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance they carry.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 to 5,000 rubles (about 1100 to 1300 g.).
Those who eat near (in Georgia, Armenia) at a price of up to $50,000 pay a thousand rubles (3800 g) and travel.
And the rest of them were shot, and none of them had any more money!
Imagine if the driver takes the cargo at a total of four thousand dollars, but to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (about 23,000 gloves) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival on the border - none - are set by the dealers who are equipped with their cars.
In border stores and coffee and always expensive, but the prices, like here, we never met!
The sellers focused on them and quickly invited them: 15 grams of butter, seven grams of coffee, 25 grams of soup.
And the coffee one.
And there's no toilet.
I'm sleeping on the stairs, I'm going to the toilet.
We're gonna lie, we're gonna get...
I can't get out of the car for a week. I got a woman on my way.
A week later, he's comforted by another dormitory, Victor Scotarenko.
Will you just come to my car next week?
- We're interested in a single border store.
It's 11 and 15 grifts.
What, a bottle of crystal or water is standing on the siren?
We have coffee, not a store.
You know, until there's something else, the seller's paid off.
After the situation began to unfold in the media, the attention of the authorities of the region was drawn to the poor situation of Ukrainian leaders.
The leadership of the Ambrosian and Novosabad administrations had been instructed to ensure that everyone who lived around the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, had been entrusted with the responsibility of President Sergei Dergunov of the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Now, at the missed points, the brigades are exploding fast.
Biofuels will also be established for the benefit of people.
According to the official, the situation will be resolved in the near future.
As reported by the Press Service of the Danish Ministry of Debt, 32 and 68 cars were distributed at international crossing points in Spain and Novosovassk on 31 October respectively.
The Facts will follow the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in attempting to challenge the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to conduct information prosecutions against seniors of Lithuania and Eastern Partnership countries, such a statement was made by the BNS agency in the Department of the Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow, in particular, is going to “send” the President of Lithuania Dalau Gribouscaite and publish the falsified documents found in the Russian Gosarhi, which relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader’s biographies.
According to these services, the Department of Information Attack is conducting an analysis of the public processes of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenko, who has not visited Lithuania and participated in the Lithuanian People's Party.
He was also an officer of Department of Operation V. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Siminov had regularly visited Lithuania by the end of 2012 and had contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Siminov is now banned from entering the territory of the country.
The President of Lithuania Gribouskayt said that he knew about the information being prepared for her.
In her view, the main reason was the successful Presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the country ' s "streaming to energy independence "
The Lithuanian leader did not criticize the actions of the Russian authorities at the same time.
She thus stated that in Cremlé to Lithuania there was "insufficient respect".
In addition, Gribauskaite accused the head of the RF Vladimira Putin of "just a few demands" to Lithuania.
We remember that in September Rossotrabbnadsor stopped imports of Lithuanian mollusks into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product was not in conformity with the health and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that, if Russia did not remove the ban, the Government of the country should prepare treatment to the WTO.
In the United States, the school director shot adults.
The director of one of the American secondary schools of youth literally led to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take the weapon and start shooting.
An incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, the young hooligans had stolen the man’s house from the toilet.
As a result, the school director opened up an adult shoot, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
As the prosecutors were not in the property of the Director, he was accused of an attack under the circumstances.
The men were released from prison at $125,000.
On the contrary, the strike in the United States of America has become a terrible legal offence.
A man’s literal enthusiasm opened the fire at the center of the city of Ridgekrest in California, U.S.A., right along the street.
After that, the offender was arrested in the custody of two dangerous passengers, dragged them into the car trunk, and tried to hide.
Previously, the first school in the city of Newton, Connecticut, had opened fire.
At school, Adam's mother worked, and she was a teacher.
Shooting in American School: A 14-year-old girl injured
An incident with the shooting took place on 31 January in the American school, for the first time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a pedagogist.
"Dinamo" organises free electricity for patients in Himki on the "Tomia" match.

As reported by the official website of the club, Dinamo-Tome, which will be held on 2 October at the Rodina Stadium in Himkah, the Moscow Club will organise free electricity for its patients.
It will be sent from the Leningrad Oxala at 14.38.

We remember that the "Dinamo" match begins on 2 November at 16 a.m. in Moscow time.
Sovsport.ru will carry his text transmission.
Halloween 2013
When I was a little boy, Halloween was a joke.
My sister and I were allowed to have a conference, not to sleep late, and to cut off a mask for our area.
Now I look more like a pig.
I haven't been able to give a conference in my apartment in the last two years and, rather, I'm not going to be here this year.
Statistics show, however, that I am a white warrior in the matter of Halloween.
According to the National Trade Federation, the majority of Americans, or 158 million, will celebrate Halloween this year and spend $6.9 billion on concerts, costumes and funerals.
The only thing I'm looking for every Halloween is moments.
The national trade union predicts that $1.2 billion will be spent on costumes.
In this year, the fashions are sexually unhappy items.
Women are no longer required to be representatives of sexual professions; they may also be sexually gay, such as pikes, hamburgers or skunks.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the deaths, and I'm sure the cosmonauts in the Daft Punk group will fall in our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes that look most often are zombies, Batman, pirates, and wolves.
Please, there's nothing bad in the traditional way.
We made our horses last year, and to my surprise, we were not alone.
Moreover, according to the National Trade Federation, the United States will spend $330 million on pets this year.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When the case comes to the conference, we don't worry.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, milk-duds confectionery, Twizzlers and Clark Bar batons.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Trade, these are excellent news for 41 million children who are ready to obey our regions.
Moreover, we buy and not deceive ourselves — we spend 90 million pounds of chocolate in the time of Halloween.
The only thing we do not want to use is the confederates in the form of corn seeds; however, according to the National Association of Condicators, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Hellouin.
It's about 9 billion of individual cucumbers.
It's an order I still have to talk about.
Nothing is like Halloween, like a house with visions.
They have names, such as "Water of the Walls" (which are found in this prison), "Wow and Crick" and "Dom shock".
Moreover, according to American Hunts society, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses with views that generate about $500 million in revenue, as well as the touching photographs that you have almost described, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like, sees this photo and leaves comments like "class expression of the person".
And finally we're talking about teasing.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Tower when we were children, and the appearance of Jack’s light is like the crown of a birth cell, what we do with the baby.
Happily for us, the fashion of a child in a tent began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up to wear those glasses, not to sit in them.
According to the U.S. census office, the United States will spend about $106 million on tobacco this year.
The lightmaker Jack, who slowly stretched out on your wing, probably came from Illinois, who had grown 542 million pounds this year.
If you want more complex tasks, contact Tim and Susan Metisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to get some of their uncle's weight out of 2032 pounds.
The Minboron website of Estonia was restored after the Ukrainian hackers attacked
The work of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia's website was restored after yesterday's cyberattack, reports the press office.
According to the Minoboron Deputy Chancellor on Information and Administration issues, it was a primitive attack, just overloading a large number of requests.
Our specialists have made everything quickly, so far the site's work has been restored.
"The Ministry's alleged damage is minimal," said Petercop in Postimees.
According to Peterkopa, it's early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We are obliged to analyse the causes of the incident and make our own conclusions, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents," he acknowledged.
On 1 November, Anonymous Ukraine group posted a network of treatment that confirmed the hacking attack on the website of Minoboron Estonia and against Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO's servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine is not required in the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia, either.
Ukraine should not be a slave.
We speak for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands from Ukraine," said Anonymous.
Formerly, Minboron Ukraine reported that the mouth of the Pacific Ocean Battalion of the Pacific Ocean would be involved in the command-line lessons of NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 response force.
Because of the fear of the unclean forces, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's province of South Matabeleland were closed because the students were attacked by... Goblin.
As the local elder said, the children had fallen into a panic, and it was impossible to continue.
The Goblins report may sound like a child's idea to a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In the summer, for example, the hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because the hospital was also attacked by the Goblins.
Announced on the launch of the Land Rover race
There are front-end seatings and six-wheel security belts, as well as the internal communications system.
In addition, modernized brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works, logistical support and maintenance of a car between activities can be obtained.
Dr. Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The speakers calling at Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced runners, but people who are searching for fame, conclusions and access to the world class.
We are pleased to propose such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different ral disciplines in Great Britain and beyond, as well as to prepare participants to the difficult conditions and realities of ralley-Rayda.
We were very pleased with the design of the Defender Challenge car — a truly exciting champion.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for training and testing as well as for participation in activities in the desert in North Africa and in the Middle East.
Russian forces are unaware of the Grouping of the Brethren - New News
INTERFAX.RU is a reference to an information source in the law enforcement bodies of the RF.
"After reports of the Ministry of Finance of the United States of Lepsa had been made in the media on the list of suspects belonging to the Euro-Mediterranean Criminal Syndicate, we examined all the databases, but none of the groups had been found," said the agency's associate.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which is now abroad.
As previously stated, the US Ministry of Finance has published a list of alleged members of the “British Round” criminal group on its website yesterday.
Among them was also the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He's depicted in the list as "Grish", and he's being pressured.
They match the figures of the popular Russian executive.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevride, the creative pseudonym, the place and date of birth.
In addition to Lepsa, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another ex-SCR outlaw, whose nationality was not indicated.
In the United States, Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, was convinced that he was carrying money for the bandits on their orders.
The report is accompanied by a photo of the dog and shows all its data that are relevant to the facts.
More than that, Leps really bought a house in Phukette recently.
The Bureau noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Lepsa.
The blacklisting of the American Minfina will lead to the blockade of its assets in the United States and prohibit the business contacts of those living in the United States.
Assistant Lepsa Maya Sericova said that no notifications were received: "It was difficult to answer the question whether it was Gregory who is now speaking about a scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media information.
He had no personal reports, although I don't know if they were in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, amazing and unexpected," she said RIA News.
According to her, it doesn't live on Phuket Grigory Leps, but, as Minfin claims, there's really a house on the Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long trip to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news stopped him during his flight to the city of Blagastensk.
A fugitive on the field in Shinnik's mat.
There were some details of the personality of the fan who escaped in the field during the match 1/16 of Cuba Russia between the Rosarios Sinnik and the Moscow Spartacus.
According to the head of the CDC RFS, Arthur Grigorianz, referring to the MDG data, this patient is a Muslim.
At this point, he was detained.
"In addition to this, Gregoriant told about how the fantasty was able to go into the field: "It was clear that this, by his name, the viewer, had come to the rescue of the two spectators, referring to problems with the heart.
He came to help quickly. He confirmed the doctor's quick.
Then he pulled away the two pursuers and ran into the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South Court to the corner of the East and North Court.
He ran through the whole field.
That's what the Stuarts are responsible for.
Before the law on sport entered into force, this area of the work of the stadiums - the police cannot interfere with what is in the field.
He got to the tribunal, passing through the Eastern tribunal.
And at that time there was a setback on the East Coast and on the escape roads," the head of the CDC said.
We remember that the Moscow Spartacus decision will be carried out without prejudice to the upcoming 15th anniversary of the Russian campaign against Locomoty and Zenita, and will also pay the fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire forces were launched to rescue the wounded prisoner who shot 50 feet above the ground for dangerous entry into the career
Cocker Spaniard Ruby escaped after she fell into the small TTP.
Three days later, she was shot in a career, and she noticed a man who had shot a dog.
The fires were thrown into a hole on the ground to save the dog from the unremitting slaughter
She was happy to escape after the fire squads had been launched to raise her and deliver her to a safe place, after she somehow shot 50 feet at the risk of accessing her back.
The nine-month spaceman Ruby fled after she fell into a car accident on the day of her resurrection and spent three days in solitary confinement before she was saved from a career in the middle.
Her partner, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were in the Floppet career in Denholm, West York, to join Ruby and thank the West York Fire and Rescue Service.
They deliberately sought their missing dog and placed treatment on social networks after she ran out of school after a minor accident.
About 14:15 in the middle of the starboard, Rubi noticed a 50-foot stop in the career.
The technical rescue team from Clekhiton's fire station rushed down to the scene, jumped down to rescue Ruby, and used the transfer to lift her up onto the roof.
“She was in a dangerous situation”, said rescue officer Andy Clayton.
It was right in the middle of the ledge — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move the muscle during the rescue, she was completely paralyzed.
But now she's fine.
And then she came to the bed.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog's noticed is incredible.
An officer of the rescue team, Peter Lau, said: "The thief was very angry that she was saved."
It was likely that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were sent to the veterinarian for inspection, and it was established that everything was in order, except for heating and cooling.
Ms. Hall of Galifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Looking at salvation was terrible."
I couldn't believe she was there.
It was touching when she came back to us.
The veterinarian said that if she was obsessed and lost consciousness, she would almost fall asleep.
The fires were huge.
It was very brave — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each one of them has been absolutely boring.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she remained there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mike Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview at the Australian radio station this week, the pop-star said that she was a skee-vocalist for the 2004 Jaguar song Old Habits die hard.
Perry said that she had been dating a vet, and she said, "He played with me when I was 18. "
She added, "It was a very long time, and he was very good."
In a fourth statement, the representative of seventy-year-old Jagger said that he “categorizedly denied that he had ever been hurt by Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “Maybe she will travel with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new Prism album was deputised on the first place this week.
George Crevan: Breaking up with Europe gives a Scottish election
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that the independent Scotland will have to join the single European free movement zone as a condition for membership in the EU.
It's going through the history of passport control in Bervik and the border with a wheeled passerby down Adrian's valley.
True, Strathclyde’s newspaper pointed out the possible economic benefits from the more free movement of the rest of Europe, although it was not expected that this would be in the headlines.
No one has also indicated that EU Member States are spending too much time in order to break their formal rules as it is convenient for them.
Since Scotland is no longer part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance with the requirements will be a valid excuse for Brussels instead of what it really wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's not worth the attention of history.
And so old that she turned into a omelet: I first heard the "outkey" that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment that has been lost in the transfer of the old story.
Why should the completely independent Scotland comply with Europe's orders?
Why would London's brand change to Brussels's brand, especially now?
Here are the following European news: the great afternoon plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With the crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, the parties against the EU or for the withdrawal of the euro as a single currency shall take power.
Even in Germany, a Eurosceptical Party of Alternatives for Germany, which was founded only this year, emerged from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus putting the Free Democrats out of Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the Federal Europe's establishment plan.
However, the current economic crisis has become a nightmare.
The harsh economic measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the eyes imposed on national economies by maintaining a single currency have led many to the view that Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are working at excessive budget deficits, which was just for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members from exchange courses that are beneficial to German exporters — that German policies and wishes to be maintained.
As far as national currency is concerned, South Europe is in the pre-favourable situation compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to reduce payments and government costs, which are actively supported by Berlin.
The issue of the current budget and currency is a deeper issue of Europe's production capacity.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a figure that represents the subsidisation of French and German energy companies through the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as in the United States.
It's comparable to the unpleasant price conditions we've seen in Greenjmote.
No pollution in the world will continue to be a devastating victory of the U.S. solar gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, there was a rebellion, especially in France, when the EU's most broad side was at one time.
After the war, the French political elite looked at the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at the same level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe by leaving France's economy in a state of poverty.
As a result, the law against the EU Marin Le Pen National Front has only won the decisive additional elections and has thrown the ruling party of the Socialists into third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent vote, a timely warning to British Liberians that it cannot be ruled out by the assumption that the right-of-occupancy is automatically said for the benefit of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly created popularity among the French white working class?
It would like to use EU elections next year to create a blockage in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If, and most likely, the EU party will be supported by these elections, such a block will be able to take the dominant position first in the European Parliament.
I think that the growing attitudes against the EU and the single currency in Europe are united to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become a kind of scattered "European (Sovereign) nations", which has liked the General de Goll.
Germany and some of its economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I believe that Britain will be away from this project, hoping to draw close to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific points to the possibility that Britain will remain unattended in the Atlantic Ocean.
What situation does it leave Scotland?
We can choose to be (in fact) a region of small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, in addition to sending Berlin and Brussels to the streets.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to overcome within the framework of a more free European agreement, provided that we will maintain our currency.
Cooperation with other unilateral countries will be just in the non-federal nations of Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of restoring Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of Scotland's National Party in Scotland is, as it were, the most successful political movement in Europe, aimed at serious economic measures, which were received by the majority of votes in 2011, thanks to the opposition to the reduction of the costs proposed (and realized) by the Liberian Chancellor of the character of Alister Darling and followed by the coalition of Turks and Liberal Democrats.
It would now be inappropriate for Scotland to vote in favour of independence only in order to take action against the harsh economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sex education: old age
African and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts are doing research.
Physical changes do not mean that sex is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe that the epidemic of pregnancy may be one of the first-class sexual harassment mechanisms
The trend towards early sex is not so pronounced in boys
Former correspondent for CNN Pet Etridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family matters.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop breast cancer and breast cancer at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in the Netherlands, Florida, Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes were sufficiently distributed among American girls and are a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time with calming parents, which usually doesn’t mean a fast coming to full sex age,” said Kaplovitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, lipsticks, and body hair, appear earlier to the girl.
But there was only a small amount of manarche (first Ministerial Training) in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and was reduced from 12.75 in 1970.
“After breast development, at least two and a half years before the manarche,” said Caplovitz, also the author of the book “The Early Sexual Harassment of a Girl: How to deal with this widespread problem”.
Time is the most accurate check of how sexual harassment will progress.
The discussion is based on the fact that it is an actual occurrence of sexual maturity, but it is considered “an early age”, when breast growth is accompanied by a rapid increase in growth of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will be slowed down or stopped — that is, the pediatric may be closely monitored.
More rapid progress may be a basis for endocrineology analysis to address serious problems such as nausea or vomiting.
There are procedures to stop early depression and prevent further effects: premature aging of bones, which may eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in adults.
Recommendations on medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the pace of growth and emotional growth.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The capillary is careful with drugs, but recognizes that “sex pressure can reduce behavioral problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from adolescents”.
Another major problem is that parents simply don’t want their young daughters to be subjected to the stress.
“They are concerned about the risks of pregnancy or even about how they deal with hygiene,” Caplovitz said.
“It was a shock, ” recalled one woman whose daughter started the ministry at 10 years of age.
Although there were signs and we were talking about Mentura, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school terrified and frustrated that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early sexual harassment.
However, there is no consistent evidence that lead hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys — and girls — have sex before.
Caplovitz claims that the premise that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of aging.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of a girl from 6 to 9 years of age, which linked the number of living in an institution to a period of sexual harassment.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African and Latin American girls usually achieve sex earlier than their white girls.
There are various reasons.
Throughout the world, pre-sex sex education has the potential to affect everything: economic conditions and climate to gender.
Another warning: Although male hair on the face and on the back of the neck appears younger, the trend towards full early sexual development is not as clear as that of a girl.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the subject.
The presence of male and female hair is seen even among young people and children of age.
“We must be careful about how we define the real future of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child nurse at Gorieb’s child hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive guidance from the pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean earlier than expected,” Caplovitz explained.
If you keep calm, your child usually reacts well.
Girls who develop early need to confirm that even when this happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
Killed in China, U.S. Boeing is ready for departure.
The open-air observers over the territory of Russia and the unplanned landing of the United States aircraft on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m., will be left by the city.
The airport’s leadership allowed the ship to land and received fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the airport will be located in Ulan-Ude.
In other words, he'll be sent to the United States.
As reported, Ulan-Udé's plane landed in the Zabakal region because of a crash.
He was not released from the State Airport because of the unpaid accounts.
There are 30 persons on board, including a crew, who spent two nights on the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in the IDF, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to leave beyond the airport of Reada, they can only cross border control in two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulan Udé.
The open heaven treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating in it.
Observer flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and the countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are transparency, monitoring of arms control agreements, enhancing crisis prevention and crisis resolution within the OSCE and other international organizations.
As long as the rest of the signatories are working - the IC in the United States of America
The highest income rating of the living population in 2013 was directed by Madonna, which earned $125 million.
However, it was "performed" by late Michael Jackson, whose deaths from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
It is noteworthy that other survivors of signism who have "worked" several times in the past year have not been able to do so.
The second of the list of the most "sustainable" enthusiasts, produced by Forbes magazine for the year, was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the comic book Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, former leader of the past year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.

I'm sure the most beautiful girls in Russia live.
That's why I'm especially glad I've got a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's what Igora broke out of a beautiful tape and invited all who wanted to... to model the looking models!
Manufacturers of reactive aircraft are impressed by the width of the seat when large orders are made on the horse
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a heated dispute over the spread of the tourist class seats on the further voyages, with a tone for a heated confrontation at the Dubai aviation exhibition this month.
The platform will be surrounded by a wide range of seats provided for the long-term tour of the economic-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the attention of the airlines, since the amount allocated to them by the space plays a key role in the approvals of the effectiveness of the latest aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus called this week for the introduction of a sectoral standard, which would provide for a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the economic-class halls, but her major American competitor Boeing said that this should be done by the airline.
The delay will take place when aircraft manufacturers collect more and more large versions of their two-engine-powered aircraft and potential recording orders are expected to be issued on 17-21 November.
The composition of the rear part of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 persons are in a row, is central to the economic efficiency of the new “aerospace” projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will include 406 persons, from the seats in the economic class of more than 17 holes in the width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 would carry 350 people to the economic class at the seats of a wide range of 18 debts, which were set at nine in a row.
Aircraft giants are often replaced by technical attacks with advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is being called directly to the public before the plane in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what might be the start of a new advertising war, showing the financiers depicting three people in the restaurant who were attracted to each other by the title “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers further master flights in seats of more expensive than in regional turbulence aircraft,” said Airbus leader John Lihi.
By changing food rations, people pick a bag, but the air seats did not change cardinally.
Between the early 1970s, when extensive Boeing 747 reached the standards of contemporary travel, and the average American men age from 40 to 49 grew by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The average American men's salary of the 21st century is 39.7 dollars, based on US health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor holds the concept of the 1950s, when the average size of the talents of those who have recently called the “reactive public”, has already been.
Airbus says that a study has been commissioned to show that an additional drop in the seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing challenged the Airbus figures on the size of the seats and said that manufacturers should not intervene in the decision of airlines to find a balance between tariffs and facilities.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
“In fact, it is all about providing airlines with the choice and opportunity to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said expert Boeing on the Kent Creaver Salons.
They don't want us to decide for them what's going to bring them.
They know their job better than anyone else.
The issue for passengers is to increase side space, but for suppliers it is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
The dispute is based on orders for aircraft estimated at least $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decade — enough to change the relationship between American and European exports.
As reported earlier in July by Reyter, the presence of seats is what fosters the conflict between new reactive aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profits in one place in their latest two-engine long-range models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365 Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared characteristics of Boeing are partly based on the comparison of 10 local rows 777X with the original 9 local components of the constructive decision 777.
The benefits are reduced individually compared to the 10 local components currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to force more space and make its aircraft more competitive than our development,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that halls with a total of 10 local rows for existing 777 indicate that many passengers prefer a flat roof that can be handy with lower tariffs.
“The seven-and-a-half of the 18-day rounds would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal is commercially a threat to the 777 model,” said Dr. Mary Kirby, founder and editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide a race, but they offer a directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
In the world, active aircraft vendors even drive their wheels to check competitive planning.
In the light of the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very flat-room composition for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 locals, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional changes to the rooms, offering more space to pass on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, as experts say, its call to the new sectoral standard may be "extended", but may draw attention to the volume of sales of model 777X.
A new anticancer vaccine may interfere with the process of smoking satisfaction
Scientists have developed an anti-cancer vaccine that could hinder the smoking of a cigarette of pleasure.
One dose of vaccines has been able to protect birds from nicotine dependence for the rest of their lives.
There is a need for further testing prior to the start of human testing, but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York Medical College Will Cornell said that the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy may finally help millions of smokers who have tried to break up, tested all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern resources,” said Professor Cornel.
The new vaccine contains an invaluable virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the production of anticancer antibodies.
The virus is selectively infecting the cells that then start producing a stable antithesis flow.
Antithetylated any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the use of nicotine smoker.
In the tests, infected mice, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued their normal activity.
But those who did not give the vaccine were so weak-hearted, and that is because they had reached their brains that researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contain antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, schools had to be done so often that they were expensive and unactual.
But the value of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns oil cells into antidepressants.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette that prevents nicotine dependence.
But it's more likely that it's going to use smokers to burn.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't get any satisfaction from this because of nicotine, and that can help them get out of this habit," he said.
The British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned that additional studies were needed.
Oilsmen: Third rural settlements in the South Pacific
Deputy Governor of Podmoskoj Yuri Olynikov stated that almost three rural areas of the Moscow area were wholly adjacent
The total allocation from the budget of the region is 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received allocations from the area budget.
The share of grants in the budget of 122 rural areas exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of the grant.
As part of the budgetary security of the area budget, some 25 billion rubles are delivered," Olyaniko said.
The Deputy Governor also noted that there are only three urban settlements - Witish, Onezovo and Puskino - more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of the rurals in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "that's not enough."
The cost of holding a local administrative unit in the 88 submunitions is over 70 per cent, while “a decrease in service quality” is observed, Olyanikov noted.
He had previously instructed the heads of municipal education in Podmoskoja until the end of November to consider what housing needs to be increased, integrated into the urban area or change of the administration system.
These proposals will be launched by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of the region of Moscow had stated that administrative reforms in the subregion were planned to reduce the number of rural settlements.
There is also a call for the expansion of municipalities in the Mojay, Cashier, Sunni, Colummens, Luberca and Côtelnik.
The debate on this issue began in the cities and regions of the region in November.
The President of Mosleduma Igor Brancalov also stated that the entire integration of the coming demolition is planned for about 30 rural settlements in the 12 areas of Podmoskoja.
This is related to the fact that, from 178 rural areas in the Netherlands, less than three have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 are additional.
Diana Arbenina has abandoned Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great satisfaction she receives from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenina is now giving too much time to creativity and public activity, she still has the opportunity to ride with Marto and Artem, not only to spend time in their training but also to enjoy as much as she can.
The last week, Diana twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she's been bluffing the fans, showing how she made Artema and Martu in Hellouin.
Our first halloween" was called Diana's photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Whatever the case, they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have a relationship with this holiday since they were born in America.
First Germany in Europe introduces "undefined sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate "undefined" instead of male or female sex at birth.
The child’s parents will have the right to leave the pool on time to witness the birth of an unaccompanied child.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male gender) parents can write "H" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at preventing parents from interrupting the sex "off" operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hemorrhoids.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeda
Former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be the investigator of the anti-corruption oversight body of the state.
Former Minister of the New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, was examining changes in the lease of primorial objects at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeda, who had a secret share of three State-owned property.
The Independent Counter-Corruption Commission (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday whether Mr. Obeid had authorized several ministers of the state to extend the lease contracts to Cerkülar Ki, where the family of Obeidud belonged to two restaurants and coffee, without a tendering period after the expiry of their operation in August 2005.
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeda's secret participation in the non-movable facilities, after showing that Mr. Tripodi Lin Espoul had been appointed Deputy Chief of Administration on Thursday.
During the several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be awarded to open competition.
The contractors were opposed to this, as well as wished for longer duration of the lease.
In 2009, the lease agreements at Cerkülar Ki, which brought to the family of Obeidov about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially spoke for open competition.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeda, who, as Mr. Tripodi had acknowledged, had urged him to make changes in the government ' s leased policy.
The IAC's signature of the telephone talks took place in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obed, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, the senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the direction of Mr. Obeda in the Fisheries Division.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephony discussions on the development of commercial lease policy?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willi Tripodi, assistant.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli military aircraft attacked the targets inside Syria
The senior administrative officer in Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft had been attacked for the purpose of the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The prosecutor did not explain that it was intended, but said that at least one.
Assassheyted Press reports that the target was the Russian production rocket SA-125.
At least two times this year, Israel carried cargo aircraft with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers may be tested for “study”
The “substantial” test for foreign workers under Class 457 visas is under Government review, as it aims to increase repression.
This test, if adopted, will be applied to the criteria for preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified posts or as a guide for family and friends in Australia.
A document submitted by the Government to the discussion was published today, while former Liberian delegation, Maxine McKyu, criticised the Government ' s accountability for foreign workers, saying that it could be tried by the neighbours of Australia.
“The gross statements of the type "foreigners, at the end of the round" and "the beginning of the work of Australians" are a very unpleasant waste until trade unions called for a protected labour market," she said to Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected — and if some in the region had seen the roots of this historic artifact, I would not have been surprised.
The document presented to the discussion outlined 12 measures previously taken by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, met with officials on the subject of human trafficking, had already made five of the recommended changes, while the others were in the course of consideration.
If the criteria for “substantiation” are adopted, the applicant may study whether “the applicant is a valid candidate under conditions where the candidate is a relative or a close relative of the owner or person with regard to the financing of the undertaking”.
Businesses may also need to be accounted for by the number of visa holders of the 457 sub-classes, since companies that were planning to sponsor a small number of workers were then taken into office.
In the meantime, 35-year-old schri-lunkier who was looking for refuge died unexpectedly from infarct after arriving on a boat with the refugees on the island of Christmas this week.
The victim's nine-year-old son was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and from the time of his father's death, he was supported by a brother who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities quickly sent a man to the Christmas Island hospital where he died.
Another Seed Varlamova said that hockeys suffer from alcoholism
Another hockeyist, Semena Varlamova Evgenie Varrinuk, said that he suffered alcoholism, transmitted to the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," she said, in particular, a woman.
We remember that Vavrinuk brought a trial for the murder of a Russian gatherer, Semena Varlamova, also a member of the Colorado Club.
In her words, a hockeyist beat her for hair and killed her after she was attacked by her hands, breasts, life and shee.
Varlamov himself came to the dentist's police and admitted to the murder, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released at $5,000.
The court did not restrict sportsmen in the country's movements, but prevented them from approaching Vourinuk.
He is also under threat of imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The Government of Great Britain announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact of Scotland on the project of the HS2 Railway Master.
Draft HS2 proposes the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
Minister for Transport of Baronness Kramer noted that the project "United Kingdom".
The Minister for Transport of Scotland Kit Brown said that he was "in the autumn" from the prospects of work on the plan with the Government of Great Britain.
The first stage will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Step is completed, the lines will be lined up in Manchester and Lids.
In June the Government revised the estimated cost of high-speed construction between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The Government of Great Britain, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the transit capacity of the railway and to reduce the length of travel for North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the way from Glazgo and Edinburgh to London within three hours or less.
Baronness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a current national network that makes Great Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we will face a crisis of passage capacity in our railway network.
But it is also about the transport of cities with one another; 18 cities throughout Great Britain, including Glazgo and Edinburgh, will receive a better message thanks to HS2.
“Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland, ” added Scottish Prime Minister Alister Carmekel.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmela to support the integration of Scotland into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed rail road has every opportunity to bring great economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the Scottish economic news to the general argument on the high-speed rail road throughout Britain.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the Government of Great Britain to consider the options for the construction of high-speed railways in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glazgo - Edinburgh railway line, which is already planned by the Scottish Government.
I continue to wish to review the results of the studies with the British Ministers in the following year and to take a joint decision on the following steps.
Toriy is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Hydrocarbon emissions (where they are) have a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is spent on nothing else but leaves behind the mass of roads in the distillation of waste.
Recently, scientists have focused on the tower - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is being met throughout the world and, as experts say, its destruction does not leave the waste that has to be stored for centuries.
The rules for the use of electronic devices at the courts in Australia until they are in force
Travellers of Australia's airlines will need to continue to exclude their plans and smartphones during flight and landing, despite United States mitigation measures.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch video or play games on their devices during flight and landing, provided they remain in the "Aeroplane Range".
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many suspect that they do not have access to their e-books at the time of departure and landing.
Australian carriers considered this decision, which required American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they considered this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“The Administration of Civil Aviation Safety does not currently have special rules governing the use of electronic aircraft,” she said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety rules notified to them by crew members.
The company Virginia, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office on the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to changes, but stated that it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of authorisation of electronic devices, because we really think that it will improve the quality of customer service now when it (the unmanned entertainment system) is on our planes,” the press secretary said.
Kandas stated that the current rules would be maintained.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during flight and landing, and we are not planning to change them in the near future,” she said.
The FAO Regulation is distributed to the American airline.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in the regular changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully examine the FAU decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Transporters will have to demonstrate that their aircraft are able to maintain radio memory from mobile devices, as well as to review the benefits, training materials, manual storage standards and passenger instruction.
“After the airline will verify and confirm the compatibility of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronics such as planes, electronic books and smartphones at any level,” FAO stated.
In rare cases, poor visibility of the crew will give passengers instructions to remove their equipment during landing.
In addition, the Panel recommended that more heavy equipment should be placed under seats or in upper bulkheads at the time of departure and landing.
Heads of Dagestan are heard in the Cuban tree of extremism
The football match between Angie and Cuba took place in a political coalition between the authorities of Krasnodar and Dagestan, after the patients had crossed the Dagestian flag, and the Cuban team called for another one.
The head of Dagestan Ramasan Abdulatapov on Thursday proposed to the Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court, as the game of the Krasnodar end of Cuba calls for an international difference, in particular calling for the war against the Basurmans.
In 1995 it was adopted by the Red Cross.
It's the same thing, and no one cares.
"Of you here, remembering the mother of a relative, an enemy, we are going to a death battle" - why such words are recorded in the gym, to hurt some believers at other believers," he expressed solidarity with the President of the Parliament, Hizri Shissaid.
Putin received no punishment for his friend Assad
And now, news from the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has been attacked by Russian production rockets, which, according to reports, was called Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important requirement to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of the agreement reached by Russia and the United States that allowed them to refrain from carrying out a military operation that they had suddenly arrived this summer.
More details on weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will be discussed by our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington said that the Assad regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 peaceful residents, including hundreds of children, were killed in August of the greenhouse gas.
And the punishment came.
But not like American bombers, but like a deal made by a friend of Asada-Vladimir Putin.
Syria withdrew from its chemical weapons to the middle of the following year.
And today is an important occasion.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had withdrawn from the construction of the alleged arms production factories.
The longer and heavy task is the destruction of the tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we can see, it's about a thousand tons.
Previously on Washington, he said Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether this happens, but when it happens.
He's no longer legitimate and he should go.
But Assad remains.
And he feels more confident.
His army continues to use artillery, rockets and fire.
His opponents are spread and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many hunger.
Some have to ask for letters and cards.
Many believe that Basar Assad has avoided the punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement calls for the success of diplomacy, the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to inspectors, and Assad itself has produced an impression of human cooperation.
Today, the United States Ambassador to Syria has had to answer simple questions.
When the child moves from hunger, his mother is less likely to kill him with chemical weapons.
Assad's still standing.
And he's changing weapons to power.
The President of the RFF established a separate Ministry of Construction and HCH
President Vladimir Putin of Russia established a new Ministry of Construction and HCH and proposed that his ex-government in the Ivano region lead Michael Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Michael Menem in his residence in New York, and I did not refuse to take the lead in the new press.
The Press Secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all building and HCH functions are transferred to a new Ministry of the Interior.
Michael Mena is the son of a well-known Orthodox priest, Alexander Mena, who has graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum, named Gubkina.
Since 1995, his political career has begun - he has been elected in the Moscow area from the Sergei-Posada region, a member of the State Duma, the first vice-president of the Government of the region of Moscow, the vice-president of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menh was governor of the Ivano region.
The owners of the Lombars in Singapore are going well while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In Lombarde, Bendemir Trade Center in Singapore, Janny Amirhaling is a gold necklace, knife, and string to pay for her daughter's school education.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put there," said Mrs. Amirhaling.
Although she and S$3,000 ($2400) work monthly as an administrator and her husband also work, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the question in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is growing, is that ValueMax, where it is engaged, became the third lobby registered in the Singapore fund.
The credit is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirhaling), but it is almost the same as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, lombars usually account for an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent — almost 15.4% of the United Overseas Bank, the local creditor with the branch in the same trading center.
However, the Lombars have the advantage that they do not require verification of the credit capacity or evidence of the payment and can issue credit faster than the bank.
As a result, millions of people throughout the region are being called into labor camps, as families feel pressure because of increasing the cost of life and the rapid increase in household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the global financial crisis, and cash credits for free-credit policies in developing countries, families with low and middle-income economies are sought to compensate for the decrease in income by slowing their economies.
This week the Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated the increase in the family credit rate, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' credit capacity.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt ratio in Asia.
Malaysia led this list from 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which had barely emerged this week from technical recovery.
The fourth data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“In the morning, people in the middle and lower [income levels] will seek ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Song Sing Won, a CIMB economist, Malaysian bank.
The record of high gold prices in the last two years has made it possible for people to borrow their personal things, as they use the opportunity to earn money for their families.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the materials stored in 200 city halls are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold is good. Let's get a golden cup of it and let's get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of EasyMoney Lombars has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
The growth in the Lombar business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in nearby Malaysia, but also beyond Asia, says Jehuh Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an increase of 60 per cent from S$66 million this week, resulting in the deployment of shares at the Singapore fund base.
While some creditors caused fires due to high rates of criticism, Ms. Jehuh said that Lombard did not only offer lower rates than other creditors, nor did it increase the debt directly.
“Clients are holding the items they already own, and the monitoring of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The facility provides greater public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term funding.
And the lombars are not the only categories of people in a difficult financial situation.
The wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, which store the gold rings or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase price.
We see clients from all over society.
“They include individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small-scale businesses who need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money too fast.
Today, the number and status of available medical institutions is not important for the population, but the quality of medical assistance.
The implementation of the programme “Modernization of Health in the Tull Area 2011-2013”, the reorganization of the media of our city will allow the development of an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological, pregnant and pregnant women.
Yes, after association with the miner, there was an even greater possibility of attracting senior GUZ NHKB specialists to consult with various pathologists, conducting additional hospital-based studies.
During the implementation of the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the home had been significantly improved, and modern equipment, corresponding to world standards, appeared.
Over the years, about 8 million rubles have been allocated to the capital building, with 112 units of equipment worth 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment has an intensive post for newborns.
In the operation of the casserole, the cell-severe device is used to collect blood from the operational wound and, after special treatment, to restore it to its offspring by avoiding the flow of foreign blood.
Modern equipment also provides clinical-laboratory diagnostics.
In women ' s consultations, the electronic register is in place, and the introduction of the electronic maps and the history of patient diseases is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine provided an opportunity for the consultation of gynaecological patients, pregnant women, newborns and newborns with regional specialists.
The Chechens killed and stole 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The Czech clergy are arrested by the French police for suspecting in a series of attacks on prostitution.
The investigation has continued since March of this year.
About 60 women were petitioned for execution by the cascades.
It is reported that the gangs ordered prostitution in one of the Strasbourg hotels and then killed and captured them.
The head of the band was 27 years old before Chechny's former judge.
David Alaba, the Bavari Protector, became the best sportsman in Austria in 2013, reports the official Bundestrian website.
In this dispute, he interviewed representatives of winter sports that were traditionally becoming the best in the country.
Second, Colonel Marcel Hirsher took over, and thirdly, he was on the lakes with Gregor Schlirencair's trailer.
During the last 21st century, the Austrian Philippines-Nigerian origins helped their team win in the League of Championships, Championships and Cuba of Germany, as well as in the UEFA Summit.
The ex-wife Archavine breathes with actor André Chad
An ex-citizen citizen's footballist, Andrey Archavino, Julia Baranowski, is leaving with actor André Chad.
Julia breathes in Italy to an Attris Anastasia Traveler, her wife, Sergei Slavnovo, and actress Andrey Chadov.
Photos of the joint tunnels are published in the Instagram Anastasia Road.
It's not the first joint photo of Andrey and Julia.
On 5 October, the Travelling Party published a photo on which a couple were seated on the Finnish river coast in Komaravo.
In mid-October, the Zeneta Havebek, Andrey Arshawin, admitted that he lived separate from his civil wife, Julia.
I remember that Julia Baranowski and Andrey Archavin had three children since 2003.
It has recently been known that Archavin is meeting with the ex-model Alice Kazmin.
The new partner of Arkavina was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasman health
The Federal Government insists that the supply package of $325 million for the weakened health system of Tasmania will be complemented by strict conditions that ensure that the Government does not lose funds.
The Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plyberseck stated that the Company was taking “sustainable measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the higher level of chronic diseases and limitations of the system.
The financing decision was taken for four years after the Government consulted with the independent delegation of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
“The Government has proposed a package of extraordinary rescue measures, which we believe will solve specific problems facing the state,” said Mrs. Plyberseck today.
The package sized $325 million includes $31 million in the planning company.
Another 2600 operations, including sporadic and disaster relief operations, will help to overcome the delay.
There is also money for a clinic receiving patients without prior registration in Hobarte and London to improve the quality of care after the station, to train health professionals, to provide mental health services and to implement the systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will lead to the idea expressed by the top doctors of Tasmania’s health system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania would work in the strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to support the current level of funding in order to obtain the Society's financial resources and to take into account each month where it spends those additional resources.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and effective as possible.
Today, Mr. Wilki said that $325 million would not be resolved unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put the Tasman health system on a more sustainable basis.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his urgent request for assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the completion of this state’s health system in critical terms,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the Government, these additional electoral procedures significantly compensate for recent reductions.
However, the Federal Opposition Representative for Health Peter Datton believes that today's statement is “a solution similar to that of a doctor”.
“The reason why we are here is that the Government of Liberia has taken $430 million out of the health system,” he said on ABC TV.
When the government spends nearly half a billion dollars and the Company invests 300 million, it cannot be assumed that this is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The development of Giom Nicla Romana, Danny Didro, can be appreciated with exceptional determination and historical details, but it also finds it more difficult to understand what should be done.
A film that takes place in France in the 1760s tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to her family's monastery.
When she began to rebel, she experienced the extreme cruelty of her gardener and became the object of erotic fantasies for others.
Film is never released before sex or sensation — and this is the whole problem.
Because of its serious tenacity, the movement is likely to be tested by the type of owner and for the auditor.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production, said the observer group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and explosives with exhaust gas, declared in the fourth international monitoring group, while the shells were burning in the north, not far from one of the places where toxic substances were thought to be stored.
Also in the fourth Syrian activist group, more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
Statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
at the end of 1 November established by the Hague-based organization to destroy or “displace ineffective” Damascus all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow for the mixing of chemical substances with gas and to fill them with munitions.
The conclusion of the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious chart, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria is no longer able to produce a new chemical weapon.
Nevertheless, Damascus is still about to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
The country is estimated to have about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including greenhouse gas and nuclear-paralytic greenhouse gas.
This statement was made during the fourth battle in the city of Safira, where, according to experts, the chemical weapons production facility was located and its storage sites were reported by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights in Britain.
A group of activists, who had suffered loss through the network of activists in Syria, reported on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Basara Asada, 18,678 were government fighters and 187 Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, there were 2202 military refugees and some 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict has left about 2 million people to flee the country.
Asada's troops fought in Safar for several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that the victims were both victims on Thursday, but did not bring any specific data.
They highlighted the danger posed by the inspectors of chemical weapons that had been subjected to the short-term mission to rescue Syria from the toxic arsenal in the aftermath of the ongoing civil war.
The OZO statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its command was “now satisfied that it verified and saw all the critical means of production and equipment for mixing/recovery declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently being planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of verification, visiting 21 of 23 claimed entities in Damascus.
They couldn't visit two security stations, they told the inspectors.
In the fourth OZHO, it stated that both sites, according to the Syrian declaration, were “damaged and... the items of the chemical weapons programme contained in them have been transferred to other declared sites which have been verified”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the facility in Safire was one of two places that OZCO inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the WHO next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all displayed in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the Monitoring Group of Ahmed Uzumji in a comment published by the OZHO.
For the past three years, civil war has been facing rebels, mostly Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, who are members of its Al-Alavite sect, in response to Shiit Islam.
With regard to other events, Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Rami Centre, said that there was a strong explosion in the PWO facility in the coastal province of Latvia.
The reason is unknown, he said.
Anger on account of the arrest of the earth's organizers in Bali.
The survivors and relatives of 202 who were killed by the bomb explosion in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence brought by the last of the contractors before the court and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.
A passenger who spent nearly 10 years in refugee camps as one of the most researched people in Southeast Asia was sentenced to 20 years of deprivation of liberty for his role in the establishment of explosive devices used during the earthquake.
It may be released for 15 years if it is granted conditional-term release.
The 45-year-old judge was convicted of mass killings as a result of a two-night attack on two clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and ten more injured.
It was also recognized as responsible for a number of other charges of terrorism, including in the wild explosions of the whole of Indonesia in the Canary Islands in 2000.
The prosecutors needed a lifetime, although they could insist that a person called a “resident” should be sentenced to death by a master of the production of explosive devices.
This decision destroyed the painful memories of the mother of Perta John Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old daughter, Jane and Jenny in the trauma that Patek and his colleagues had experienced nearly ten years ago.
As soon as she could, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the steps of other guys.
He must stand before the firing squad, said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day, knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was brought into operation, which was placed in a parked furnace, immediately after 11 evening on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a terrorist killed a bomb that was fired 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma three times a month and died in a life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that the Patek should be divided into three other members of the Jama Islamist sect responsible for the blood war, Amrosi, Muhlas and Imma Samudri, who had been executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
Keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after 202 people were killed and hundreds were injured — that is not so much.
The trip is the last of the parties to the strike in Bali, before the court.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but at the end of January 2011, he was detained in the Pakistan City of Abbottbad, where the American army killed former head of Al-Qaida, Usam Ben Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent indicated that the investigation was evidenced: Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to restore relations between terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't come back," said Mrs. Cortin.
Before long, he did not regret the pain he caused to others.
The sentence was issued in advance of the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, which will be noted later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year will be very late," said Mrs. Cortin.
The train can still appeal to his sentence.
FAU: “Aeroplane passengers can now use aircraft rockets (not to call from a mobile phone)”
Aeroplanes can use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the long - term new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration.
However, passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as such a change will take place, depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Wart said at the press conference.
Air carriers should show FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guiding principles and that they update their training benefits for the members of the flight crew and the equipment board rules in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAO stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that already submitted plans.
“In terms of the state of the plan, we could agree to increase the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAO said.
At present passengers are obliged to turn off their smartphones, planes and other devices as soon as the airport door is closed.
They must not reboot until the aircraft reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain does not get "good".
Passengers must shut down their devices again when the aircraft is down for landing and not included until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices at the time of flight, landing and routing, the FAU said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes as expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleijding, President of the Association of Professional Shipowners, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been fully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier in order to achieve it), this will be an inexhaustible option”, Gleijding said.
We have openly stopped feeling “stupid at school” when the matter comes to an end.
The Agency, however, has reported that the Internet addiction, exchange of e-mails, text messages or uploading of data will be prohibited at least 10,000 feet.
Passengers will be proposed to switch their smartphones, planes and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no “Slov with friends” – an intellectual internet game in which actor Alec Baldwin played his smartphone in 2011 when the incident occurred: an actor was removed from the American Airlines airline by refusing to turn off the device when the aircraft was on the ground.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still need to be placed in the stock office, as they can harm anyone if they fly across the hall.
Cell phone calls in the field will also continue to be banned.
The Federal Commission on Communications, not the FAO, shall have regulatory power over telephone calls.
FAU may prohibit certain electronic devices during flight and landing
Last month, Mark Rozenker from the National Transport Safety Council, a national safety expert on CBS News, stated that hundreds of telephone calls are still considered risky.
“Telephones are a real problem, not only because they can create slots for navigational devices, but we know from the FCS that they can create slots for higher than a hundred connections when the plane is in the air,” Rozenker said.
The Industrial Advisory Committee established by the FAO to examine this issue recommended that the Government allow more use of personal electronic devices over the past month.
In recent years the pressure on FAU has increased to reduce its use.
Critics, such as Senator-Democrat of the state of Ms. Claire McCaskill, claim that there are no major security-related reasons for the bans.
The compliance with restrictions also becomes increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become universal.
Some studies show that up to three passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices passengers in 1966 in response to a communication on the exchanges for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM receivers — high-tech newspapers at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generation of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by the FAU as a sustainable electronic mix.
The airlines offer passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the creation site for several years.
Aircraft, modified for the Wi-Fi system, are also more sustainable to the mix.
The increasing majority of liners are equipped to use electronic devices more widely, according to the new guidelines, said Urta.
Today's electronic devices usually have a much lower power than the previous generation of devices.
e-books, for example, have only minimal signals when the page is rescinded.
But the signals become stronger when devices load or send data.
Among those who obtained mitigation restrictions on the use of electronic devices were Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company’s representatives loaded the entire aircraft with their devices to read and fly to see the problems, but did not find them.
The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAO expressed mixed feelings about whether or not the use of devices poses any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Association stated that it considers the movements of the devices to be real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots that confirmed that the devices could create slots for aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to request passengers to turn off the equipment during collection times under limited visibility.
The Group of Representatives of the Tourist Industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy approach to meeting passengers who are now using a number of technology devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dou, Director-General of the Tourist Association of the United States.
Cars can carry out examinations for driving rights
Driver rights exams can be adopted by private companies owned by their own computerized vehicle.
In this regard, the Commersant notes with reference to the draft Government ' s regulation on vehicle management.
According to the newspaper, there are now about 30 such automobiles in Russia.
It is expected that the results of internal testing will be calculated for students of such "priorized" vehicles.
In doing so, the Gosavton inspection will be conducted each year to monitor the performance of the examinations.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the students do not give them the first time, such a school will be deprived of long-term privileges.
The technical requirements for the authors contained in the draft Government decision shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also provides for training in dual-school technology.
Since 1 January 2015, the owner of category A rights motorcycles will be subject to examination under urban traffic.
In addition, companies will not be able to hire foreign leaders with foreign rights since 5 May 2014.
Such workers will have to get Russian rights after the examination.
A bird flying in a safe position with a bow in the North Sea is released back into the wild
The bird that was washed on the beach after being found in a dry condition on the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This waterbird was placed in a helicopter sent to Aberdeen last month and was released by the Scottish Community Office for the Prevention of Cruel Treatment of Animals (SPCA) at the Alloa Rescue Centre.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: “This waterway, most recently, is a winter migrants from North Europe, who fell into the atmosphere of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was obsessed and could find refuge on the oil fence.
He said, “It was not possible for her to go out again, so we have been helped.”
The water was healthy and in good condition until it was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to start business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to collect business representatives and to identify what changes the United Kingdom's welfare and job makers want to see in relation to the EU.
To that end, we have commissioned the largest and largest survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on Britain, the business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, who represented a wide range of businesses in Britain, sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will seem hopeless to many.
We have found that the growing majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities across Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are in the process.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than the long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster from anti-dumping regulations.
There was a general lack of satisfaction on the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of the Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of the entry into the European trade zone, even 40 per cent of the major enterprises, which are traditionally the most European-led companies in all.
Finally, our review of business leaders revealed that the majority of the UK wants to make a course to change the treaty and to EU relations based on trade rather than politics.
This result, observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business continues to be a “significant change” that will return power to Britain.
The high rates — the achievement of changes to the treaty and the more favourable conditions for Great Britain — will ensure a 16 per cent increase in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt that this study shows that British business supports his plan to review the conditions of the UK EU membership.
It also shows that business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and become increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters into a more tighter economic and financial union.
The priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Great Britain, and, as the results of our review show, this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's normative activities.
The U.S. officials are listening to a personal phone call from the Pope of Rome
The activities of the Vatican are under the strict control of the American Specialists.
The new documents from the Eduard Snouden collection show that the United States survey has heard all the talks of the former Pope of Benedict, and is now fully informed by Pope France.
His phone began to listen to him before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of selecting a new pope was observed.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The service is connected to hundreds of catholic telephones gathered in Rome to elect a genuine Pope.
The telephones of the residents were also heard where the conclavians lived.
The American spies listened to all the main petitioners on the papal throne to prevent the appearance of the Vashington figure.
The Panoram newspaper says that the “great silence of the United States” continued to reopen the talks of the talks until the end of the 12th March.
It is claimed that the Argentine archipelago of Bergolio has been designated as the future Pope of Rome in the United States since 2005.
The U.S. survey also included negotiations on the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that in the Roma mission the United States continues to operate a secret group of CRU and ARB operators providing information on policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican announced kindly that he was not interested in the American "response" even if it did.
From the U.S. leadership to the Holy Fathers, there is no secret.
Snoubordist specially photographed for Olympic Cups
In the middle of Russia's bank issued a memorial note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will already be held.
The name of the cup is 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already actively ironic about the memory bank.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they pointed out that the picture of the bank bank with the banknotes could be found in the bank.
In particular, in the free storage room, StockExchange, where this photo was dated in 2005.
The same picture is used in the photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, she has already been used in the RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic Bank is executed in a sine-long humme.
On the one hand, there's a snowboarder flying over the Sochi, a type of Olympic stadium and a bird.
The author of the bank design is Paul Bushev, who won a competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Art, named Repin.
The presentation noted that a number of types of sports were considered to be irrigated, frescoy and trampling, but as a result, snowboard was chosen because it was relative to the young type of sport.
According to the source of the "Knowledge" near the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the public's view of the wide spread of the image of the neo-Bandist from the Olympic Bank and is now investigating the situation.
In Goznak there is not too much concern about the huge area of the Olympic Bank.
The head of the Press Service, Mr. Natalya Nikiforova, said that all the discussions on the beach were ridiculous.
The bank's snowboarder will come right back, on pictures on the left, Nikifrova explained.
The man at the photosession to create a dot was taken from different points, then a final picture was chosen, which was a character behind a snowflake.
She also noted that copyright laws were not distributed on the Olympic Bank, as the artist had received wages for work.
Experts believe that the discussion around the picture on the Olympic Cup was positive.
The identity of the image on the cube - plus for its movement - is considered by the Executive Director of the NP "RussBrend" Alexei Popovicev.
Evidence of the percentage of imagery on the screen and on the photobanks is difficult enough, so requests for intellectual property dispute on the picture are not made.
The first Olympics were held in China to the Olympic Games in Beijing on June 10, 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legal prohibitions prevented Russians from drinking less beer
The Russian beer has a bad mood.
According to their claims, the consumption of beer in the country in the future year remains at an early level, and this is best done.
Although businessmen were greatly counted on growth.
The current year has failed: sales fell by 7 per cent.
All of this led the head of one of the country's largest beer companies, the President of the Russian Federation, Isaac Sheps, at the IIIrd Annual Conference of the Institute of Adam Smith, "The Tower of Daily Demand in Russia", which was only completed in Moscow.
It was discussed by the State governing the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already decreased by 18 per cent, since in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and processing of beer - alcohol with low alcohol content - Sheps told listeners.
In no country in the world, there is such a severe restriction on the beer market, an unprecedented introduction of all new and new illegal restrictions, which are justified in the fight against alcohol abuse.
Pivovar noted that many of the laws aimed at reducing the level of alcohol abuse do not have a special impact, but all new initiatives are constantly under way.
More than all of the beer producers have been affected by the ban on selling spirit drinks since that year.
"We lost 35,000 users soon," said Isaac Scheps.
In the future year, there are two forecasts.
Optimisticly, the one that Sheps said is that the sale of pen drinks remains on the previous level.
Pessimistics are still 2-3 per cent.
In order to keep their income, businessmen have to leave the classes calculated on a mass user, in the "primium" class: beer will be less, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, the radical effects of the decline in sales with a small amount of spirit have not yet been seen.
"In my observation, the level of alcoholism's disease remains about the same level, according to Dr. Alexe Sotnik's doctor.
It is true that it has increased the proportion of the sick, consumed by solid drinks, as well as those who have been “subsidized” to the anti-smokers of the Yaguara kind, while ten years ago, it has been dominated by the so - called drinking alcohol.
In September, 600 people were fired from Ford's motorbike in the universe.
According to the trade unions, all released were compensated.
However, the question of reducing production in the region is more serious than the problems of workers.
At the meeting, Mr. Zaxa Aleksey Etmanov said that about 600 people had been reduced to Ford's company in the universe.
In his statement, this was still in September: then, according to the voluntary release programme, which had been developed together with the Organization's trade union, some 600 people had left the profession.
Workers who decided to leave on their own were offered a number of loans for "golden parachutes".
As a result, the majority of them left their jobs on their own.
According to Etmanov, however, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to be the case.
However, in the next two years, the authorities have not planned to adopt any programme of support for hard-to-state enterprises,” he explained, adding that the Government does not take into account the pace of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
The Forum does not review or confirm this information.
We are waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as it appears, we are obliged to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of Forda's workforce in the universe have been coming up for a long time.
Yes, for example, the company's plans to kill 600 people became known in September.
Formerly, the plant had announced that it would stop the production of cars.
For reasons of occupation, the demand for Ford vehicles in Russia was called.
According to Petrostat, the industrial production in Lenoblast was reduced by 5.4 per cent over nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile phones will be used during flight and landing
The new rules on the safe use of mobile devices during flight and landing are approved in the United States, reports BBC.
It is expected that U.S. airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and plans throughout the journey, and new rules will begin to operate by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connection for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights of less than 3 kilometres.
As a result of the danger of inter-shipment of aircraft, a hundred votes remain under ban.
Travellers will thus be allowed to read e-books, play games on maps and other gajets, and watch video on domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines have to convince the U.S. Civil Aviation Federal Authority that they are likely to be affected by aircraft mobile and aircraft management.
According to the source, for example, the United States of America may also review existing rules for the use of electronic devices in flights.
A new name for the Russian Mafia was finally established in the United States.
This week a black list of Russian Mafia has been filled with new names and four companies.
The US Ministry of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and Israelis into the "Brade Round."
One of the Russians was a famous singer Grigory Leps, who was suspected of being carrying money to members of the group.
In all, 22 persons in the black list of United States dollars participating in the "Brothers' round" and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt the existence of such an organization.
“The call for the Brethren circle is more likely to try to combine various criminal groups”, previously stated an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the Brethren circle reflects the popular view of the Russian Mafia.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization,” Mr. Galeotti of the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galletty agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelley, University.
“If they and the media are active, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” says the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of the last year, Mark Galehoti suggested that the "British Circle" would be combined to the most close Russian enemies in the law of Aslan Usojan, known as Dad Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Yes, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zahariya Kalaukov, who completed the 2012 list, were closely linked to Ded Hasan, and another participant, Themuri Mirzoev, came to Dedu Hasan to be a member of the family.
However, Mr. Galehoti notes that some individuals have no relationship with Usojan.
In his view, all of them were better combined with general financial and criminal interests, such as drug delivery from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "British Circle" of Gregory Lepsa - a beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of Kremlin.
Of course, we believe that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners about why such a decision was made, said the Secretary-General of the State of Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of RF.
As with the interests of all citizens of the RFI, its interests will be protected.
Head of the Gasproma Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is a new gas gas station.
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the major energy projects in Europe, said the Head of Gasproma.
“Today there has been a marked event: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream gas station, the largest and important project in Europe, has begun,” said President Alexei Miller in his fourth statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The conclusion of the agreement between Gazapromo and its partners in Ukraine, in which most of the gas for Russia is intended for Europe, increases the level of risk for ordinary routes.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were permanently removed.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at reduced prices, as soon as the whole project is started in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should start in other countries, which are further on the gas pipeline, by the end of the year.
The annual projectal flow capacity of the pipeline consists of 2.2 trillion cubic centimetres of natural gas.

Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathana Lorda, as reported by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children before the 2011 complaint against a childcare agency in Karingbahe Jonathana Lorda reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission ' s opening statement stated that it “had never dealt with sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director of Philip Haira asked about one case when an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography and the other when an instructor was charged with sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Heir said that Gail Fernes, a lawyer who was helping the Commission, knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in its opening address to the Commission, also allowed a lack of accuracy, stating that “was the external verification of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA was the first line to ensure the safety of children”.
The witness commissions report that YMCA had been notified that it had received a second of the four possible quality audits carried out by the Department of Education and the community in August this year.
Mr. Heir, who entered the YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and the following leadership had been mistaken, led by Lord Lord, and was unable to provide a clear understanding of his obligations relating to children ' s security policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years of work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr. Heir rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA had prevented staff members from reporting violations of Lord's child security.
The staff showed that they had observed violations, including that Lord was with the children, that he was personally chasing them, that he would put them on his knees, that he loved one of them, and that he would let them play his cell phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of Lord, and asked for her child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnet, a child care manager at the YMCA office in Karingbahe, which was the leader of Lorda, “a scary and often difficult one”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept any explanation from the staff that they had been unable to report the situation to his superior leaders.
He said that their friendship with Lord had soon led them to think about the need to tell about him.
Mr. Heir said that he had submitted his opinion to the New South Wales YMCA Council that the training for the organization of the "Jontan Lord's trial" was not "required to provide information" by the staff, and agreed with it.
Mr. Heir said that the decision to force staff to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegations had been made was adopted by the Director-General of YMCA on the care of children by Liam Witley.
He said that this was called for to prevent a number of evidence, but in this case, they “were patient” and that decision was bad.
YMCA, New South Wales, was not safe for the children of the organization during its work in the period 2009-2011, reported to the Committee of Experts on Children's Growth, Professor Steven Smolboon of the University of Griffit.
He said that there were “some serious problems” in the collection, selection, instruction, training and control of staff.
The hearings are suspended until 20 December.
Week of fashion in San Paulo.
They think it's not just a manoeuvre, but this star.
Despite the fact that Jigel Bundschen had temporarily left his job, she had been working on maternity leave these days and this week's disability.
The absence of many months did not prevent her from keeping her place on the floor and on the fifteenth floor.
Visil remains the most highly paid supermodel of the world.
This time she was involved in Kolči's defilament.
The end of the week of fashion is usually the most interesting evidence.
That's what the stylist Lino Willaventura organized.
Mark is more than 30 years old, parallel to the production of pre-a-ports of the luxury class, the model works actively in theatre and cinematographs, fashioning mirrors and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 companies and companies were involved in textile industry and the peace of fashion in San Paulo during the weekend.
This is one of the most dynamicly developing areas of production involving more than 2 million Brazilians, with an annual turnover of up to $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he used the chance to return as Prime Minister of Great Britain, but admitted that the return was minor.
In an interview on the fifth year of care from his post, 59-year-old policies expressed their views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his retirement in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has largely avoided discussion of the British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to the 4th Middle East peacekeepers.
In response to the question whether he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, on the report of London's Evening Standard, he said: "Yes, of course, but if that ever happens, so..."
The head coach Milano Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the failure of the 10th anniversary of the Italian champion with Lacio.
The expert also noted that the failures of the old are due to the series of losses of leading players.
I'm so sorry we couldn't win, that's what allegory said.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
At first we didn't allow Lacio.
In the second place, they bought it, but I can't say in general that we lost the concentration.
We had to win.
In the past season, we have met the target of a fall in the League of Champions.
We're leaving the schedule now, but this is due to a series of key football players' injuries.
Ramy and Honda?
It's a very good game, of course.
But our composition is good now.
Look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Transport experts working at Cardiff to fight for the Lussad season knew that competition would be very high.
But nobody was ready to show up for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Even more than a schoolboy, just a few months before his first step, this little girl, with her six-year-old daughters-in-law, Toffi, had gone through three rounds to make it easy to take the lead, leaving 30 adults behind.
This unique pair — the same growth — received high external assessments, behavior and style at the annual competition, held at the Sannibeck horse sports center in Radri near Cardifa.
In a universal view of the background of men and women in high-fashioned shoes, he slammed his hat and proudly walked around the two-year-old Toffi.
The judges commended Fentona for not all of its years of experience in dealing with the ills.
Toffi received a higher assessment of the external nature and nature.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third day of birth in March last year, and since then he has been working with the Shetland understand every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffi are a beautiful dot."
They had a lot of opponents, but these two went with a golden cube and a light.
It was his second statement with Toffi, and we were all in the race when he won.
It was thought to be so phenomenal that the unknowns in the arena wanted to photograph it.
This boy from the village of Nantanglo, who is shortly away from Ebwell in South Wales, is on his way to his aunt Sharon Hawkes, who has been exposed to evils for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “All the audience was upset, and all of them cried out for approval and applause.”
He ran after a dog all along the arena and, although he seemed so short, did his job well.
Fenton without any idea of animals — he likes bad people, tractors, and plants, and he has two bicycles that he cares about.
The judge, as he began, will soon take part in the Year of the Year, and I am sure he will speak well.
The representative of this annual horse show said: “Fenton has only three years, but he knows how to deal with his mind.”
Together they're a great team.
The judges noted Fentona and Toffi for their outward appearance and for how they presented themselves on the show.
They appreciate the harmony of the speech of the poet and the poet, Fenton and Toffi, who were the best at the race.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive band, and he really looked very good at his role.
Public call by the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization belongs”
The Chinese newspaper, published in the first half of the appeal to release the accused in the record, must be reorganised, reports the press regulator.
The New Express, published in Guançao, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yunção.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken over his written statements about a company with a public share of property.
The New Express should now proceed “the process of full correction of errors”, as reported by the regulator.
The “correction of errors” was issued by the Government of Guangdong in the field of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several false reports on the company's bears registered in Zoomlion for the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The New Express Edition Guide has been deoriented,” said the regulator.
He reported that the decision had been taken “to impose an administrative appeal on Chen Yunzhou in the form of a call for his reporting licence”.
He also advised Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the responsible journalists and immediately amend the New Express Guide.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he stated financial violations in the construction equipment of the company called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the first half, stating that he supported his journalistic activities.
However, Mr. Chen then appeared on public television acknowledging that he had published false articles about money.
“In this case, I damage Zoomlion’s company, as well as the entire media industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he told the public news company CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my fault.
Following Mr. Chenya ' s recognition of the New Express, he made an apology on the first floor, stating that the newspaper could not properly verify his report.
A few of the suspects recently recognized television.
Experts say that the practice of obtaining recognition in China has continued to be widely distributed despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from causing anyone to negotiate.
U.S. tunnel discovered — Mexico for the transfer of drugs by its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels has been found for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, provided by its own lighting, ventilation and electric power supply systems.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel as one of the most difficult secrets ever discovered.
This tunnel, consisting of nearly six football fields, connects the slopes of the town of Tihuan (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with undetectable stocks that facilitates the spread of drugs in the cargo.
Tunnel was closed before any drug was transmitted, as the authorities have said.
According to judicial documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine during the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of their imprisonment, they are threatened with imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, opposers use extensive underground mining channels.
Tunnel is the eighth major event in San Diego since 2006.
A number of major tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the harvest of rice marijuana in October, which placed before drug cartels a difficult task for the fast delivery of their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a long passage of some 700 yards, supplied by the railways, which flowed from the kitchen of one of the houses in Taiwan to two warehouses in San Diego.

The British police are sending Assanzu a notice of extradition
The British police have today issued a notice on the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanža, who was hiding in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and requested asylum.
In Scotland, it was stated that they had issued an Australian 40-year-old “official requirement to deliver” with a request to appear in the police station, adding that if he did not comply with this requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanzu is threatening extradition in Sweden for sexual offences after he has exhausted his capacity under British law when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June he joined Ecuador's Embassy in London, requesting political asylum in this South American country.
Scotland Yard “has given a 40-year-old man an official requirement to get him to the police station on the day and time after our election”, the Secretary-General reported.
It continues to undermine the conditions of freedom under the law.
The mission refused to comment on the police notification.
Assassin is afraid that he will be expelled from Sweden to the United States in order to file his possible accusations in Spain after the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic expenditures against the WikiLeaks website.
A driver running at a speed of 130 miles in an hour with a hot drink between his leg, excavated at £1,000
The vehicle was fired at £1,000 for speeding up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot pressure held between the leg.
35-year-old Andrew Houi of Tiptrey, Essex, was noted for his role as Mercedes Benz at the A120 pass in Breintri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a request to bring him in between his feet.
In the case of Colchester Houi, the World Court recognized the charge of leadership without due consideration and attention.
The addition to his driver's approval of seven fines resulted in a six-month ban on their leadership.
Houi also had to pay costs of £90 and additional collection to help victims of crime at £100.
Tax for foreign estate owners will result in London's booming
The target was a preliminary assessment of capital growth tax measures, but expected a final decision by Mr. Osborn, who, in the 2012 budget, introduced the rate of government revenue of 7 per cent for households worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own households instead of natural persons.
At this point, the housing unit in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, representing 708 million pounds in 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-west, Northern West, Yorkshire and Hamburg together.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in the housing and the introduction of this anti-refoulement legislation, it was very difficult to establish that the tax on the debt of property was reduced regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system”.
“But this could lead to the fact that some foreign investors would be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners would not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class mobility, above 5-10 % of the price-based housing market, in the rich south-west London, which extends from Fulham to Wimboldon, has increased to 11.8 % over the last year.
According to Savills, prices in the centre of London continued to show sustained growth of 5.6 per cent per annum, but ended up actively developing a “relevant market” with high prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4 per cent) and in the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how hair movements are related to its shape.
Early studies have shown that sufficient dogs fly on the right side (on the left side of the dog), while raised dogs are on the left hand.
But now scientists say that other dog family representatives can detect and react to these dark differences in the wild.
Professor George Vallortgara, neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in the formation of building blocks that are positive or negative.”
Here we tried to look at it in other ways.
He added that, like humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and the opposite side, and two half plays a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the diverse impact of other dogs, researchers observed animals watching other dogs.
They measured the rate of heart failure of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes sent to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortgara said: “We have shown dogs video with dogs, naturalist versions, or silhouette to escape from any other underlying factors, and we have been able to manipulate the movement of the horse and make the horse more to the left or right. ”
When animals saw that in the rest of the non-expressive dog the horse was moving right (from the point of view of the flying horse), they were completely weakened.
But when they noticed that the horse was moving too far on the left (again from the point of view of the flying dog), their heart was touched and they looked confused.
Professor Vallortger said he didn't think dogs were deliberately interfering with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what moves they should worry about and what they should not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their weight loss is related to more friendly behavior, and the right of the party is less friendly, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and printers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal.
The expert on dog behavior, John Bradshaw, invited by a scientific officer at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to check whether dogs were important to the left and right of the party.
Last year a team of scholars from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog and actually look at a sufficient dog.
In another science work at Victoria University, Canada, he reported: “Because of the fact that it was often a job, when the disease was directed to the left rather than to the right rather than to the right to become enthralled, the opposite attitude towards the Italian study. ”
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in different studies did not fully capture animals in movies or robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs respond to these dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence to show that two-fold brains are used for different purposes, many details are still to be explained, and dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be registered, it is likely that we will soon understand why their muscles are sometimes sent to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys perform a concert in Glazgo because of Alexa Turner's illness
The Rock-Group Arctic Monkeys held a concert in Glazgo after her obscenary was diagnosed with a laryngitis.
The main group should have been on the city concert hall of Hydro on Friday.
However, the patient, Alex Turner, stopped taking them to the show.
The Panel ' s statement was made after it had been forced to leave the LG Arena concert in Birmingham on Thursday.
A statement on its official Arctic Monkeys website stated: “After the decision to transfer the show to the Burmingham LG Arena tonight and after medical assistance to Arctic Monkeys, the show must also be suspended on the Hydro Square in Glazgo on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alexo Turner has been diagnosed with "laringitis", and unfortunately he is not able to speak.”
The LG Arena show in Birmingham will now be held on 20 November and the show in Glazgo will be held on 21 November.
All the tickets on this show are still valid.

Pope Francis calling the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will lead the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time during his term of service on 22 February, as declared in the fourth Vatican.
Cardinals are the highest spirits in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
After reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, however, he could no longer participate in the pope's elections, which is a prelude to the 120 "cardinal electoral group".
In proclaiming this news, the Vatican Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a collection of all present cardinals, known as the constable, would be held before the funeral ceremony.
“The Pope of France decided to report earlier on his decision to organize a concert in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic vote said that by February, the number of candidates for election was likely to decrease.
He said that the pope usually refers to as many cardinals as it is necessary to bring the number of candidates up to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age, as much as he wishes.
Consistency will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since the French elections in March of that year, as Valero said.
At this point, there is a kind of preoccupation for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It would be interesting to see if a new cardinal pope from other regions of the world would be appointed to restore the balance,” he noted.
In South America, there are 40 per cent of Catholics, but they are represented by a low number of cardinals.
It will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to seek ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope made a decision on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that "as far as possible", that Francisk would be called to the diasporas after the Council.
But we were not in that situation before — it was all for us first.
Valero said that the popes were usually sent to the cardinal of the bishops from large incomes, but French was “a full of surprises, so we don’t know who it is. ”
GM calls for a number of new pickups in the United States to repair the seat stop.
General Motors Co calls for almost 19 thousand new peaks of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra in 2014 to address the problems with the manual control of the seat belt, as reported on Friday by the United States authorities in the field of road safety.
Some of the pre-seats may have a defect in the spinal cord mechanism.
As a result, the seating block does not comply with the federal security standards of car transport by the headmasters.
“The driver and passengers may not properly protect the driver or passenger when the vehicle is hit, by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
The models referred to were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of the GM pickup began in June and represents the most important start of the car in the major production for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the failure in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was unable to review the notification to the owners regarding the 16-day termination of the Government ' s work, which reduced the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of peaks of Silverado and Sierra, which were modernized for the 2014 model line, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, as reported by the GM company on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pixels of Silverado and 16,503 pixels of Sierra.
The GM shares at the New York Foundation branch increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday to $37,47.
Cricket waiting for Obama's electoral
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the restructuring of the Republicans to bring praise to the net.
Designism cannot serve to justify the problems with the web site reformed the Ombudsperson Health System
The 2008 Obama campaign was a memorable reminder of what might be possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the second class of Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible print book these days.
I thought this book would comfort me during my second high school graduation and give me a feeling of hope.
It is called the “Victory for Victory”, and it is a reminder of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barak Obama.
When I end up writing reports about my patients at night and lying in bed, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and expressions could capture the spirit.
The election victory was overwhelming, and the leading news programmes took a break for this historic moment.
My classmates cried out with joy, and my parents took all the magazines they could find.
The young strategy team had to come to the White House, and the people were ready to change.
At the time of Obama's entry into office in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I'm closing the book.
The return here is a terrible awakening, such as eviction from the dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they are spoken of as a distant reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I left my first election ticket, the changes have really taken place.
That's what I couldn't even imagine.
I give Obama due respect for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the Act on Access to Medical Assistance to the Exploitation of Our Soldiers from Iraq, to the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, do not speak”, the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party designism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the base in Guantánamo among others.
But after an unlimited number of times, when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and witnesses, I ended up explaining what I could provide.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
The restructuring of the Republicans cannot justify the hearing of foreign leaders or the imposition of attacks on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on American private life by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of plaintiffs who reveal wrong acts of the Government.
It cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anvar Al-Awy without a court and the consequences or failure to comply with the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to shut down the media are “self-aggressive... from the time of the administration of Nixon”.
In recent times, it cannot justify the lack of a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Access to Medical Assistance Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I be 18 years old to understand that leadership may be opposed to the political campaigns that are ahead of it?
Obviously, election is not a programme of action, as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and events such as the disaster in Newton.
Nevertheless, above all the examples I have listed above, it is evident that they have been a significant choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted again in favour of Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidate.
Mitt Romni was a bold and bold alternative, saying that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that, in my second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, justified the hope we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, it was much harder to return in 2008.
This makes me feel ashamed of the many promises I've made.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton made Obama's first election in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting on the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they had to return to normal and remain faithful to their purpose.
"I want us to return our attractiveness," he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I agree with you perfectly.
The comments in this commentary are exclusively of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave.
Member of the billionaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbot had a conflict of interest in childcare, as his daughters could be arrested and taken away from this benefit.
It was a top-ranking industry that had an unregulated dispute on the taxation of carbon emissions in the amount of $6 million, which made this statement when he tried to avoid the question of whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Party of Palmer may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be of decisive importance in the decision to withdraw taxes on carbon emissions and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbot's daughters would be more self-responsible than political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interests when it comes to childcare allowance, because if any of these girls are taken away, he will be directly interested in whether or not they will be released,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially announced to Mr. Palmer the victory in the battle against the Sanchain-Kost electoral district, with a transfer of 53 votes after the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the voting procedure to speed up the process.
Daughters Tony Abbot Francis and Brigitte.
Should the decision on this election be taken two months after we voted?
“They need a more complete system,” he said.
Why should we not have such a system so that we can come in, put our data on the computer, vote quickly and get results at 18:30 that very evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of a licensee for labeling in the bulletins.
That's because they can keep the results out if he doesn't like anyone?
The use of kandash in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is considering the possibility of an electronic vote and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain-Kost and he would be “very serious” with regard to his new work.
The State office assumes the service of the community.
“We do not receive any reward except through history, because at critical times we can serve this area”, he said.
RBS removes two currency trends
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily withdrew from the work of two trade unions in its currency operations unit, according to the information provided by two persons who were aware of the situation, which is another evidence that the global verification of regulated currency manipulations on the market takes place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including U.S., Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with regulators in the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 million.
These two triads will be the first RBS staff removed during the development investigation, which will be interrupted by a scandal related to the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
By refusing to comment on the derogation, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation on this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators”, reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, reported that RBS transmitted e-mails and e-mails that received and sent it to the former Brittany Authority, the Office for Financial Control (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, was granted permission to his current position as head of European trade unions in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchanani, the leader of European trade unions in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardener, the former monetary leader in Barclays and U.S., was removed from the work of the Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of them were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The Bank reported on this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating the alleged money market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six governing bodies in the world — the European Commission, Finland, Switzerland Weko, the FCA, the United States Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Administration — consider claims that banks entered into a contract for monetary market effects.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also begun internal checks or requests for information from regulatory authorities, who said that they were aware of the person ' s situation.
Banks are looking for mixed communications and e-mails for several years in search of offences.
News of audits has been fragmented in the field of activities, which has been one of the major sources of income of the investment banking units in recent years, which this year has faced difficulties because low-voltility has reduced the opportunities for buyers.
Some banks have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and high-fashioned currency market is virtually unmanipulating, but adults say that it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the vast amount of daily trade on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of banks by their internal platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came on the same day when the Bank of Credit Suisse declared that one of its trade unions had been killed this week after it lost almost $6 million at the end of the last year.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the Triader has acted alone and that this issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama Health Act
The Supreme Court of the United States has today decided that the Barack Obama Health Act is constitutional, which is the great victory of Obama's administration.
By voting against 5 against 4, the judges decided that certain provisions under the Law on the Protection of Patients and Access to Health requiring citizens to obtain or pay taxes by 2014 were constitutional in accordance with the Government's tax powers.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, arrested four more liberal members of the court, while judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also left the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further decided that the requirement of the Health Act to improve the compliance of the State with the Medicaid programme, or that they would lose all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not institutionally mandatory.
The bill was sought to block 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The Act was strongly opposed to each of the main Republican candidates in presidential elections during the 2012 initial election season, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romny.
Football — Why So Different?
In the Lord's eyes, policy and experts in the Open Tribunal have been talking about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: prohibiting football in the North Caucasus because of this game is one of the scandals and differences.
Spiker Sergei Naruchkin recalled recent events in Birulewa and said that in order to reduce the "pressure rate in society" policy and media should be corrected in statements.
He probably had a recent scandal with Vladimir Jirinowski, who in one of the telemedicines threatened to surround Cavca with a colloquium if they didn't want to limit birth control...
All speakers were also talking about measures to regulate migration from the SNG countries, and on measures to harmonise relations between the peoples of Russia, which contributed to the debate on cohesion.
Maxim Grigorev said that the events in Birulewa were "a model conflict that could have been advanced", but "we have too many people and institutions" and seven children without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long been in practice with migrants in Europe, in the public's view, has gone astray and must seek its way.
The historian Yury Peters put great hope in a new one - story teacher.
"The history of the peoples of the country still needs to help them to know that the schools in Tatarstan are living in Dagestan, and on the contrary," he said.
Gennadi Zuganov proposed to impose criminal responsibility on "the call for Russia": "If the United States says on radio that Alaska should give Russia, you will be arrested and spent 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Jirinovian tried very hard not to make it.
As usual, he accused journalists who had serious and serious national problems of public discussion: “In the dust of Poland, there is little to be said!”
The leader of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Vasilev, advised journalists to conclude a "charity" and to agree on the subject in a timely manner, and then the same commitments could be made to themselves and to politics.
We have adopted about 30 laws governing migration, and the order is generally established, said Mr. Vasilev.
As an example, he introduced a law requiring regional and municipal authorities to take responsibility for the international peace in their territory.
But there was no division of the law by the East Ludmila Andrčenko: it had no " written submissions about the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and boundaries.
Thus, the sub-items will deal with different levels of authority.
At the same time, municipalities have no personnel needed to deal with such complex issues, no means, and no methodological recommendations that they could use do not give them...
The head of the Committee on National Affairs, Gajmit Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special office called the Ministry of National Security, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerius Tishkov, who led a similar agency, later released in the 1990s, spoke against it.
It's enough to have at the federal level a special man, "Minister without a portfolio", who could be called if it were.
"We are on the ground, facing a number of challenges, and it is very important for representatives of different ethnic and religious groups to speak against persecution, and this work must be given valuable information support," said the representative of the CRC on relations with the society of the Universal Chaplin.
There is no neutrality of the State with regard to dangerous ideology, including, in his view, should not be.
There, Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected Russian: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan are still looking for it, but they don't interpret them that way, not that way," he said.
"Not that way" is the development of football: "The football player beats the whole crowd, the flags are yellow, the partners forget each other's stones...
Maybe we don't need that football?
There's another kind of sport - the rules are called...
They said, "There will be no sport in the world for their people."
There will be no one to play in Kavca's row, Mr. Jirinowski has joined.
You're still driving them!
You need to know the national features, that's all the same thing as the "Protection" thing to offer...
In Yaroslava, the representatives of the Moscow Club were distinguished by good conduct on the tribunals during the local club.
The football has to be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFS Committee, Arthur Grigorianc, reported that Cuba has been cleared of 500 thousand rubles, and has been transferred from the House of Football by Philippe PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the beauty club are applied to support the Dagestana flag by patients on trial during the 14th anniversary of the 14th anniversary of Anji.
At the meeting, representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL, were present.
We've studied all available materials.
The unrighteous behavior of Cuban viewers is estimated at 500 thousand rubles.
against Google, Samsung, Huawei patent claims
A group of thousands of former Nortel patents placed a full series of patent claims against mobile telephone producers, including Google, at the price that it passed on to Nortel's bank auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, who purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel's patent, filed claims for violations of patent rights in the United States District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents include technologies that help compare the Internet search keywords with their respective advertising, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are providing mobile phones working on the Google Android operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel's patents the original price of $900 million.
Google has several times increased the proposed price, finally offering a total of $4.4 billion.
In the case of the patents of the Nortel Consortium Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly the library of the patents of the Motorola company.
“Despite the failed attempt to acquire patents that are the subject of demand, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” said the court.
Rockstar requires a higher compensation for Google's losses, as it claims that the violation of patent rights by Google is deliberate, as required.
The first freely elected President takes the oath in Egypt
Muhammad Mursey has made an oath, but the day of his exile will hardly mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursey promised "a new Egypt" when he made an oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replaced by Hosni Mubarak, who was imprisoned 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab Peace and the fifth head of the State in Egypt some 60 years after the monarchy took place.
He made a sworn oath before 18 judges in black houses in a court building on the bank of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursey said during a memorable ceremony that was shown on public television.
“Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursey, 60-year-old engineer with American education from the "Bretev-Musulman", a fundamentalist group, most of which had been banned from its 84-year existence by an organization serving as a mission for the cruel acts of other Governments.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police when Mursey arrived with a small court shortly after 11 a.m. on local time.
Only a few hundred of the parties gathered in court to welcome the new President, and, unlike the President's time bomb in Mubarak, the movement was only delayed for a short time to miss his autocolonate on a usually alive road, which is connected to the city centre with the southern rewards.
Although Mursey was a disparaging “safety college” of Bratev, his personal prestige had grown dramatically since his victory and his fifth speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only to Muslims but also to all those who wanted to bring to the end of the 2011 resurrection against the authorious Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursey, who was in the blue business suit with a beautiful glove, to the judges in the general forest panels, where he had taken his oath.
Later, Mursey went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to do his insurgent thing.
He was granted official approval by the army orchestra, which performed the public game during which he stood at the “silent” stop.
A military officer was present at the Feldmarshal Hussein Tantavi.
His visit was attended by the sound of “Armiya and the People — One Hand, ” which had been scanted by hundreds of people gathered in the principal lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a global educational platform, the Cairo University in 1970 became a platform for Islamic student groups.
Mursey took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the rebellion ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and promised to return to the authority of the president whose office was left by the military council, who had taken the case from the accused leader.
However, by agreeing to take an official oath before the court rather than before the Parliament as adopted, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
The word Mursey on Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist passions.
A regular meeting of the Association of Tuman Engineers was held on the basis of the Yalutor's car race.
As part of the event, a new line was presented on the production of electromagnetic tubes from the table.
As the business director of Dennis Gribanov said, a marketing study was conducted in 2011 with a new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes over 50,000 tons of electricity per month.
Thereafter, a decision was taken to change the profile of the profession and to set up equipment for their production.
Over 7,000 tons of manufactured products have already been downloaded this year.
The investment in the plant consisted of more than 120 million rub-lei, and Dennis Gribanov said.
A new state was launched in October, allowing for an increase in assortment.
It is used as a small tube profile, which is used for foot-and-mouth, small forms of construction and for furniture, as well as for the construction industry.
We plan to increase the production level of 50,000 tons of products per year, which is about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tuman region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of business staff has not decreased - it now accounts for 157 people, with an increase of over 50 staff in the purchase of new equipment.
The company is in the process of retraining, and the necessary specialists are being gathered from the available.
In the coming year, a new food chain is planned to be a total of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another state, at the speed of production of the tube up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company was about to recover the emissions of noise used in the housing-community industry.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumenian demand for this product.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, urged the managers of the production, to give more attention to modernization of machinery.
To this end, the forms and forms of public support of the industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates for the purchase of new equipment and its cost.
In the current year, 150 million rubles are intended to be allocated, two thirds of which have already been lost.
The latter commission, which will consider subsidization treaties, shall adopt documents from business until 15 November.
In addition, the budget is reimbursed for the participation of local producers in international brands.
The budget is budgeted for the next year by 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for Lising Payments and Credits for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the Marks, 3 million will be allocated to the energy-saving programme.
Up to 72 million rubles are reduced to the reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment that is produced in the south of the Tuman region for the oil complex.
According to Leonida Ostroumov, this form of support is expected to cease, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation for the benefit of the oil companies paid in the area budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become a direct cost obligation in the region.
In view of this, the Government considers direct support for industrial enterprises rather than financing the oil sector through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation in the oil sector.
The acquisition of their equipment is a competitive advantage of the southern Tuman industry, and it will be difficult to compare it with the average Russian land, where there is more labour force.
In addition, there is an unclear question about the mobility of the new owner of the TNC-WR, Rosneft, who has not yet placed its orders on the Tuman enterprises.
The Uvat Project Implementation Agreement expires in 2013, and its application for extension has not been made.
At present, South-South enterprises that specialize in equipment for the oil sector cannot produce a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
It remains open to the question whether the amounts obtained from the oil in the Uvat region will be received in the region's budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the premises.
Tomic plays 240 hours for extremist role in concentration.
The Lenin Regional Court of Tomska condemned the city ' s compulsory work of 240 hours, which was distributed on the social network of extremist extremism, and reported to the RIA News on Friday by the press representative of the District Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was added to the federal list of extremist materials.
In this regard, a criminal case was brought to light under the article of the CFF “Acts aimed at incitement of hatred and hatred, as well as undermining the dignity of the human being publicly committed”.
“The Lenin District Court considered the case in particular and recognized a man guilty of the above-mentioned offence by imposing a sentence of 240 hours of compulsory work”, said the agency’s associate.
She added that the man fully acknowledged his guilt.
Azarov promised the buyers the price of goods after the signing of an association with the Euro-Union
Ukraine's Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is confident that prices in the country will be significantly reduced after the country has signed an agreement on association with the European Union.
He said this during a discussion with his readers on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the Agreement and the entry into force of the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU is significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should also be reduced.
"It's about goods coming from EU countries," he wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be so direct, it will be focused.
However, there should also be no price increases.
That is why the communication on the billboards that have recently appeared in our country quite a lot, that the association with the EU is a growing price, it is not quite so, or if it is more accurate to say, it is not."
Follow-up checks on child abuse in Bisque
On 29 October, the media reported that one of the children ' s hospitals in the city of Biisca had shut the child down in the basement.
The investigators are currently explaining all the circumstances, as well as the legal assessment of the actions of children's garden staff.
After the accusation in the foolish case, Evgenia Vasileva spoke
Vasilieva, a person with almost a year's interest in the media, has not yet commented on many publications in the press, both in Minboron, and on her personal relations with the Prime Minister of Defence, Anatolia Heartuk, her predecessors, and her valuables.
However, on November 1st, a figure in the Obonon Service case violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasilieva, she said: "Of course, the task was one: to remove any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence."
It was a shame that I had to give evidence, otherwise I would be thrown into prison.
Today, these threats have stopped.
As long as we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We're 100 percent confident in victory.
However, it can be concluded from the interview that, please, most of Vasiliev's comments were made on the fact that she had nothing to eat.
It is likely that a statement by the official representative of the SC RF Vladima Markina was made that a deal was found in the collection of a picture that was collected by the author of the Oboronservice case.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the farmer, confident in his profound knowledge of the art, acquired as the masterpieces of the world record.
However, an art expert appointed by investigators after the arrest of these images found that they had no divine value and, in other words, were real deals," Markin noted early in October.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they all admitted that they were not stolen from Minboron, and they said I had a taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal moments?
I mean, it's just a misunderstanding," says Vasileva.
In this regard, whether she recognized her guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes that she had replaced, Vasilieva said: "Of course not.
Just admit something.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They just lead the people into error, here and there.
In addition, in response to today's CCF statement that Vasilieva was removed from the study of criminal matters, the lawyer stated that he and his client had “not been identified with the materials of the case”.
What led to the discovery of Vasili's house arrest, so far not being shared with the press?
How could a woman not respond to a charge in a bad taste?
Or did the rights of the Communist journalist a couple of days ago claim that she was "simply more than a domestic arrest" because of the news of Anatolia Serdukov's reconciliation with a woman and his return to the family garden?
In his article "Serduks has returned to a woman," said military commander "KP" Victor Baranez, "The followers do not conclude that after this harassment she may become more proficient on questions."
Previously, Vasilieva had been charged with selling the illegal property of Minboron.
Precise ghosts.

A return trend appears to be observed in Flight Centre.
The company has updated its projections for the full year and is looking forward to record incomes from Australia and Great Britain.
The tourist company is now expected to have its main annual income to tax from $325 to $340 million compared with the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If current trends are achieved, this would be a 12-17 per cent increase compared to the record income of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The manager, Graham Turner, said that the Flight Centre received 8 per cent in the first half and started the second half with good indicators, especially on weekly travel in Australia and Great Britain.
“We have been working with income in our 10 countries since the beginning of the year, and some of them are expected to receive a record of high income for the full year before the percentage and tax contributions are paid,” he said.
“This includes Australia and Great Britain, which usually bring us the greatest benefits.”
In Australia, long-term business in the second half of the year has been restored to compensate for a number of weaker domestic corporate travel markets.
In a similar way, in the UK, Flight Centre business in the long term has been a good thing, while corporate clients have suffered less.
Her business in the United States compensated for losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to receive income for the third full year.
Yesterday's Flight Centre shares grew by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police discovered two play rooms.
First, he worked in the Industrial Area on the Road of the Air.
At the time of the check in the game hall.
The 24 cars were in the club.
The second game club was found in the Lenin region on the streets of Anton Petrov.
There were 20 games here.
The Russian Federation on Barnau reported that administrative material was compiled under the article “Illicit organization and gambling”.
Technically.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the Courts of the Industrial and Lenin Districts of the City.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has been severely beaten with two sisters.
After he killed them, their bodies repented.
As reported by the "New Region" in the press office of the GU TV RF in the Sverdlov region, the day after the fire in a three-room apartment on the streets of Uralski, two women were found dead with signs of violent death.
Soon the identity of the missing was established.
It was found that this sister, one of them, was a 44-year-old Ekaterinburg, the second was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
In the hottest room, they went back a few days ago.
His investigation was under the personal control of the chief police region, Michael Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies have drawn up various versions of the murder, verifying the alibi of former convicted citizens and persons involved in such acts.
In addition, it is established what purpose women had to leave the apartment and where they lived before their relationship.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one song of Shakespeare, the 19th - century Romance, the Romance of Rome, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The review will also be presented “external texts” to encourage broader reading.
A single course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to conduct a separate language examination, with the recommendations of the choice of English literature as a separate examination.
In the morning, the Department of Education should issue new training programmes on English and mathematics, the first subject of a radical review.
It will make changes in other key items in the following year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL examinations will present the revised structure of secondary examinations, with a new system of assessments and a lower rate of work.
In the summer, Minister of Education Michael Goov said that there was “a broad consensus that we should reform our test system to restore public confidence”, stressing that school exams would be “more complex, ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours a year or three hours a week) than in most countries.
For comparisons, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirement would be no longer to allocate time in mathematics, the source of the coalition said that the extensive school performance examinations in conjunction with the higher rate in the ratings table would be more likely to serve as an incentive to provide additional education to schools on this subject.
The educational plan will focus on “real life goals, including financial mathematics.
The tickets to the Hague will be served by tourists in 2,200 rubles
From morning to morning, tourists from Bladevestänska to Heahe begin to drive the court to air raids.
This means additional expenses for those wishing to attend China
The ticket on the pump is traditionally much more expensive than the heat.
As reported in Amurasso's reference service, the normal value of the ticket is 2,200 rubles.
The walk through the upper comfort room will be 2,800 rubles.
In fact, the tickets did not travel in this season: the same price was the bus fare of tourists and the last boat, and the last year was the sixth.
Dmitry Medvedev: growth rates for RFFs are insufficient for State development
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that it is insufficient for the RFP to increase its GDP and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business credit conditions and my Russian economy structure, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned to increase GDP by 3 per cent this year, perhaps even a little more.
It'll actually be less than 2 per cent.
On the basis of the recession in a number of countries in general, it would not be very bad, but it is a small thing for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as it is in a number of countries in general, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, receive normal loans at a normal price, that is the first thing that must be done," the head of the Government stressed.

Travel on the shores, rivers and jungle to provide free medical assistance
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical assistance in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwell and his team conduct almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients
Not so many doctors in this West African country — only one per 5,000 people
Advertise here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the 10 major CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 principal heroes to become the CNN-year-old hero.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his work.
During the 21st year, George Bwell saw his father come back to life and again fell into a state of unconsciousness, looking at hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
James Bwelle was injured in an automobile accident in 1981 shortly after Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to his brain and caused a gematus that remembered him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwell.
If we had money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell spent years accompanying his father in completed clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could get.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
- You can leave home on Friday morning, run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bvelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor per 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
And even if the cameras could get to the doctor, many of them wouldn't be on the carnage.
Two out of five people living in that country are living below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the health costs are private.
"Their only problem is poverty," said Bwell.
"And they will not be able to enjoy themselves because of poverty."
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his colleagues, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year Dr. George Bwell and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a co-operative surgeon at the Yaounde Center.
It also established the non-commercial organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to rural areas to provide free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, up to 30 people are in the suburbs, bound by cross-border medical facilities, and taken over to visit those in need of rural assistance.
They're not always successful.
Soon, they were able to drive a car through rivers and rivers.
But when they arrive, they meet them like the people of the Pharaohs: this is a feast of songs and dances, and the best seats for the people of the land.
Free medical services in these forests are indeed a source of celebration, and Bwell is more happy to join in the feast with its wide smile and unlimited energy.
The next morning, Brigadier began taking hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on every trip,” said Bwell.
They come from all over 60 miles [60 km] of the forest, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-to-day clinics provides various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive customs, offerings, or free birth certificates — documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
A simple operation under local anesthesia takes place at night.
Operations usually take place in schools, municipal buildings or at home; then patients get up and go to the post-operative zone in order to free the next person.
Using the generator to light up the operation and sanitation of equipment, Bwell and his volunteers worked until the early morning of the resurrection.
This is an insatiable pace, but the focus of the Brigadiers is usually helping to support wooden musicians.
"They've been in the bathroom all night, so we're tired and we're still working," said Bwell.
The members of the Brigadiers are sent back to the city, standing but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those whom they help.
One person explained that his free care operation would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions in the exit and work at the Bwell Hospital, he also worked nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
This second work, he said, would provide 60 per cent of the financing of his non-commercial organization; the remaining funds would be covered by private contributions.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Melly, a medical student at the second degree of Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in the Bwell group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to earn money for the organization so that these campaigns can be continued.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Melly, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his task, this is an opportunity they would never have had in their home.
"We have been given the opportunity to assist in operations where we have helped to remove five blood or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell," O'Melli said.
As a secondary student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Students of volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often coming with sacrificed drugs.
But when they arrive in Yaounde, their food, transport and training is paid to Bvell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Melli.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help people in Cameroon forever.
For Bwell, almost constant load of work is not a severe test.
Helping others to live a happy life by fulfilling that promise is a source of great joy to him.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” said Bwell.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to ease their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.
Nouden agreed to give evidence of Merkel's hearing
The rebel MP Hans Christian Strebelle met in Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the session, the question was raised whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness to the gender prosecutor of the FRG on the possible hearing of the German Chancellor's telephone with United States Specialists.
Nouden expressed his willingness to provide the necessary evidence.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He clearly understood, said Hans Christian Straebelle, that he knows very much.
Although the National Security Agency led by Kitto Alexander blocked all his movements, Snouden was ready to come to Germany.
However, it began to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding the United States Spanish programmes.
The Senate Disclosure Committee adopted yesterday a bill which introduced additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in the development and deepening of relations in all areas and areas.
In this regard, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Macey, made a statement at the press conference following a meeting with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ahmed Davutoglu, reported that the BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkey relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the authorities of the Government of the two countries would provide overall support and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade-economic contacts between them," Vladimir Macey noted.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that an ordinary 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission, which resulted in the signing of the Protocol, had been held in Ankara.
The Parties have developed a road map of Belarus-Turkey, which, according to the heads of the Belarusian Foreign Policy Office, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and directions of interaction.
"The protocol of the previous meeting is fully implemented, and I am sure that the present protocol will also be implemented, as Belarus and Turkey consider each other to be a reliable partner," he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmed Davutoglu, in turn, reported that the heads of foreign policy offices of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects.
The dialogue between Belarus and Turkey, the Minister's view, was to increase and lead it to an indicator of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is no capacity in this area, he believes.
There has always been a strong relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will continue to grow and grow.
All necessary conditions will also be established for trade and economic relations and for the success of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarus and in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama rejects her statement on health
In the midst of the criticism, President Obama went to a fifth about his frequent, unique promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
As hundreds of thousands of people received notice of the termination of services from their suppliers, the Republicans recently criticized the president for introducing American society into error.
yesterday, Obama made several significant public promises.
“Most people with health insurance who work can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “new life” on the termination of the service, Obama called on the receiving US to seek other options on the market.
Most people will have the opportunity to obtain better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even a cloud than is predicted.
"You will get better conditions," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance can be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not conform to new standards required under the access to medical assistance law.
"Let me tell these Americans that you deserve better," Sibelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who was involved in the implementation of the law on access to medical assistance, said that the launch of an Internet sale site was “severely bad” since October.
She said, “I am upset and upset, just like everything.”
- I really want to return your trust."
The disappointed Sibelius surrounded this phrase, which took the microphone in place by her assistant at yesterday's hall after the heated debate with the member of the House of Representatives of Billie Long, the Republic of Missouri, on whether she was obliged to enter the Obama Health Programme itself.
After more than three hours of listening, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the “architor” of the available medical assistance law had not voluntarily refused from the sponsored government to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now owes to millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has lost the status of the IMI for the non-valued defence
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to recognize an invalid license for the registration of the Rosbalt Agency - Lenta.
In the absence of the SME status agency, Roskomnadsor, for systematic and gross violations of the SME law, was arrested.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was established: the court considered it possible to close the MFI and actually denied the issue of the right to raise objections.
That's Rosbalt.
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened a second headquarters office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also operate missions in the countries of the former SCR.
Since 2001, Robert has developed and worked as the Federal Information and Analysis Agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the best known private internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always taken a very specific footnote: the agency's core exclusive publications have (and so far) made notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Discussions on the proximity of publications to the strong structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to having a broad base of sources in various offices, the project included Natalya Chaplin, wife of Victor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the "Rosbalt" leadership is still unclear: it is often referred to as "the manager of the project".
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, chief editor-in-Office of the Agency, Nicolai Uljanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt did not appear in federal media ratings - either by cititruism or by audience.
In October, the agency took a 25th place in the catering of Russian media websites on liveInternet version.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average audience of rosbalt.ru is approximately 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand reviews), a monthly average of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months, notes on the helplessness of Kremlin in relation to Ukraine, the death of a soloist group of "Kol and Shut" played in the capital of Biruleve.
The "Rosbalta" conflict with the Roscommnadsor began in July 2013 when amendments to the law on media banning journalists from unintended defences were introduced.
At the same time, it found a banned lexicon on two video agency sites (Gigitt from Krassandara and Pussy Riot discovered oil leaks).
The further sides describe the difference.
The Roskomnadzi, on the basis of the found videotapes, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violations of the law on SMEs and appealed to the court to choose a license agency.
In the “Rosbalte” it was stated that the department’s claims were incorrect: first, the roles were not editorial material, secondly, the mother’s words were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the roll warning was removed from the site.
The representatives of the agencies appealed to the Roscomnadsor's claims in the world court - and when Mosgorsud responded to the Roscomnadsor's request on 22 October 2013, the consideration of these complaints continued.
However, 25 of the world ' s judges have already decided not to benefit from the Robalta: chief editor, Nikolai Ulyanova, recognized the perpetrators of violations of the Code on Administrative Offences and spent 20,000 rubles per 10,000 per roll.
Obviously, this has prevented the release of hearing in Mosgorsud - if you give up the idea that the exit could have been banned earlier.
On 31 October, the Court decided to recognize the ineffective evidence of the registration of "Rosbalta" by the media agency.
It can't be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this resistance.
The Agency supported the delegations of the Gosdumas (a statement on behalf of the Heads of the Roscommnadsor, Alexander Jaroslava, signed on 10 October; a document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CPRF).
The Secretary-General of the Russian Federation of Journalists, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Paul Gusev, and the head of the Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov, said that it was wrong to close the publication.
Moreover, according to Goddanova, the Roskomnadsor led him even to some assurance that the case would not be brought to trial until the appeal.
The Rosbalto Court stated that the most secure means of mass information in Russia is now a major issue.
Syria destroyed arms equipment
Syria destroyed all the claimed chemical weapons production powers and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of the disarmament of Damascus ended within a day until the deadline set.
By 1 November Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combatants for use by Bi-bi-si.
The destruction of own stocks or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of WHO, the wastes are currently in sealed containers.
International inspectors were sent to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in the Damaska region on 21 August during a chemical attack, according to the United States.
The main task of inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemicals - and to destroy the infrastructure to mix chemicals and combat munitions.
These productive powers will now be closely monitored so as not to allow them to do so.
The following spring is mid-November: OZCO and Syria must now agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing wastes.
I asked a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They are ready to offer inspectors new verification facilities if the grounds are to suspect that Damascus is not open to the end.
The United States is believed to have been attacked by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case with the Syrian rebels.
The world community had demanded from the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached by Russia, to destroy or introduce all non-working powers for the production of gas and liquids and for the filling of those substances.
Now that this phase has passed, the next step must be the destruction of the already armed Syrian army.
It is estimated that the arsenal may contain more than 1000 tonnes of nerve-paral-resulting substances, each greenhouse gas and other banned chemicals located in several tens of different locations.
Its destruction requires that OZO and the Syrian authorities first agree the action schedule - two weeks - to this end.
Director of Field Operations of OZCO Jerry Smith said Bi-bi-si that his inspectors were "watched individually for the destruction of equipment".
"They do not now have the possibility of further production or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The OZHO statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 facilities in Syria and convinced that the production of scraps and wastes was either destroyed or brought into disrepute.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out the inspection there, but the equipment has been transported and checked by OZHO specialists from there.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of the chemical production infrastructure was “particularly simple” as it was in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but as Smith said, it was time to relocate it to the inspectors before it was found - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the United States spy “has gone far”
John Kerry demonstrated the ease of the tactical protection of the United States follow-up programmes, without prior recognition that, in some cases, the United States spy “has gone far. ”
He also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barako Obama, of having been “in the car” during the infamous announcements by Edward Snouden on the ARB spy activity.
These flows have placed the Government of the United States at the center of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on the video link to the open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and other members of the Government have taken some of the things that happened on the highway, as there has already been such an opportunity — and during the Second World War, and in very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, 11 September”.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government, who recognized that the US spy had gone too far but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, “In some cases, it has been a far-off thing.
And the President of Poland is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain it to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has any sense of abuse.
I believe that there is no abuse on the innocent.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the ABB was acting with good motivation and that its operation saved many lives.
He said, “We are engaged in a new world, where people will be raised.”
In the world there is radical extremism, unreasonable and full determination to kill people, to shoot people, and to attack governments.
And if you were able to recapitalize it, would you keep it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented the destruction of planes, explosions of buildings and the killing of people, as we have been able to learn about these plans before.”
Meanwhile, American legislators are in Europe to assist in resolving the issues associated with the planned United States abroad and convince Europeans that they need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, the Vice-President of the Senate on European Affairs said on Thursday.
The Secretary of State of Connecticut Chris Murphy said he had met with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorist organizations because of the disappointment of the national security agency.
“For the interests of national security of the United States, it is very important that Europeans remain our partners with regard to our common counter-terrorism efforts,” said the Merfi democracy, who served for the first time and was the chairman of the Senate's sub-committee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I go to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these ARB programmes.”
The news that ARB has collected millions of telephone conversations in Europe has weakened relations with some U.S. allies this week, although the head of the agency has stated that they were incorrect and reflected the ignorance of the metadata collected by NATO allies and that they were dealing with the United States.
Other publications were produced by the Snoudian documents showing that ABB was monitoring the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel, as well as the telephones of about 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Investigations, James Clapper, protected spy activities with regard to allies as necessary and said that it was an ordinary case by both sides.
In the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office would organize a tour of the members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the members of both parties and the two chambers would enter into the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be drawn up in the coming days.
According to him, the travel programme is still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some degree of “best incentives” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what Spanish programmes they themselves had been using for many years.
"While we can change our cohesion programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones who are engaged in intelligence," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should be sent to those exits in the Middle East and Poland to address the issue of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as to the United States intelligence activities.
The impact of prisoners will be increased in the new compositions of the Public Observer Commissions
Today, the Council of the General Assembly (OP) can approve the new compositions of the Public Observer Commissions (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
UNODC is public structures that control the conditions of detention in the area of freedom.
In the case of Sergei Magnits and Leonida Dawzaeva, the wave in the Copyo column, namely through the UNC, is explained by the majority of the reasonable events in the decision.
Monitoring over the United Nations is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists.
At the meeting of the working group on the formation of UNOC, I proposed a selection of human rights activities experience.
"They didn't accept it, they formed lists, they didn't create criteria," says Valery Borstev.
The current President of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the comprehensive human rights protection structure of prisoners.
As a member of the House of Lords of Yabloka, he has drawn up a law governing the activities of the United Nations.
The OP Council should vote for the composition of the UNC in 43 regions.
In the 1800s, fewer than thousands of volunteers were required, while in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balkaria were unable to organize competition due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donation to holiday locations.
UNC Moscow is one of the few commissions with competition, although there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borštava, the present composition of the Main Commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 strengths and the option to vote in the OP changed from 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were seeking refuge in the capital commission.
So a new composition may be re-entered by the representative of the "Boy Brothers" Vecheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the United Nations for three years, but he never visited prisoners.
The fighter believes that the forces, appointed by its President, can do the work of human rights defenders, so human rights defenders are not excluded from the commission.
In their view, the movement of force forces is coordinated by a member of UNC Anton Cvetkov, the leader of the Russian authorities, an organization that reflects the interests of the authorities.
"I don't eat young people on my back," said the BBC Daily Anton Cvetkov.
He rejected the promotion of any list and said that it was not intended to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested oppositioners.
According to Cvetkova, he was not even interested in which list now vote in the OP.
He considers the publication of cargo information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the UNOC.
Her former leaders were removed because of the years ago.
The General Assembly concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
And this is the United Nations Rostova-na Donu that can pass from human rights defenders to forces.
One of the new lists of the human rights defenders of the local commission was “proclaimed” and one of his opponents, although in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him from non-ethical conduct.
The list of Moscow and the Borštov Commissions is considered to be “a place for Copenhagen”.
The announcements of the Tolokonnik hope did not have an impact on UNODC Mordovian, who considered it “force”: in the new composition, only one human rights defender, and it did not even receive competition documents.
A member of the OP Council, Nicolai Svanide, told the CBK daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu prompted him.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Paul Gusev said he voted in favour of the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the composition of the list of UNOCs by Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told the CRC daily that it was not right to apply for human rights defenders and forces and to disagree that the Presidents of the Commission had sufficient powers to prevent the work of its members.
Grib is not required to predict the outcome of the OP Council's vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, there will be a change in the vote within the next few days.
Australian Women Appeals against Prison Term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15-year prison on the island of Phuket, falsely admitted that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, applied for trial and was released under bail.
St. Rochelle Bampford was initially recognized by the Pchuket Provincial Court on 15 June in a false claim after the Thai police reported that the local taxi driver had been attacked on the night of the resurrection on 10 June, while two other men had detained her.
However, the video surveillance camera later revealed that she had successfully returned to her hospital after breaking her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police asked Bampford for two days before she admitted that she was making this story.
She was held in local police chambers before the trial.
Bumford was sentenced to a 15-month prison term in the centre of the general regime in Phuketa, not in the female prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the former Australian church of Peter Tanks, who has been called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for the help of her daughter.
Tanks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was “deeply concerned” by the well-being of his daughter and waiting for her return to Australia.
"It was obviously a stressful time, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bumford appealed to his trial and was released in a shelter of 50,000 bats.
According to reports in Australia, at this time she was leaving in the Kurdish area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the court's sentence for two years and an extension of the term for adults.
However, after the recent killing of Australian Count Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand, he may also try to restore his injured tourist image, which will lead to a fair trial.
Roman Secin is now in Paris presenting his novel Eltishev, translated into French.
I remember that this novel became the finalist of four prizes: "The Plain Pole", "the Russian Booker", "The National Besseller" and "The Big Book".
In the past year, the author of this book was awarded the award to the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Sancin is an outstanding leader in the generation of current 30-year-olds and early-olds.
In practice, each publication of its hard work built on the modern life of discourses and speech raises heated controversy over the criticisms of the most diverse directions.
It can be claimed that the combined articles on the Czech Republic and the press, the reviews in its books and journals create a loving and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In discussions on the production of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to Sergei Chiphurin's criticism, most of the words are that its participants understand the word “literation”, which they see now and in the future not only our words but also our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of books did not include most of the articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in a reduction in the sections "Absalica..."
