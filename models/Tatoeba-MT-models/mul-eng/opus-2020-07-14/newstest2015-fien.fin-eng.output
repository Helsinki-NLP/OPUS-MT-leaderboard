Putin: Ukrainian troops bombed civilians
Russia's President Vladimir Putin blamed the country for the fact that they refused direct political discussions with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists.
At this point, Kiovan's leadership does not want to carry out an ongoing political debate with his country in the morning, Putin told the press office in Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-American separatists, who said Kiova and the West were helping the Russian army, tried to work for the Ukrainian troops longer than their current location, where Putin said that the Ukrainian military forces were shooting civilians.
The aim of the Millennium Development Goals is to remove these armed groups and their companies so that they will not be able to shoot the residents of the region, Putin said.
The event was scheduled for Friday and Sunday at Rymikorjam.

With Valioli: Super Raheem away - Mario left behind - Valioli with - Night-Sanomat
The 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered to be the future of an English football team.
White Hart Lane had an electric plane on the sun when Mario Balotelli, who was confirmed by Liverpool, arrived at Tottenham.
Super Marion's initialization was promising: experienced English artists saw a 24-year-old Italian work on the field in a very different position than Manchester City.
Ballotelli was still away from his hospital.
The Italian had eaten only half of its food in three large areas and only half of its food in the group.
The pool fans who have already taken the lead in the game are looking forward to getting better.
Liverpool-manager Brendan Rodgers sat on the Balotelin Barcelona trip to Luis Suarezin's role as the second enemy of Daniel Sturridge's band.
In this group, instead of Balotell, the middle-class diamond crater, Raheem Sterling, who broke into a 3-0-year-old important open country, was about Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it's not just working.
Ballotellia 20 cents shorter English is between the opponent's lines than in the water.
Property is not common to a player who appreciates the noise at best about 34 kilometers per hour [34 km / h].
Rodgers is also responsible for Sterling's development with great appreciation.
The Northern Irelandian reported on the systematic development of Liverpool to Wembley of the growing creative fear of the most popular player in the world.

Lidl's fate in Finland's history
In late February, the turnover of the Finnish companies increased by almost 25 per cent to EUR 1.2 billion during the financial year.
The company published its results as a country.
The EU now has 142 sales in Finland, and the enlargement will continue.
The Member State also said that it paid Finland's taxes of almost EUR 14 million in the latest statistics.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
In most cases, the death of the Munasarsar group is due to late diagnosis and delayed treatment in the areas of the population
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video for the mother who died of ovasary cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women who live abroad have a higher risk of dying from ovarianism than those who live in cities.
Researchers conducted more than 1100 Australians in 2005 ovasarydiagnosed women and found that only 35 per cent of women, or more than five years after diagnosis, were diagnosed.
According to researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, women living in very few institutions and remote areas died 20 per cent more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
OUTER CARTON: New medicines may slow down the stomach and vascular system
The researchers went through the seven years of women’s health history.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, a woman of age was diagnosed at the time, a type of ovarian cancer, prior diseases and socio-economic status were also affected by the possibility of survival.
The probability of survival in older women and in eating with a larger spread of diagnosis was low.
Women living in remote and remote areas died 20 per cent more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to find out why women living outside the city have less chance of experiencing ovarian cancer, but Jordan may have to be responsible for delayed diagnosis and delayed access to treatment.
"Gynecology specialist doctors are the best to care for this disease, and their response is mostly in large cities," Jordan says.
Although the treatment carried out by the post-service service is generally of limited importance, researchers also suggest an increase in the mobility of doctors so that special physicians can treat patients close to these homes and programs to support all patients who are far away.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate of women who have been infected with ovarian cancer is very low regardless of their geographical location, which stresses the need for better treatment and better food prevention programmes.
Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the 33-year-old Gold Coast family of Elisha Neavla, who lived in the Gold Coast, was found to be a bad ovary.
The city of Rovanieme wants to strengthen the railway park in the Friendly Forest, which is located near the hotel in Pohjanhov.
The municipal administration decided that the proposal for a Council of Friendship and its environment should be set up for public service in Oswiitt.
The proposal for a plan asks opinions from the environmental society and the Lapin Centre for Life.
With a change of location, the city wants to allow travel-related motor vehicles to continue in the area.
The site is intended to form a forest area to be included in the present Social Security Council and the area between it and the one between it and the other.
On 15 November and 30 April, the site shall be kept up to 200 motor vehicles.
The area may also be subject to a certain part of the tanking points.
In the new rural area, you will be allowed to take care of your old car.
The city of Rovanieme has fled to the Safari companies in the summer of the summer of the summer.
The Renewable Agreement was renewed in the last summer of 2014 and the Agreement is in force by spring 2018.
The railway park activity and the change of plans have raised a serious challenge.
The residents of neighboring towns have been almost as loud as they are concerned about their emissions.
However, the emissions of the sector have been investigated, and no findings of guidelines have been identified.
The revised fishing quota is even older than that.
A friendly parking area also supports that if the departure site was to be moved longer, the hotel’s holiday guests should move to the resorts of Safari, which would be estimated at 15 departures a day.
The area and the surrounding environment are also large enough for the towns, better than for places to be used for starting places, such as Ounasjo's old-fashioned summer resort.
In view of its position, it is good to see that actions can be extended in the future, for example, to the Ounaspavj region.
The consolidation of the parking operation is part of the approval of the city strategy by the city authority of Rovanie, which aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for the business by maintaining sufficiently high-quality areas in a logical and efficient way.
The roadmap is also marked as the starting point of the motor vehicle race, which has not yet been authorised.
The number of properties can be seen in tree types
The decrease in the number of residents, especially in the 35-year-old group, may lead to a decrease in the trade rate of timber prices by ten million, when young consumers today reach the age of the "heading group". Financial Times reported on the study of the Iso-British Forest Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Time Report, residents are using only 55 per cent of the amount of money to be used by the residents.
The study also revealed that more and more people are living in highly urbanised areas where there are no trees. In addition, the forest is smaller when the front floor is increasingly located in the park. These factors also threaten the forest area, which is estimated at about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the large area of London, property has been reduced by 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years and domestic agricultural products are used for the least money in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Forest Management Board (RHS), increasing or reducing the population of the population in the area does not mean that people cannot grow crops.
The RHS's leading forestry consultant, Guy Barter, says that "for example, growth growth in transferable plants is particularly recommended in the middle of the population, as such growth rates can be taken into account if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the result of the redundancy of the refurbishment of the rural area, as the ownership and ownership of the dwellings increased from the end of the 80th century to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will be affected by better wages this year, as the end of last year's summer of March and April.
Turkey belongs to the United States of America because of the vacancy report
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has invited the country's most experienced diplomat in the United States to provide an explanation of the report on American and British insurance in Turkey.
According to Minister of Finance, the United States of America's major mission managers and the Turkish authorities discussed the report as a country.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the website The Intercept have written that the United States National Security Agency (NSA)'s previous analysis documents of Edward Snowden as the primary source of information services in Turkey are the United States and the United Kingdom.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkey's President Recep Tayip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report by saying that all major countries are weak to each other.
In the past, the German intelligence service was reported to be the most angry reaction in Turkey's government during the siege of Ankara.

Malorcan Magaluf police officer charged with corruption
The manifests of the case provided evidence of a criminal offence committed by the police and the authorities of the city management of the city of Calvian in the late afternoon of the public prosecutor's office in Mallorcan.
The Calvin police officer located in the Malorcan castle has been detained as a result of the corruption of the agents of the Magaulf region known for its advertising.
Professor José Antonio Navarro was appointed to the investigation after several agents of the Punta Ballena Castle presented corruption attacks against him. The Punta Ballena Street is located in the main area of the Magaluvian Bar and Nights.
According to the daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the case revealed evidence that police and city officials in the city management of the city of Calvina had been involved in a conspiracy in the office of the prosecutor against Mallorcan corruption.
The Spanish National Charter held two other local police officers in connection with corruption systems, and they are members of the Court together with Navarro.
ABC's day-to-day broadcast throughout the country wrote about the privacy of the authorities hated by night owners, who were significantly concerned about their business.
"There is no money in this, but to survive," said one of the contractors to the court.
You're not gonna ruin our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in many countries in search of newspapers this summer, when a YouTube video was published on the Internet, where an 18-year-old British playwright had recently spoken to 24 men during the pub crawling.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to stop the use of Magalup’s slotmates by reducing the shareholding of bad, alcoholic pub cracks.
In addition, Playhouse-Ekkerhoho, where the video was described, was set to be closed for a year, and the owner of the night and the Pub Crawl was assigned to Carnagel as a total payment of EUR 55,000.
First of all, the recommended tourist location of the young Brittitus in Magalup has also been recommended for a balconing train, which has caused a number of accidents caused by alcohol abuse when people have agreed on a second or a younger route to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Children of Israel Return to school after the Gaza Strip
The Israelite children in the Gaza Strip returned to their homeland on the day of the summer of the school, when their communities were bombed for 50 days in the war of Israel and Hamas and the schools were still in a state of disreputable war.
The opening of schools caused joy and enthusiasm in the bombings of rockets in the communities of southern Israel, but the results of the wars are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod, in the city of Pasosh, workers removed their backs from the walls and their backs before the children reached the age of the day.
"We are a little frightened but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in Saad-named Kibbuts, in Israeli municipalities, and works as an English teacher in town school.
A lot of children living in this area are desperately in need of routines.
Barti's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that she's been in school for a long time, feels "very strange."
"We have had difficult times when we didn't all go anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited near the Gaza border with the support provided by the Cubans.
By the end of the last week, thousands of residents of the Saad border areas had remained in the interiors or had left their homes in safer areas far from Gaza to escape from rockets and cracks.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Ozi community in the vicinity of Gaza are suspicious of the killing of a 4-year-old Palestinian son in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, the village of ten families had not returned.
The children of these families have been admitted to alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited the school in Sderot, near Gaza border, which was a heavy Palestinian protest.
She invited the children to study carefully and promised that they would "care for children's education and safety".
Israel and Hamas agree to a second future in force as the last of the nations.
The Council immediately stopped fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many open issues, such as the removal of the Israeli and Egyptian island of Hamas' demand and the reopening of Gaza’s air and seas.
Israel wants to escape from the weapons of Hamas and return to the dead body of Israel’s army.
Egypt is expected to start a new inconsistencies negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel had different views about the number of the dead, and at least half of the dead had soldiers, even though they had no reliable evidence of this.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and the other Gazaites shot 4,591 rockets and rockets at Israel’s cities for the most part.
Over 5,000 attacks and other attacks were carried out by Israel’s army.
Israel’s walls damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and from the estimate of 250 000 people were protected from the maintenance of more than 100 UN schools, which had been transformed into temporary shelters.
In the presence of tens of thousands of people in conflict and fighting, the school authorities moved to the beginning of the school last week.
"I hope that school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children in the city of Gaza," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in the city of Gaza.
According to the commonly used meter, the prices of the apartments have increased by more than seven years as a summer month in Australia.
The price of the capital of the capital of Australia, measured by RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, increased by 1.1 per cent in August, and became known as the country of RP.
The increase in prices in the period between mid-, summer and August was 4.2 per cent, more than the same month after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not increased equally around the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne, prices are rising at high prices.
The results of RP Data show that the prices of dwellings rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne last year.
The housing markets in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the most popular; the average price increase is between five and six per cent.
The lowest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent in the year as a result of government deficits.
According to Lawless in Australia, the number of residences in the sale increased during the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in sales of high-sales, generally cheap and still low-sale prices, it is likely that the price increase of dwellings will continue for the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta museum has taken the preambles to the Mänttäntä
The new museum and paintings have brought about the predictable generals of this summer in Mänttänt.
In Serlachiuk’s darkness, over 70,000 visitors have gone to the end of August.
The new Gösta museum was opened in June and there were other classic classics of the pop-tales from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
The following week, I was again told about a trip by the country when 14,500 interested people visited the Etkinen event this summer.
This is not true.
The child has fallen from the door and the windows," says director Paul Sivonen Serlachius.
Sivonen considered that the entire year's journey will take place in the Serlachus museums this year to close to hundreds of thousands.
In the past few years, there have been some 40,000.
There are about 11,000 inhabitants in the Mäntta-Vilppura, located in the northern part of Tampere and Jyväskyl.
President Sivonen reminds us that the new museums are always open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
There, too, is the hope that the art will continue for a long time.
New exhibitions are opened in the middle of pregnancy.
The police were investigating the last four days of security in Kajana.
On Sunday morning, the north side of the road, the traffic was interrupted by a broken window.
The manufacturer had received a small amount of money from the cashier.

On Monday, the police arrested another man who was suspected of the same crime.
I lost my amphetamine to a murder in Kayaan
I need to lose ten grams of amphetamine to a man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to his office and with another man to his apartment and shot him in the head of the suspect's home, a 34-year-old man.
The defendant accused him and accused him of being shot by another man.
The accident became known to the police when the police party stopped a passenger car with a gun that was burning the equipment used in the blood.
In addition to the abandoned fireplaces, the car was found to be empty.
In fact, the Court of Justice of the Kaunas will later give the case.
It was a very rare summer in many places.
According to the Air Station, the average life expectancy is repeated once a decade.
Statistics from the air station show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than the usual.
In most parts of the country, it was one and a half miles away.
Because of the heat of the ice and the heat of the ice, it became more warm throughout the summer than usual.
The highest temperature was measured in the first week of August in Poris, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never loved me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in 1958 in the British Midlands region of the seven children from Jamaica.
Henry's father worked at work and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is doing his best for Rudy's rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on his father's conversation with him and which has been developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The voices are a combination of reggat and rappies in the top of the earbeat.
Henry's got to go through some deep childhood nightmares.
He's been treated several times after his mother died, and he's got a lot to do with his father.
Dad was very hard to read.
His growth has never been seen, but his voice said, "Stop the metal."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who had grown up with me as a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of the weather, or the beauty of the cricket line.
I've never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the funny man on my back, reading his words.
Henry recently opened up a metal sheet in Dudley and was able to deal with what his father's life must have been, even though working conditions are now better than at that time.
It is now a little more important, but it is actually dark, dry, labyrinths that make up the leaves, sand and rock and which bring the mind to its senses.
The father had a chance to go to bed and only to land on his feet, and later he began to sing his own song in his own trash can.
As I walked around, I realized that he had done this work for years to get us food to eat, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood was short - lived.
My father never liked me and never said he loved me.
As soon as my mother became ill shortly before she died, we began to share our love for each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter with Dawn French, and through her child, he has been able to share the love he himself lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Stop it! Stop it!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn Franchin.
Why don't we be friends?
He's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, whom he had been married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good man.
Why don't Dawn and I be friends?
He's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one cause that led to my mother's death.
When I began to suffer from obesity and diabetes, my doctor ordered me to make a complete rule.
After that, I started a lot of visits, and I also had to start a diet to reduce my symptoms.
It's very difficult--
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry.
No one likes to eat oranges.
Henry's familiar, the short part of the kennel is painting his transformation during his development.
Having received a lot of good feedback from the critics, Othello has been dedicated to the theatre.
The following year, there were the Specials Comedys and August Wilson Fences ("Aids").
Making a theater offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedians, which Henry has done throughout his summer career.
Henry started working in the field when he was 16 years old.
One of the trainers noticed him making imitations on the stage and contacted the New Faces competition.
Henry's TV set began in the mid-70s. "How long have I been the only black actor and comet," he says.
Henry learned to work.
I had to grow up as an adult in the public domain, I had to learn to produce visas from the winter of 1975 to 1985, while I was on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henryn's manager had the rights to show The Black and White Mintrel Show, a quick short-term short-term short-term short-term program, so Henry decided to come to the comedy programme for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been involved in it, but I don't miss it.
Although my situation was strange and unpleasant, I was able to do work on major events and learn how to deal with the public.
However, the "Britti-TV awarded, multi-year-old favourites and easy-to-fashioned programme" was the same as "serious parishion of black people".
Henry worked at the 80th grade in the second comedians, where he was also a poet and admiring British culture.
The first section of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and by the '90s, Henry was known as a hacker at Garreth Blacklock in Chef!
The next decade, Henry published a series of lectures, documents, TV series and movies, but in BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now seems to be that you're only going to your place or you're going to go to the website?"
The next day was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not usually taught to us in school properly, and I think it is a white middle class that uses sugarcane and money.
That's why Shakespeare's mind got scared of me.
All the people we interview in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – told me, "Coke.
Don't ignore the whole idea before you know what you're talking about.
You're going to kill me, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry composed 20 pieces of Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I knew I could do this.
It felt like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"That's the point, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your email, do a little research.
So the sampling process was very complicated, and I read the sample months before it was implemented.
The demonstration was finally successful.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't.
A little later, Henry showed up at the Erehdys comedy's.
Maybe I showed up at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At some point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
In one instance, there were technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that his task was to speed up public speaking.
"My little voice in my mind said to me, "You have to spend 10 minutes alone until your computer acts again."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would continue immediately when the problem was solved.
I walked out of sight, and part of me would take care of the relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the show, stay in your role."
Henry "Fences" in the Duchess theater
The training of peers in the "Fences" exhibition was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more stable.
This too was taken very seriously, so it was old as a sign of God; "This is what you have to do."
Of course, Henry says this by the voice of KUMEALLA.
Then I decided to stay here.
I love this work all the time.
I love the operating rooms.
However, Henry is still the top component: the little boys are constantly interrupting our discussion while he exchanges his image with another.
Conformity with the stand-up approach is a matter of concern, as receiving immediate thanks from the general public is at risk.
If you keep pushing it, it can lead to a vampire.
I'll spend a lot of time at Apollo theatre when it feels like it, but generally, I don't take it myself as much as before.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go to the new stand-up.
It brings me real joy to sit together with a guide who helps me to form the whole course of travel, the medium and the end, and I don't think I ever want to let it go.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like to show you...
It's really fun.
The exhibition will continue to tell the story, and there will be a delay in its work.
I love history.
People love stories.
Kenya drew up registers of officials to remove "farm workers"
Kenya has begun to create biometric registers by attempting to remove "farm workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who had not reported to the registry for the next two weeks would no longer have to pay the government's notice.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid for their office.
President Uhuru Kenyat agreed to cut the corruption of the public sector in 2013.
According to a review made earlier this year, the wages of "farm workers" and other economic abuses amounted to at least $1 million a month.
The government suspects that the payments will be paid to the bank after the person has died or left his office, reports the BBC Wadak Chebusiri from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials should be notified within the following weeks of their registration in order to ensure that their data is recorded in biometric registration mode, the notification of the Government.
According to the report, all those who leave this undecided will be removed from the payroll.
"The measure will give a significant public sector understanding because it will determine how many souls actually act in their task; it will also clear the payrolls at both levels of government, thus solving "the problem of workers," says Anne Waigur, the Office of the Ministry for Research and Planning.
The result of the 2015 census may be EUR 25.5 million below, unless the city adapts to its activities and develops its menopause in the green economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget plan, there are some 9.4 million people in the remaining years.
As an enabling mechanism, the scope and level of services were adjusted, as well as the purchases of services, the sale of property and aid, and the increase in tax and tax revenues.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is 8.5 million.
It's not easy in the public situation.
The new obligations imposed on the public, the growth of inadequate tax revenues, increasing unemployment and the delay of five per cent of state participations weaken the vision.
The aim of the financial seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The urban management is unique because savings must be made in time.
The ship must be converted to the objective of the strategy, to be carried out by President Kimmo Heinonen of the City Management Board.
The municipal administration returned the presentations made for the further preparation of the steering group.
The proposals for urban management are based on budgetary reform at the Economic Seminar of the Authority in Frame on 8 September.
After the discharge of the mandate, the budget proposal will advance through the management of the civil service and the administration of the city.
Ten Turkish police were detained under suspected "union" regime
All 33 police have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of the government's "one", local media sources are running.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to the Daily News, the group arrested had 14 high-value police officers.
Some of the police were involved in corruption investigations last December with government officials, including four government ministers.
In July a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey for the organisation of a large crime unit and for the follow-up of calls.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who acted as Prime Minister at that time) said that he and others had been planning an action against Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after lunch.
This is traditionally important for families, and with the benefit of thousands of other Ukrainian seniors, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenuk takes her daughter to school.
At the same time he told the expected suppliers that not all schools have opened up again, but he said he was committed to defending the future generations of the earth:
On the first day of September, the ceremony was not held in each school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
All Ukraine, the entire vast Ukrainian population must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastekhov, who serves as a leading teacher in the Slavian school where the daughter of Yatsenuk is a Russian.
We hope that peace will be restored in the end and that children will be able to receive a lesson that will benefit them in the future.
For the first day of school, children usually write roles, air balloons, and kitchens for teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the vice president was a lawyer.
At the time of this hearing of the charges against the misuse of power, President Rick Perryn of Texas, confirmed by Twitter, was sent a revolving picture of democracy's border examiner from Sunday to Sunday.
The Twitter was later removed, and it was followed by a new tweet, where Perry complained that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent to my cell phone.
"I don't accept a tweet and I've removed it," later in the press said.
Perry's team did not respond immediately to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent to Perry's confirmed Twitter, it's unclear who would publish the picture.
The first tweet included a re-examination film by the border officer Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of a traffic accident in April 2013.
Perry received the funding of the Lehmberg Office when this was refused by the majority, which led to a large meeting of the company in Austin this month in Perryn. Perry is a potential candidate for presidential elections in 2016.
Tweet's search was heard, "Not always in the rain, three times allowed by the largest promulgation rate... but when that happens, I'm sorry about showing Perry the ring."
I'm the most famous democracy in Texas.
The Lehmberg Office did not conduct a major investigation against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a specialist in San Anthios, who was appointed by the Republican Chamber.
Perry has said he's charged and called charges as a political party.
His effective prosecution has asked the court to dismiss the charges and said that the law on the basis of which the prosecutors of Texas's longest office are charged is wrong against the law.
Perry spent 7.5 million dollars on State aid for public non-profits to a unit operating in the Travis region and dealing with public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to separate.
Perry’s decision left the follow-up group to issue an official complaint.
Perry's fixed Twitter style is regularly updated – and on the other hand, it is a good idea.
We will be released to the fifth place at the Ivan election in 2012 during its presidential election campaign, Perry threatened to end her life by publishing a picture on Twitter on her own on a cross-platform of the text "Come to us, South-Carolina!".
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again "normal"
One of London's most important users has warned that the housing market in Kaakkois-English has been "sustained" to a normal level of activity.
The residents of the capital of London have suffered a great deal of demand and a sudden price similar to that of the vast distribution of credit cards, which the Bank of England was able to impose restrictions on the residents in June.
On Monday, President Tony Pidgley, founder of a high-ranking construction company in Berkeley and president, said that "markets and trades have returned to normal since 2013 after 2013" and added that this has made it possible "a strong operating environment".
In London’s residential market, it was a very difficult time for foreign investors to enter the capital city.
According to the Maarekister data, the prices in the cities rose by 18.5 per cent just last year and thus exceeded the averages of England and Wales, which were 6.7 per cent.
The average prices for the private, judge and student buildings in Berlin rose by about five years before reaching the end of April by 423,000.
However, a certain point has been made less attractive to London's property in the last few months - part of the opinion has also influenced new property fees and political returns from the possible "cartanova" before May.
In the last week, the Loan Building Manager Foxtons warned that the April housing report, which included the most stringent loan provisions, would lead to a lower market growth rate, as well as to the sales prices of buildings and prices in the second half of the year.
The UK bank’s recent data showed as a country that the number of approved loans decreased in July, which referred to the five-year housing markets.
The Hamptons International construction operator has been calculated in 2015 at the prices of London buildings. The prices will be calculated by three per cent, as residents' opinion has already begun to measure prices.
The number of trades made in London in the most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfari and Kensington has reached a quarter of the year back, the repairer of WA Ellis tells.
However, in the capital city, there is a blessing to Berkeley, which grew from the sold property to more than 2.2 billion points.
Pigley added that "the best design, demand for a fair product has remained stable and thus the sale has remained weak".
In June, the company reported its sales of 3,742 new homes in April last year, which is almost three times more than the financial crisis in 2007.
In the years leading up to tax reductions, 40 per cent of the profits increased over the year by about 380 million points, and trade shifts increased by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion points.
The day before the company's annual meeting, Pigley told me that the reasons for the year in Berkeley correspond to the current market expectations.
The analysis is the same as that of 450 million pounds of the previous year's tax victory.
The Berkeley portion was sold at a price of 23,96 pounds per day in London.
Hacker by Jennifer Lawrencen Alastonkuvia
Jennifer Lawrence arrived at the 85th Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to hold a hundred other images of the other end of the year, Oscar's exhibitor Jennifer Lawrence was online.
The representative of the football team confirmed that the pictures are real and condemned to the hacker's "grunting of a lot of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and all who publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be brought to trial.
The pictures published from the beginning by 4chan's photo gallery were apparently wrong because of the weakness of the Applen iCloud system. The other application list for Sadam is claimed to be ten other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFed.
I don't know how much of the pictures are true, but actually Scott Pilgrim against the World, the Winsted Court of Justice tried hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at me and my husband in private years then take pictures: hopefully you have a good idea," Winsted said.
However, Victoria Justice rejected the truth of the images and admitted that "these so-called low-tongue images of me are VERSUS, don't you understand?"
Let me do this end right at the beginning.
BizzFedin later Sunday announced that Ariana Granden rejected the truth about the images of the stars.
Only we can express our gratitude for Howard Jacobson's new novel that tells about love and j-books.
They moved, it illustrated the best thing that happened, and at least they went out to each other as if they were left behind in the sand.
Only then did he hear of the woman that she was too hard, heavy, intense, frustrated, and perhaps a little longer.
That's when he ran away.
He knew her little girl.
Yeah, he was as long as he was here.
His last sacrifice was at the beginning, however, a relationship that had been promising; it had been shown that this relationship could have been easy for him alone to break down, and it might have brought his life to some extent.
Solomon had unstinting hair, and he was a very beautiful soul with a joyful heart, of the north wall, which was even more harsh and far more distant than Port Reuben.
He had come to the front with his older traveling partner, who had been his grandfather. This was the garden that was located in the garden but in the paradise floor, and the name of the lake was also suitable for Paradise.
No one lived in the room for years.
As the holes grew, in all the bathrooms there were nocturnals, the ancestors had left behind the windows to keep the whole place in their own hands, and in the woods, there was a growing crop of rice, which reminded the rest of the ice.
It was like children's milk, but at the same time dangerous and dangerous, a tree full of secrets.
Written by Howard Jacobson, who is in Rome "J" as the recipient of the Booker Library Award in 2014.
The proposals will be published in the first week of the year.
Kevin had sat in hand with Ailen in the midst of a violent terrace in their midst, enjoying a wonderful summer evening, both of which heard a gleaming protest, through which the whole earth heard the soothing music and soothing news, when the Christians of Ailinn, the sun-cracked feet gave him a song that had long been forgotten by the black presences and that his father had often heard from the rest of the floor.
Your leg is too big.
These songs were originally too aggressive, and they were no longer called in response.
They were not banned – nothing was officially banned – they were no longer called.
They wanted to leave the dream as if it were the word of the dream.
In time, public opinion gained what had not been achieved by laws and advertising: just as in the course of literature, people chose to read the Holy Scriptures, books, and novels, they also recommended dances for music.
As the day bursting into the wild, Kevern started with a picture of the piano and sings serenadia on the big feet of Ailin with a loud voice.
I don't understand.
"It was a jazzian at Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and greeted him with the same nature two lines in front of him.
So his father had always done before the "j" book had never been drawn from his mouth.
It started playing with him and his father when he was a kid.
His father told him he was playing the same game with his father.
If you saved your mouth with your j-word, and you didn't remember to raise two rings in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay the penny.
It wasn't very fun then, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what Jazz is.
I've never heard of that before.
Jazzika was not originally published as a ban, it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in the form.
There was only one case in life.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's been the same way with the nocturnal.
Its improbableness has made people beautiful.
And Jazz was a loud-speaker through the music.
Although Kevern was not 10 years old when he heard Sammy Davis Junioria, the jazz music had come to him through his father's half-year-old CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
In view of the fact that Aileen’s father was probably not aware of the time when the recommended singers were not black.
There is no need for laws or enforcement here either.
The audience meant that each of the parts accepted as grateful — grateful that they were as though they were already saved by the trade — the principle that each group did to it in its own way.
Based on their temperature and physical characteristics, African-Caribians are able to make people feel better and to play, so they sing and dance.
The original origins of the Indian country were like the nature of handmade electronics, so their task was to ensure that each family had an active phone that was used to handle matters.
Those who were behind the Polish community worked as pukiki men; the last Greeks broke down the machines.
At the time when the SE, the Middle East, JOS TAPAHTUI, came to the truth, they were from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose older ones had not been put to fear that they would be blamed for the crossing of the lakes and fear that they would be followed, opened the restaurants where the labneh yogurt was offered and burned, and continued their lives to be viewed as a wasteland of trust and quietness.
Every document according to its gifts.
The machine had only heard ballasts, and it was hard for him to understand how the words just made by Kevin’s music were never able to play music.
I may have expressed my love.
"They're not really funny," said Kevin.
Maybe you missed the big ones' minds.
My father never kissed anyone, but this song made him happy.
He's already said too much, but the abandoned tree tree leaves an accident for security.
None of the words would go through the silence of the missing newspaper.
I don't know. I don't know.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole case was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two bullets in the back of Ailein.
The plane was gonna take him away now.
"It was my father's idea," he said instead.
The plane was turned into a mess, and his hair was hidden from Kevin's face.
There's nothing more visible in the world than the great world of Ailinn's, a haircut.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you ever say so," he said, "you didn't listen to me with confidence.
But it doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
It turned out that the universe was completely out of control.
Are my legs that much?
He looked at it again.
Your legs are probably not big.
Your smile, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my nose's too weak?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it's been too long for him.
"You're going to have to throw me out of your pockets," he tried to fix the situation.
I've been thinking about it.
There was no help in this.
He wanted it to sound like a ghost.
Often, when he wanted to get pregnant, the effect was quite different, because of him, like his father, he lacked the sure charm that can control vice.
Maybe his father meant to be cool.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted the same.
I don't care if they're blind.
In Solomon’s day, a vine was cut down, and it rose from the ground, and the vine was lost to the vine, and the wine that they had eaten was dried.
The wine was made only of wheat flour, so he could not use it for the bitter reason.
In his nervousness, he seemed as thick as a palm tree’s leaves in the dark.
"And your weakness is what suddenly distracts me from you," he said...
Except I don't recognize it.
He was sorry for Ailein, and for his own unnecessary words, because of the fear that he had seen in this face at the time when Aileen decided to stand against him.
Did Ailin think he could find it?
He had never told Kevin about life in a beautiful Northern island where he had grown up, but Kevin was sure that in the north it was the same as life here.
The same great, fine sea that turned against them.
The same men, indeed, even worse and worse after TAPAHTUNEEN, than their conspirator and terrorist attack, were going to the pubic pub, ready to attack any woman who believed to oppose them or tried to seduce them.
Heads up?
He'd still see a piece of shit if he wasn't careful!
Imuta first – the kiss was usually a word that describes a man and a woman’s unique encounter; the opposite of love ballasts outside the victim’s bombers – first, then attack and then attack.
It was too much for Kevin to think of himself as being an enemy.
The queen of Solomon invited him to leave.
He drank himself on a terrace like an old man.
Ailin's self-esteem too, but the death of Kevin surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They must have known each other.
Aileen followed his way — just as his traveling companion viewed Kevin’s walk up the window — a man who was himself responsible for his difficult life.
When Adam left the tree garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevin and for the people in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to the ground.
The man who turned, the cowardly, the shameless, cut man who had lost all the fighting movements – why did he feel that vision was so familiar to him even though he did not remember that it would have been a few times before this moment?
When Aileen Solomon was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years ago, just before the scene of an intelligent and innovative 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private institution measuring the Common Opinion in Offnow, conducted a brief study on the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in the countries where the reduction of violence, or the end of the decade, was likely taking into account the money and energy used to stop it.
"The palace has already received time, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "that it can be measured thousands of years of fighting and the natural aggression of the most victorious people, especially in the dissidents and specialities of which, despite the vastness of the church councils, is rarely known in time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower it is, the lower it's built up.
The nation cries out in the pair of sensitive ballasts, the stories of successful countermeasures and laments the name of the good things of marriage and family life, but the same old-fashioned publicity is to be seen in the inexhaustible acquisitions of communities and urban communities and communities, and there is also evidence of a new, worse-off approach in homes, workplaces, our streets and even in sports fields.
"You have to complain about the tendency to dramaize," according to his guide's full report.
I'd suggest you read less Romans.
We're Nussbaum looking at the country.
Besides, I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
First of all, we have the right to remain silent on personal matters.
Feminist?
I'll be quiet again.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I reject atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
In this workplace, there is no room for pre-school education.
We are servants of a society that is unhindered.
Although a certain superiority is entirely acceptable and respectful to you, it can lead to the wrong conclusion, to what you just gave me.
You have clearly something against the church – and what you call advertising or vice versa, others usually refer to as natural energy and physical energy.
If it happened yesterday, the rising tide of the seventh century B.C.E. will destroy the earth’s basic habitats.
First, Nussbaum looked around at Rabinowitz.
After the head of Rabinowitz, a flame-flamming LED light was released, which Offnow had distributed to the country for the past quarter or longer of the century.
Play with your neighbors, respect your partners, listen to balls, go to music, use your phone, conversations, explain, listen to you, have the same mind, ask for forgiveness.
Speaking is better than silence and singing is better than writing, but nothing can love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a silent voice when he was sure that his leader had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively improved as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will note the same mistakes that led to the beginning of the SLIHEN, THE TABLE, JOS TAPAH.
This time we really don't hate and doubt each other.
Luther Rabinowitz was formed into a pyramid.
This was the end of patience.
"You go too far," he said, "in your image, 'to the wrong' of the deeds that our ancestors may have done or were not done.
You also go too far as you say that they have provoked 'his hatred and mistrust to others'.
In your case, you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we do not speak 'man' or 'men'.
There was nothing "we" and no "other".
It was a time of chaos, everything we know about it.
"If we're really real, that's where we're going," Esme promised to continue, "any group of society can't say that they used well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done, done, then was good or bad.
It was then.
We don't need to talk about it anymore. We agree with this.
And just as there is no need to distribute charges, there is no need to make corrections, then they were serious or not, and even if there was any way to do so.
But for what, then, is there to be, if it is not taken as a lesson --
The past is in place so we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz took the pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said that Esmen was time to leave.
The next day he went to work in a normal way, he became a foot-and-mouthed motorcycle driver, who used to be described as a "clean and rigid" driver.
It's happening.
The Lesotho army refuses to plan for the day; the Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The authorities of the Lesotho army have refused their defenses and have said that they are acting against the police, who are suspected of trying to shoot political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane told my country that the army had restricted his official residence and had destroyed government buildings in the capital of Maser.
The Head of State traveled with his family to a neighboring country in South Africa after he was told that he had received a death sentence.
The army's representative, Major Ntlele Ntoi, refused and said that the army was so dangerous that it was the last of the "political fanatics". The police have been told that they were trying to shoot the enemy.
"The Lésotho defence forces launched a series of intelligence reports that some police authorities wanted to try to put young sidewalks in order to cause problems," he told Voice of America.
According to President Clayson Monela of the Government of South Africa, the military activities appeared on the government agency.
"Even though no one has claimed that he is the most powerful ruler of his empire, the activities of the Lesotho defence forces show the recognition marks of all sides of the State-owned company," he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho Army, soldiers return to the army on Sundays, and in the capital city there was a peaceful feeling.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing is taking over the administration of the Taliban.
Thabane says he believes it's for action because he's been trying to fight corruption.
In Lesotho, there has been a show of zeal since June, when Thabane stopped the meetings of the delegation because of the differentialities of the government of the major coalition.
He rejects the government's authority in this way, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Trade book: Microsoft builds a data centre in New Zealand
Microsoft's information technology acquisition has established a large data centre in a new country, where the company does not agree to revise its location.
When sending Microsoft to the media, the company does not tell all its databases about safety.
The centre according to Microsoft is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
The public centre was previously operated by Oulu or Kajania.
Microsoft ends up at Oulu's office, bringing about 500 people to work.
All Microsoft has announced its ironic name in Finland at least 1,050 jobs.
Microsoft correspondent Camilla Lindfors tells the STT that the company does not comment on how many staff are working on the new database.
On the basis of the establishment of the Data Centre, New Zealand reported to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday.
A man accused of a girl's ex-girlfriend in a traffic accident
From 78 years of age, a man is accused of being a three-year-old girl in a traffic jam in Fifes.
Gordon Stewarta is charged with getting a girl on the road in the ancient Neuk in Pittenween.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart drove Audi Q3 without warning and caused the girl to have an abortion.
Stewart, 78 from the Anstrothers, refused the charges at the Dundee Sheriff's seat.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC appointed the appeal in January.
Four angles for the best water pictures and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under the water, you have several different options to choose from.
The preferred option is waterproof, compact point-and-shoet camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both pay about 300 dollars.
I took these pictures myself at home using several different cameras, each of which paid less than $350.
There are several rules that support compliance, regardless of the device.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you should have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera window and other parts are closed in a waterproof manner.
In addition, set the camera's description settings to respond to the pictures or videos.
In some cameras or cameras and video cameras, there is a regulation that optimises the conditions under the water.
In addition, before you touch the water, make sure you take your hard drive.
Some cameras only endure 5 wall thickness, others even 50-60 wall thickness.
Known both to the normal and water-based models in our shopping cart and in the evaluations of digital cameras.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have an LCD display that allows some to picture when the action cameras do not often have this feature.
Even if you have LCDs, it is difficult to see under the water, and some of the images can either succeed or fail.
Then take a few pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows you to take a haircut, which means taking a lot of pictures on various regulations, use this feature.
Stay close to the floor.
The air is significantly reduced in the heart.
If possible, stay close to the surface in your picture in a river, lake or sea.
So you can also see more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the picture.
This is important advice in describing the country, but even more important under water because the weather conditions are weak.
It is very important when there is an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens, which has a wide picture, i.e. the artist must be close to the point in order to fill the entire surfaces of the picture.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leader – old-fashioned costs
The Chinese Parliament decided on Monday that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite the democratic reform required for peace.
The decision is likely to give rise to long-term protests in Hong Kong's business district by planning and implementing the opinion only after the decision has been published.
The decision of the People's Congress of China is in effect giving the Communists the power to withdraw all proposals which are not accepted by Beijing.
"This was expected, but it is still cruel," said the president of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what you promised Peking.
They've lied to Hong Kongans.
It's clear that we're working with our own government.
Mr Li Fei, Vice-President of the People's Congress of China, supported the Chinese Government, saying that the general proposed position in the election of Hong Kong's leader would be too "stupid".
From 1997 onwards, when Iso-Britania was founded in Hong Kong, Beijing promised its citizens that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic transition, as Hong Kong could vote in large elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to closely monitor elections through the Committee on Appointments, which is managed by Beijing.
According to the new resolution, only those who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In Hong Kong, the previous summer of the decision, some of the largest and most noteworthy protests in the region were held for years.
Behind the campaign to defend democracy was a large part of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which the organizers have threatened to prevent the operation of the world's cardboard, unless Beijing does not grant Hong Kong the true right to vote.
On Sunday, just after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered at the port in front of Hong Kong’s headquarters.
In the opinion, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement was transferred to a new statelessness period and that they would receive protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not clearly tell details that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a network release, the organizers said that the movement "holds the Octupy Central rate as the last way to be used if there is no hope for dialogue and no other knowledge".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has come to an end and that the rule of the debate has to be taken place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and Sunday security measures were strong near the government's capital buildings.
In Hong Kong, a lot of people feel that they are in the process of losing power in their city.
The decline in manteries has led to competition for products and services.
Moreover, living in fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are losing weight under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central move because its views threaten Hong Kong’s survival — a world of commerce.
"The protest they speak can lead to the greatest economic losses, depending on how many take part and how long it lasts," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long considered trade.
We don't want the public to worry about Hong Kong getting out of our way.
This would be a bad idea to invest in.
The Chinese state media has also provided stories that Hong Kong democratic activists are the leaders of the Western Powers of the ruling Powers."

In June, tens of thousands shared in the spirit of support for democracy in the region.
U.S. prom-prenexes to British universities: details for new students
We are encouraged to answer our question by setting up the first type of travel in Britain for students today.
The company also offers other routes, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure that the customer is able to reach the university as soon as possible.
According to Stewart, there is also a security point in the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise gain property in the country rather than in cars loaded with cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP-friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy as possible and high-level transport.
According to the company representative, the funds have not yet been received because the service has not yet been established, but you added that "the students will start working for solutions during the following weeks".
The company believes that service is required, even though most students pay 9 000 pounds per year.
Students today have been very different about their expectations and hopes than 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create an innovative first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization has criticized service that is not realistic.
“This service plan has a very far-reaching impact on the life of more students,” according to former Vice President Megan Dunnin.
In this month, many of the start-up studies will be motivated by the cost of living when the financial support in the form of wages and pensions has remained after a bad rise in basic costs. On the other hand, it is possible to start thinking about how thousands could be used as simple as to getting to the camp.

Hundreds of prison workers around Bulgaria have shown their opinion in front of the Sofia Ministry of Justice.
In a spirit of peace, they announced that they wanted to return to the old working regulations that had recently been amended.

Corapalo: Fani's encouragement is almost too much: Sasu Salin was turned to the countryside
Corapalo Sasu Salin today was the victory of Finland.
He was able to forget his American occupation and shed the blood of the second half of Ukraine on a stand-alone solution.
But Sally moved everything to the Susifans, and he did it the way he did:
I mean, I was going through the end of the mountain, and that encouragement was so great.
But in my eyes, I couldn't do anything.
That metal and the white general was almost too much for me.
The effects of the saline were to be included in the nine surfaces in the quick-to-be, pallets, sheets, and roofs at the place where they occurred.
I don't know how it went that way, but I got to the floor so it all worked out.
They'll come sometime, now in an undisclosed place, Sasu's failed.
It's my role.
Do everything you can.
Now it was great to see that others got caught.
It's all over the place.
Salin is a group of gladiators and spirits, so it is not surprising that his example led the entire group to a flight that was too big and heavy for the five of Ukraine.
Finland in MM-kissos after 32 years of age: In the past, I thought that there was a court case
Heikki Montonen (formerly) was the capital of Finland in Argentina's MM market in 1982.
It's been 32 years since Finland's men's airport was saved for the previous time in the MM crash.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in 1982 in the tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was a Finnish football player and the current player agent Jouni Parkka as the general player.
Kosonen and Parkka recall one thing like the last day: it was at the beginning of the course of action against France.
"The judge's game in the decision-making camps was small," he reminded Koson.
We've already won, and both teams have already set up a safe.
Yeah, well, maybe the game was going on, too.
We lost it 2-3, and then the rats kissed more," he told Parkali.
Finland was saved by Prime Minister Heikki Montos's commander and finally invested in 17th.
Now Finland is again in a group of world elections, when Poland's MM tournament is on its way today.
Many factors have changed dramatically during the 32 years of international aviation.
The power values of the players are as planned as before, but the quality and skill are now greater.
Player's centralities have also increased.
The game is faster than before," considered Parkka.
But how's it going in Poland?
The Finnish player's material has been expanded and the pregnancy can be shared.
I'm waiting for Finland to go on from the beginning.
Then it can be tough," he said to Koson.
Sepo Sirka
It was Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen, and Jukka Savio who were in the battle against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkali was a general player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope we're going to lose 17 places.
South Korea and Tunisia should go naked," Parkali said.
Leilanda Reino Kosonen was a two-year-old farmer in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Krkkök were in Tunisia.
Health and entertainment in the Buenos Aires Seabed, a group of farmers formed a programme in the MM market in 1982.
Kari Kalin (Oct.) joined his teammates.

The financiers still spread competition songs.
The competition is always a great memory, Immon says.
Finnish tourists saved from the city of Cita in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When young Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog walked on the beach, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered a great help.
On Saturday, Mikkelsen was looking for "national sandwiches" on Facebook so that he could thank his assistant again.
Mikkelsen reported on his Facebook update that he had suffered from Cita-koira on a mountain with him.
The lost sheep were no longer able to walk in the wilderness.
I tried to put it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to jump and take it a little further, but its feet didn't just stand, Mikkelsen writes in his journal.
Mikeksen says that help did not come from the police, from a nearby hotel, or from the police station.
The situation in the dark of the East has already begun to seem dangerous.
Happily, there were two runners who were ready to help: the drummer Antti Soini and his father, Tuomo.
The men were visitors to the highest mountain in Norway to Galdhøpiggen and headed to the beach when they saw a woman and a dog at the middle of the mountain.
(Mikelsen) was relatively peaceful in the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells us when we sent him to the night-Samom.
In a short time, a German man who had a motorcycle also arrived.
Several cases were sent to Cita, where the wounded dog was arrested.
The Germanman came to our place a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and put the dog down a minute from the bottom of the line, Sonia tells me.
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: SENIN
The dog was taken under the wing by a helicopter.
According to the call, the operation was not physically difficult, but in the difficult territory, it was slowing down.
However, after about half an hour, Cita was successfully released.
After his death, Mikkelsen was still looking for "national sandwiches" on Facebook so that I could thank them again.
The calls were also answered to him on Sunday, but the Germans are obviously still unintended.
I don't know what I would've done without these sandwiches, Mikelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel that I didn't thank them enough.
They probably don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all praise and honor, I am always grateful to them.
The other night of the country, the soybeans were already at home.
They've got the happy parts from Mikkelsen:
Susanna Mälkı is presented as the highest-ranking star in Helsinki City Orchestra.
One three-year period would begin in 2016 and end in the summer of 2019.

Absence of genetics is often misdiagnosed
The British woman was afraid of dying for years because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years of life behind him because he had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, he suffered from the disease of Charcot-Marie-Prototh (CMT). It means a number of family diseases that damage brains and distinct external nerves.
According to the Charity CMT UK, the wrong diagnosis is a general problem in CMT cases because they are known to be so little.
According to estimates, about 23,000 people in the Iso-Britania suffer from CMT, which causes motor disorders, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and skin cramping.
The people may also cause ignorance or confusion, and it is unhindered and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was ill with Friedrey’s Ataxia (FA), which has a really bad percentage of survival.
Rodgers believed that he was on a journey before he was 18 and died before he reached 30 years of age.
At the age of 51, the mother of two children says that "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I lost every day, and I've had everything longer than others.
I was never able to ride or ride with other children, and I was tempted in school because I walked and walked in different ways than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was executed by several employees in order to have his legs cut. The doctor’s room with the toys would quickly be used to carry out his research papers, where he was told about his painful FA condition.
"I felt guilty because I was so drunk, so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home to check the disease information in the library and wrote to the FAO union," he says.
When I got the information from them, I was upset and panicked.
I thought I had to go around 18 years of age and die before I reached the age of 25, and in the meantime, I would lose my full capacity.
I went through this myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he realized that his behavior had not been as bad as he thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just grabbed me and said, "Diety gold, I don't think you have this disease, because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you've suffered something much less from a serious illness.
Based on some genetics, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what the CMT was, I thought I was upset," he says.
Charity CMT UK organises the CMT month to focus on the disease.

Nastolan's honorary administration was granted to Valtteri Botttak, 1.4 hectares of rantatonton from the Kärkjärve train from Willäkete.
The government showed the race from the sports field and was unique in its decision making.
Soræans did not attend a meeting at the end of the tunnel, told the Honorary President Paul Syyrik.
The bott's donor has the building of the planet - all of the seven pillars.
The country's still beating them this year, except for the number.

The Russian space station failed - the geek sent to the sex scene died.
The five small geeks sent to Russia to increase the space of Russia are dead, reports the Russian Federation's Space Agency Roscosmos in its report.
The gestics traveled with the photon-M4 satellite for over half a month.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning in Finland.
The purpose of the test was to study the growth and use of geeks in an unpressed state.
One of the students and four girls participated in the trial.
Even though you sound like an eagle, its purpose was serious.
The effects of stresslessness, for example, on the development of bone marrow development are somewhat known.
Through the effects of the ghettos, an attempt can be made to predict the effects of the stress-freeness of human beings in this longer period of time, revealed in July of the New States.
According to Roscosmos, the death and death of the geeks and the syllables will be discovered.
According to the news agency Interfax, the "sex-to-sex" Christians were left behind.

France held a terrorist mission at the Nizza airport
France held terrorism at Nizza's airport this morning.
A 22-year-old man who was suspected of acting as a recruiter in Syria.
The French authorities have informed us of this matter every Sunday.
The authorities came after the man was caught by a 16-year-old girl from Syria.
The girl was about to fly to Turkey and cross the border with Syria.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but the authorities warned her.
The authorities contacted a girl’s father, who was completely unaware of the girl’s intentions and told the authorities that there was no family in Turkey.
A man, according to the authorities, is home to Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French authorities had followed a man's action earlier.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that young people who are attracted to the Iraqi or Syrian war also pose a security risk to France.
The authorities considered that about 800 French citizens or French literature had visited Syria during the last conflict, returned there, or planned to leave Syria for the best time.
Koponen: We have good opportunities to win
The hopes of the Corporal Group continue to be played when Finland faces the MM summit today in the second round of Ukraine.
If the opening of the U.S. has been expected, Ukraine will also belong to countries from which Finland should take the necessary gains.
Ukraine is good, but I think we have a good chance to win, Peter Kopon's ahead.
Ukraine won its first bid on the cheeses on Saturday, 72-62 in the Dominican Republic.
The team prepares for my NBA-veterate Mike Fratello, who is part of Ukraine's aggressive corps.
Ukraine's opening player is President Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a hundred meters away from the world champion for three years.
The Dominican government against Jeter got 16 points.
Poh Jeter is quick to leave, but yes, we've been saved from such things before and we need to get our standard security on the wall, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttöle promised that Finland would play better than in his previous death to the United States.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can assure you there's a normal syllable on the ground, Möttöl said.
Hollywoods claimed to be covered in the net, part of which is guaranteed.
On the Internet, a group of low-tongue images are claimed to be made available to the public.
In particular, the exhibitor Jennifer Lawrence has become a victim of a "smoker" campaign.
The TMZ website has published an angry comment made by the representatives of Lawrence, which would demonstrate the reality of the images.
This is a small detail gap.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence, comes to be accused of threats by representatives.
According to TMZ, Mary Elizabeth Winsted has confirmed that the widest pictures of her are real.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know these pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible pain was seen for this.
I feel grateful for all those who had to be victims of the search, he writes on the page.
Instead, Victoria Justice, an exhibitionist, says in his own name, is a fake.
Auxiliaries or counterfeited undertones are also moving at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunstista, Ariana Grande, Hope Solos, Kristen Ritters, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
"They don't do enough work to get out of here."
FC Honka is currently at the last location of the Veikkauslica.
The comments made by the World Bank Walter Vital on the following Sunday after the VPS operation are very closely described in the current report.
I haven't had a World War II in four months.
But everything needs to be adjusted," Viitala said after the end of the campaign on 1-2.
The dog made a lot of defense errors, especially in the first half of the race.
The World War I Viitala was not a bad defense game in his mind.
You have been in Hong Kong this summer, and that is why the defenders in Vitala have also changed to a very serious wish.
After the game, many young players have also been given opportunities that they do not necessarily deserve.
"The part doesn't do enough work before they ever get out of here," Viitala said without calling anyone a private player.
The Hong Kong Prime Minister, Shefki Kuqi, was some of the same opinion as Vitala.
"I told some players after the game that if you come to the trains and games to keep your fun and you think you're an easy player, and you don't have to do anything, you must be in the wrong group," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of time to a young man.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players cannot expect immediate success when gambling is constantly changing.
There have not been the same meeting twice since this time.
In particular, there has been a change in the scope of defence.
It's the biggest reason why we're here," Kuqi said.
After the VPS stop, the dog is a serial number, on the other side with the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left behind, so the Espolas still have time to avoid falling to the Union.
I've never dated a team, and I'm not going to shoot right now.
We're not really going to get caught up in this series," said the World War I. Vitala.

Lars von Trier, 58, has been well-known in recent years as a leading media player and is depicted as an anti-christ and Nymphomaniac.
On television he led the Kingdom series in the early 1990s.

So said Corporalist Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played in the EM-based battle against France in the Athenian Maroussian Palace.
No connection to the Army.
I remember the game when he was on his way.
Also, they were about a hundred of the Finnishs who called 20 000 spectators to the water, or empty metal of the hall.
What would the Pekhkon have said 19 years later after the Finnish Ukrainian occupation of MM-kissos?
In the city of Bilbao, the hundreds of Finnish fans are eight-year-olds.
The EM-C 1995 was the time of the Finnish Corps.
The men fought their way to the end by winning the win, including in the Russian casinos in Helsinki.
This victory would open doors to Europe.
Everything looked good.
He was a promising young man, like Hanno Möttö.
The Chief of Staff, Henrik Dettmann, served as a member of the Möttölsk People's Party for the final term of office.
It's an excuse that many of us used to think differently.
Now you can say that Dettmann was a long way off, even though everything didn't work out according to the manual.
After the athene, the corrosion of the spine caused a heart attack.
In the Athenian regions, the Germans were known to have over a hundred dogs together.

Here's to explain to sports psychologists.
In the global economy, businesses move across borders.

It's funny, too. It's supposed to be a vegetarian.
I'm proud to be part of the popular culture of sports.
It's easier to go to sports than to Berlin to look at art.
Without success, however, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, Prime Minister Dettmann called for the Corporal League and for the players to be thrown off by professionally.
It's been ten years.
Then the direction was changed, and the rural group was lifted to the foot.
The plane also made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoyed the fruits of their labor.
As Ikonen says, both men have succeeded in producing their hip-song, where holy trinity acts: sports media sponsors.
The public is also interested in that.
And the media have taught me what it's like to support such a criminal regime, to remember Ikon.
Can the dolls also move this massive interest to the home ranges?

The other school believes that the event is a move of interest.
The other one's the one who doesn't want to make the earth full.
This package is ready for the MM-kissos, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series do not have a double interest.
There's a challenge for the follow-up in the middle of nowhere.
Ton of the boat - about 1.5 hectares on the shore of the river
Nastola pays the form driver Valtteri Bottas with a credit card.
The government unanimously approved a total of 1,4 hectares per day at the conference.
Tonto will build a free-time apartment in the future.
Nastola has been following Bott's success since this carding period.
He's trying to be sent to market Lataka, Lahde and Nastola.
It's located in Koskalas, on the Kärkärve coast.
It has become part of Nastola's honour to be part of his own real estate.

Set How to Save in Schools
The costs of university studies in the United States exceed $1,000 per student, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second year of studies, will set aside the cost of saving.
He developed a system in which students of later years borrowed books from a nominal replacement instead of selling books in front of the same route.
"My math book would normally have paid $180; I paid for its use as a total of $10 and a thousand," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies the Coverant College of Georgia.
Schroeder says his last book would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he used $120 for them.
According to the university’s board, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on education and training, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly starting to use online chat rooms and similar creative approaches to Schroeder's idea.
More and more students buy books, where they can use the book all the time and pay it clearly less than the students who buy the book.
According to the Neebo Inc company, more than 250 campaign books are sold, the number of students is doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field show that about a quarter of the books of the university's books were written on Friday, the president of the Neebo company Trevor Meyer told them.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campuses.
This is the easiest way to save money.
Network Connections
In online shops, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would pay for the campaign's book sale.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler's nine-year-old "Calculus" book is about $290, but the price of Chegg.com online is $239.99.
Buy for use
The books used are a good option if readers do not disturb the memory of other people and spend the rest of their lives outside.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used for the sale of Chegg.com at $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, tells her buyer the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" used in Amazon.com for sale only $0.42.
The new book would have paid $48.
Professor Amherst's College Without Walls, director of the University of Massachusetts, Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use the previous pressures at the course.
In other words, the reforms of the new emphasis are not essential for education.
In this case, the weight of the old can only be found in the difference of the price which should be reimbursed.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon libraries, eBay Inc's Half.com is recommended for the purchase of the used books.
Vaccinations
If you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them at your course.
You can save over 80 percent of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book to the entire library costs about 20 dollars.
Known to the rules of the subsidiary, such as reminders, the use of pressure and the consumption of the following charges.
If you forget to return the book, the delay payment may be greater than the price of the book.
E-mail
Getting e-mails instead of standard papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are purchased, where the right to use an e-book is paid to its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
From Chegg, you can obtain an e-book of "Calculus" for about 61 dollars a month.
According to Bracey, many literacy students are most able to save because many classes can now be downloaded free, while the books in science and technology can be very expensive.
The comparison of different sellers supports the choice of the option.
Joe Gault, 29, who is soon starting in Pepperdin's legal data, recommends using a good letter to find the ISBN number, since it can ensure that it is looking for the correct letter.
Before you can find a network, make sure the book is in stock, Gaul says.
He's learning himself through this piece of shit.
The supply of his book was in four weeks, and he finally had to purchase the book at a full price at the university’s store.

The heavy ports were able to surprise the Russian authorities, and no prior warning from the ports was given.
The day-to-day meteorologist Ari Mustala of the Finnish Institute of Sciences considered that the affected region was very local.
The sand area looks on the roof and on the ground.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France," said the head of the Netherlands
Valls warmly called on the left side to "show his feelings" for the Socialist President in difficulty, who at the meeting of the new government did not receive the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our task is to stay with him," said Valls and earned the Applods.
In spite of the 35-hour working hours of the French opposition, the prime minister was asked to leave the government alone this week, despite the fact that the new Minister for Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron had given the debate on the resolution proposal that the rule should be maintained.
On Wednesday, the Netherlands asked socialists to work together with the government.
However, the Ministry of Justice, Christiane Taubira, has given special attention to the meeting of the socialist representatives presenting different opinions and criticising the socialist side of the fact that it allowed France to hope for the future.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the state-of-the-art nationalist movement, pointed out that the socialist movement continues to differ, and said that Vallsi did not believe that the new government would endure for a few months.
Francois Holland has gone to the war, but also Manuel Valls, who had the responsibility of forming a new government after a long period of time.
"And no new government will endure the drought or winter," said Le Pen to the suppliers.

At the video, visitors Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to heal Huomenta Suomen's reputation for the next day, but the healing does not go very far.
Alm-Siira learns in his words when he tries to sing the words of his budgets, and his collection is also allowed to lose his kiss after the second time.
And these signatures should be allowed to pick up a direct message tomorrow, as stated in the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has been very popular on Facebook, and it is also popular that it has been shared over 10,000 times on Facebook.

There's Israeli Prime Minister Gold Meir in the picture.
A meeting of the Socialist International in May 1971 was held at the building of the building of Fredrikinkadu.
There was a lot of government officials at the meeting, and security measures were great.
When Golda Meir went in the water, seven guards went with him.
However, at the beginning of the meeting, we were able to take five minutes to describe the time.
I took this picture four meters away.
The light and the rain were in place.
I just realized I was successful this time.
We have seen that the leaders of the Middle East have had a lot of difficulty in the past.
Then, in the contest, you came across a picture of the people you knew or the events you had.
It is great that today you can also succeed in other ways, as there is an idea and a visual response.
This is the best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's painting of the Olympics in Munich.
I didn't send that to the competition.
Finally, the Aarno survey has already paid more than EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the Helsinki police unit has already paid more than EUR 5 million and has demanded 30-50 personnel.
Thus, Jyri Rajamäki assessed the University of Jyväskyl in the Department of Information Technology.
The framework suggests that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by harmonizing research and judicial information systems.
According to the limit, modern technology enables the multi-use of a criminal substance.
He argues that it is possible to build a system where the information needed to detect the crime is automatically filled with electronic evidence and also enables comprehensive legal oversight.
Maybe we'll check it out tomorrow night.
More: 1999 on the growth area was forgotten at the school level: "fish and canary species belonging to the Cassvised diet"
The picture of a shopping school in the town of the Women's Republic of the United States was based on special information on food in the social media, told Yle on the website.
You're growing up!
Fish and Canary Islands, which are part of the school curriculum, have been developed.
Only when there's meat in the list, we're preparing a growth change!
That's how the school's gone, 15 years old.
I think you'll be able to look at this.
Social media has been able to send people back to the town of Pirkla.
The head of the food and cleaning service Arja Varma tells Yle that the forgotten child does not take his place and should have taken away time then.
Obviously, before my arrival, there have sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed during the discussion with health care.
Every student gets his office according to his wishes, he'll tell the Lord.
On this day, in the school of Pickala, students are offered an alternative to a change of age only with the consent of their parents and with the consent of a doctor or a healthcare professional.
The burden is based on the solution to the General that young people’s growth experience may leave the need for treatment and the lack of meat or meat can awaken the wonder of the students ’ parents.
Norway Cruise is close to $3 billion from the Prestige Cruise Agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest railway company, makes negotiations to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc at $3 billion.
With the purchase of the Norwegian Cruise company, which is a market value of $6.8 billion, Prestige Cruises would be used by luxury investors and the customers would continue to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
According to sources, information on the possible agreement can already be published this week, and it is also possible that negotiations do not produce results.
Prestige Cruises owner, the private company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise company.
The sources did not want a name for the public because the negotiations did not take place in the public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company has 13 railways covering North America, the Mediterranean, the East, North America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with a turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which is currently operating on Miami, stands for the Oceanic and Regent brands, which are part of the total of eight railways, and the road map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Netherlands, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
An estimated $29 billion worth of rice industry is expected to benefit from the growth of developing economies in the coming years, such as China and India.
Companies compete to save these new customers' collective exchanges in their choice of bicycles.
Prestige Cruises registered in the US shares market for the first shares in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares after the 2007 trade, which was worth 850 million dollars.
Norwegian Cruise was founded at the present meeting in 2000 together with the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. Next is the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thayn and the casino company.
Apollo invested billions of dollars in the Norwegian Cruise company in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, the share of Genting in the company was 28 per cent, Apollo 20 per cent, and the share of TPG Capital LP was 8 per cent before the end of June.

The Tampere City Department is dealing with the matter today.
The animal hopes that the city management will begin to support the prison.
According to Sala Tuimovaara, the time of the delfinaries in Finland and around the world has come to an end for a long time.
Over the last few years, the world has been lucky to see that the level of dolphins that developed like dolphins in dolphins has not been highly protective and highly sustainable.
I would also like this view to appeal to Tampere.
The suspension of the Delfinary is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a point of departure.
According to the Court of Justice, the death of Nassi-delfin confirmed the requirements of the delfinary action.
I saw death as a terrible continuation of the history of Särkönniem's delfinary.
It is time to put a point to death, close the dolphin prison, and find out how Tampere's dolphins could be transferred to the sea area, some sort of dolphin shelter, the Toimivaara requirement.
The nose did not have to try to return to the original life environment of dolphins, but hopefully the end of the dolphins living in Särkänjenje were also tested by other lives other than the inexhaustible Bethel, the Doomivaara hope.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association is to prohibit the use of all wild animals in the circles of animal protection in the presence of preparations.
This group also includes delfinaries.
In support of the request, the Executive Director of Animal Health will take part in the opinion of the Delfins, which is scheduled to date 1.9.
In Helsinki, Japan's largest shipping company is represented in its opinion against the dolphin fishing industry in Japan.
During the harvest season, about 2300 dolphins are being imprisoned or killed annually, whether for use or for food by dolphins.
Putin requires Kiova to open negotiations on a new state with Eastern Ukraine
Russia's President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separates in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the different "stateship" region, the Russian renewables begin.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that part of Russia should be part of the eastern Ukrainian region, but that its position within Ukraine should be based on the ground again, so that the Russian-speaking region could be given the power to defend its own rights and interests.
The request made to the Government of Putin Kiovan to negotiate with the Russian capitals as a equal negotiating partner is in line with his apparent strategy, which he has followed up until five years ago: he is trying to help the separatists rule the region and thus compel the Government of Ukraine to give the contrary to the declared independence of Novorossian, which it can direct to the west of Russia.
In an interview with the Government of Canava 1-TV, Putin decided that the Ukrainian army's attempts to reinstate the former Donetskin and Luhanski region, which the separatists ruled in Moscow on March 18th.
The Kremlins and separatists have recently broken down into the region "New Russia", "New Russia" – this term reminds us of the days of the Soviet Revolution.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are "moving" as long as Ukraine's policies are implementing campaigns for parliamentarians held on 26 October, and the government's forces are attacking separate governments in the areas of civil society.
"We need to start expeditious negotiations immediately, not only on technical aspects, but also on the organization of society and on the position of the Kaakkois-Ukraine state, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateship" is linked to a broader identity, which has been discussed for months with the Kiovan leadership in its efforts to alleviate the fears of the Russian-language regions that their cultures and language rights would be threatened.
Only Ukraine's government can grant the elderly to the areas where they need their independence, Peskov says.
In this regard there can be no discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal conflict between Ukraine".
The interim opinion of the representative of the Kremlin, which was intended to correct Putin's "false interpretation", stressed that the Russian government is dealing with the separationist occupation of the former regions in different ways than in Crimea, while it is actually looking at the region where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect even the Donetskin or Luhanski regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russians and because, according to the previous opinions of the conflict, the majority of the population remained in Ukraine.
The independence of which the Russian diplomats have discussed at international forums would give Ukrainian local authorities the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give Kremlin practically in the area of power, which combines Russia's Crime.
The port of the Black Sea, which was added to Russia five months later, is located in the Russian capital, as well as in the port and historical coastal areas of the commercial sea.
In the area between Russia and Russia, there are also caves, made and metallic wastes that produce life-threatening products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, the Ukrainian President, Peter Poroshenko, proposed that Ukrainian legislators, following new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision of the regions that were excluded from Ukraine from their own economy and the status of their language.
However, his vision of his identity shows a sharp contrast to the separatist view of the army of Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin submitted his last request to the government of Kiovan to negotiate with the Russian Cypriots as equal partners after the capinals had moved further in the last week on the west coast of the Russian tank and troops in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's security authorities fear that taking control of the Russian city of Novoazovsk by the Russian side will lead to greater efforts aimed at managing the entire strategicly important coastal region to Crimea.
It has led to the massive civilian and military personnel to build Mariupol's city. Half a million people in Mariupol are known as a port city that is located between the capital of Novoazovsk and Crimea.
In Brussels, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union on Sunday, which prohibits Russia's coming massacres in Ukraine, in the former Soviet Republic, which has been self-employed for 23 years.
"We'll be able to reach a point that has not been returned," Poroshenko warned.
In Ukraine, there are now thousands of visitors to the army and tanks.
The EU summit did not make direct decisions on action; the leaders presented additional actions to enable them to be implemented if the Ukraine crisis was re-opened in an uncertain situation.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to take their place in the region of Ilovaki and the last week of the two Russian Pansary and 1,000 troops transferred to Donetsk to strengthen the separations in difficulty, General Andry Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told the suppliers in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first time he was sent to Poland in Russia, 63 troops from Ukraine were replaced by 10 Russian prisoners who were imprisoned in the Ukrainian region a week later.

Australia and Gabi Greece on the bottom of the bottom of the tunnel
Geoffrey Edelsten has reported that he has been attacked by the hackers, perhaps stolen from his arrest, and from the Hollywood A-listed Gabi Greckon.
In a recent world, there have been rumors after a group of Jennifer Lawrence's low-tongue images were published on the Internet as a result of a wide advertising advertising channel.
The hackers have said that they have a total of 60 low-ton game games about Lawrence as well as other superstars, such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele, as well as samplers from Kirsten Dunst.
The pictures of the Australian exhibitors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne are also apparently stolen during the iCloud year.
The list contains 101 public names.
In the last month of Greece, Mr. Predels said to the Confidential chapter, "This is amazing."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It's embarrassing that personal data can be stolen and disseminated.
In New York, Greece reported a comment on a "disgusting" Web site and said that the victims "know themselves to be humiliated".
The hacker believes 30 pictures of Palmer with this former boyfriend Scott Speedman, a group of two purchases of Palmer in the upper floors are taken from the street.
Palmer's film animations include the film "Love and Honor" by the competitor Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's attention to Strahovski and Sugar Punch samples Browning did not comment on hacking images yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence told the TMZ chapter that "the issue is a serious breach of personality".
The sampler Seth Rogen hated hackers, saying: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product."
The publication of the stolen images should not be made possible only from a legal point of view.
