Turnout of the right of populist in Austria, together they form 29%
The early elections to the Austrian Parliament have led to close results, a significant weakening of both parties of the present great coalition and an express strengthening of the right party.
Some of the forces and specialities have suffered from the Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the current president, Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously affected.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), Head of Government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his trip back to national policy.
According to the results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with a 29.8 per cent vote, thus losing a 5.5 per cent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, the ODP has ended up losing 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the war and especially for the people who have convened these earlier elections.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP left coalition, the population had a significant advantage in terms of preference to SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for allowing the Government to nafragrant.
The first responses to the results were already heard speculations on the resignation of the party's president and, to date, vice-canciler, Wilhelm Mutterer.
The observers believe that this month could be reached at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both parties to the right of peoples - the liberals (FPOs) have won about 18 per cent and BZO, an eleven per cent of the votes - and that the social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same year 1999 would be repeated when the populist parties were negotiating with the peoples (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it was de-membered by BZO) for a coalition government that had come to bring a penalty by the European Union.
For this, it is clear that Haider has announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he has already taken his return to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach Parliament even though it has been slightly lost and descended from the third to the fifth place between Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the limit of four percent and therefore is not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be strengthened
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India by illegal collection of scarabs, there could be a deterioration of the Czech-India relations, according to Foreign Affairs Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was demonstrated by the Minister in New York, after the meeting today with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this wasn't solved then yes, then it would be safe to arrive at this freeze," he said after the meeting organized by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters it is difficult to measure the enforcement.
However, he indicated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was accused and punished with a fine, the government could negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter was settled.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucherera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then he could ask for the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"I urge you to appeal to the Supreme Court and then it would be possible for the guilty," said the Chief of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the matter is by obtaining a "legal competent support" to the defendant, the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining better relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, his colleague insisted that the Czech Republic consider the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really think it was a terrible mistake to arrest and condemn these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister listened to the question of whether he had received the promise that he would handle the matter.
"I've received enough promises," he just noticed.
A Czecho argues a fight in the seabed
I'm about an electronic wall map, in which it represents Australia surrounded by sea.
He does not, however, care about the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along it is also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as one continent," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean and Sea Affairs.
Your chief, Director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
They'll rule this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed is still hiding a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Petroleum and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to date take the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The foundation is bigger than the firm ground
Countries with coastal borders have begun to engage in frequent discussions in the new areas under the sea.
According to the Treaty of the United Nations, these rights were enjoyed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is fundamentally called Continental Borde which sometimes extends to a few hundred miles from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, this has exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Board.
"It is simply the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the hundreds of thousands of marines, that is, the pure economic area," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the Continental Board must be submitted with scientific documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of work.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance committee.
The Commission has submitted five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand to date.
For now, only the last three countries mentioned have gone forward," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact since it was the first that significantly expanded its maritime domain.
However, it was also made up of New Zealand - the surface of the seabed that the commission gave him last week is 1.6 million square miles, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries caused millions of pain for their study.
The gain learned from the use of the marine fund will be inestimable, as they promise.
Other states are also submitting their requests a little bit.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay Treaty.
There, where the Continental Borde begins, the region of the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The marine fund, however, is no gold mine," said Director Mikulka with a strong emphasis, adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is then divided into other countries in the Eastern Block within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as other small states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the capacity to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian and Kiribati Islands.
The area to investigate by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The fund there is an accident, it's something like a marine replication of the Tatras.
"A surface of a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be operated.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete coatings containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
It reminds us of a little patata or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to the legend came back to Golem.
The German special forces command was in the place of action during the release of the reindeer.
The Government of Egypt had asked for help from Germany - experts came to settle the crisis.
When the situation was serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the conditions of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, German special forces also participated indirectly.
Therefore, the German army specialists and GSG 9, the Federal Police Aviation Team, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, were also experts in the logistics field of the technical institution.
As the ministers reported on Monday night, German forces did not need them because the kidnappers, given a violent release, left their prisoners and fled.
The Government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support in the area.
"Blessed it did not come at that moment," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, in the south of Egypt, the Assads had kidnapped a group of 5 German, 5 Italian, a brother and his 8 Egyptian followers.
After the drought in the desert region of southern Egypt, the Queens transported them from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown until the end as well as the details of release or possible redemption payments.
While so many healthy and healthy people arrived at Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released reindeer was under the protection of Germany's embassies.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At the beginning of Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States Chamber of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first camera of the United States Congress left a very large savings package of $700 billion for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very tragically.
The United States Chamber of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the Government's package for saving financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by President George W. Bush and former political parties, the majority of the parties did not reach the programme with which the deficit should be limited in the financial markets.
With a dramatic action, the desperate defenders have still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the president of the democratic negotiations had asked Members to make a vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet been absolutely happening," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 per cent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
At the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious disturbances in international financial markets.
The approval of both the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate is necessary to allow the programme to be implemented.
Organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel reservations for the coming months increased by more than 30 per cent compared to last year - even the winter period over 30 per cent.
According to one study, despite the weakened association, the desire to travel from Germany remained the same.
As reported last Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, travel bookings for the winter season recorded a sales volume of 31 per cent more compared to the same period of the previous year.
According to the study of the GfK market research institute, reserves for the months of autumn had already risen in number.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven per cent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The results are GfK's figures that are the information analysed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and which are estimated for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak course of the dollar, in particular all travel to the United States, there is a great demand, the DRW reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost one third.
The Germans' preferred destination points are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also Germany's regions.
On all organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the increase in energy and food prices, travel costs are, in this case, "better calculated for the customer than during an individual journey".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year has again risen - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared with last year, was low.
My first October
The hits of the festivals under the sky open in the Valerie without end, the beer in a litre and the famous people dressed in traditional bazaars of designers.
A start in a campaign shop.
Actually Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's rude, the moderater on television, and she's wearing a traditional bavor to measure.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just in a campaign shop, the photographers are already in front of us and they've filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very lysonic, especially because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's what friends do.
The traditional cheap bazaar trail seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist in the Oktoberfest from northern Germany, my sense of well-being with a traditional bavor trails up to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Beach of Teresa, everything isn't so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional shoes or leather pants; no one seems to be getting into a case or feel uncomfortable - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my front receive rare views on the side of a platinum stand in the chocolate.
A municist calls my attention to my front that I had dressed in a wrong way: "The left side is lonely, the middle is the virgin, on the right side is compromised, then is alive."
Oh, God, now I'm broken behind the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care much of the subtle ways to flirt and wear shoes where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show them, without asking, your ass naked.
A young boy who behaves as an exhibitionist is called Bob, he is from England, and he is also for the first time in Octoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which is pronounced with a very long "o".
I found it after having put on the side of her beer bottle that she had just had to drink.
I put it directly on the side of the fire mouth, most people think it's an empty cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know a lot of drinking.
Others do not have much luck and cannot consume so much alcohol.
On the 8th of the night, health groups run through the party site and have to worry about poor drunks.
Healthiers appear every time in a group - suddenly there are four people who carry the blankets from one campaign shop to the other.
It works as with most visitors: They get drunk, they get drunk.
There is no one who suffers from the degrees of alcoholism and is on the streets.
"They're the ones who can't do it anymore," he answered a health officer answering my question and disappeared in the dust.
Victim of accident identified by the police
It has been identified as the 63-year-old ketone that fell in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the Essex county.
Carol Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the incident that took place in Shenfield Road on Friday morning.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the suspicion of inflexible conduct.
Since then it has been set free under a loan.
Turkey width of its diplomatic horizons
Before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers expressed the desire to enter the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosforo, perhaps only 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renacentist style.
At least this is what guides say.
The building is set to schedule the end of the platforms and takes two towers, one for each corner, similar to all a typical German alliance.
The stone's dry.
The building in your complex is a little decadent.
But once the trunk was overrun, there is no doubt about what the company's size was that this was the most western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their streets were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the regions concerned, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
the British domination and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
News was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded by destroying its elaborate roof.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then the station has been falling down and remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, entrance door to Anatolia and all the Eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Government's Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the regions concerned, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of cooperation.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to a letter and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, with the aim of visiting one of the AKP leaders, expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kinniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten hours and a half later - after a squadish trip, which produced the coincidences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, came to the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some doubts in the West and, in particular, Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built at hoc - in a development suburb, surrounded by medium-sized commercial centres and "power patents" where middle-class managers - men and women - meet at the first hour of the morning to deal with/work.
Suat Kinniklioglu could be a right-wing politician of almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It's not a case if it's not one or the other.
You have to do both things.
"But certainly at some point," I asked him, "Could Turkey be obliged to choose?"
"Turkey," he answered, "he doesn't want to interfere with that election."
He then points out that almost everyone I have talked to so far had almost quoted me: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thoughts return to the two German ladies, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would it be to know that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East, in large part, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the Ferry that will take me back through the Bosfors, I agree that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
There is no doubt, then, that the continent must reciprocate this fascinating country.
Memories: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (about 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford and Coro Philharmonic Orchestra.
As part of the city's musical project, the following year he founded his magnificent choir of young people, Proteus.
It is supposed to be for less than 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sang his final song in 1979, a few of us were finishing 20 years - we just refused to give up to the heart.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological variable form) represented the will of the heart and the ability to perform any music that is presented to him, whether Madrid or Messiah, whether or not accompanied by a complete orchestra.
The musical diversity produced by this young heart was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that continued to be absolutely constant throughout the years.
Often Tod told us to "let music speak for themselves."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in music.
That's all you have to sing!"
Its variant was always absolutely clear and precise, although never taxable, not too flowery.
Any music escape, always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been riding, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well for the two decades in which he led the Philharmonics of Guildford from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of your concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by anyone – on the contrary, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known horses of war all over the world."
We'll miss much less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his essay by William Woodruff (September 25, 1946) he said that "in 1946, economic history studies were resumed in Oxford and in 1950 he won a scholarship from Houblon-Norman... while studying for a degree, one of master and one of the doctors."
This is learned from a note by Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which he completed a doctoralsis on the British coal industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a vacation from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 in the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to pass this part of his career was unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and life" because his photographs in white and black, documentative style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and the power they transmit, always treating protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resin knows how to capture magical moments."
Second Assault for Honda Supervents
In November, Honda will start marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor has already counted with a wide habitat, this new monovolume presents an even wider inner space.
To this end, refined mechanisms are collected, which increase the driving comfort and allow more fuel storage.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz provides a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it should indicate an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanisms.
However, before examining the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
Therefore, one of the first observations is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Just in Japan, about a million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Continental Old, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007, the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009, estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a 17 per cent increase in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation, the officials of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to pay in large measure the drop of sales in Spain.
In fact, brand-holders are expected to finish the year with a total of 22,000 commercialised units, representing 4,000 less than 16 per cent in 2007.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, it has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm is also expected to achieve 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is from the Insight, a hybrid of five gates and compact size - 4,37 meters long - from which the Japanese company expects to commercialize about 200,000 units per year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of Insight’s sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Continental and Japan’s Old Age.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in society in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its corners.
Its length rises to 3,90 meters (five inches above), the width to 1,69 meters (two inches above) and the distance between the lakes up to 2,50 meters, which suggests an increase of five centimetres.
The height, in turn, did not vary and remained at 1.52 meters.
In addition to increasing dimensions, the internal habitat is also growing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a central fuel deposit, a solution also adopted in former Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the cartridge - which has a double-funded system - rises up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than that of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with engine 1.4, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear ledges or the possibility to mount the panoramic crystal - is an improvement in accessing the rear seats.
And it's that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, against the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
They're also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will account for two gas fuel propellers of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanisms incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refining and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine system.
The first 1,2 litre mechanism has a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4,900 times.
This propeller - which previously reached 78 horses - has a cost of 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation had reached 83 horses, now it is worth 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beeja car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for disaster prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that provides the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Mark Management, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the Nissan Security Council of four areas.
This robot intends to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions of the brand vehicle.
During his flight, each baby creates its own personal space in a ovarian way that seems very much to the Nissan Security Scout.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the baby, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows him to fly without interruption within his own personal space.
To recruit this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are located up to two metres in a 180-degree radio in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that, immediately, is translated into the prevention of collision.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a baby and immediately change direction by turning its wheels into a right angle or larger to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the evasion management is entirely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot move up or down or down; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in endless directions and ways like the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act according to that data.
There is no need to store information or intuitative logic of previous manoeuvres, so you can continue working with only a couple of dozen KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about gigs of memory, not even megas."
This is the first step to develop new instantaneous pollution prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan is vaccinating that will be introduced into serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses litio polymer batteries, which are easier and longer than the range of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Pre-hypotecarse pre-filled pen
It must be recognized that the US Treasury Department, in addition to being very liquid for injections, is not lacking in engineering.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent US people from embarking on empty mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a threat and infoful game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Either the 'Hotel of the Evil Credits'... or the Laws.
The theoretical aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think of one, two and three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
True, you have useful information, but few details.
It is more a page for adolescents than a place for all the public.
What happens if the game is finished?
Because there is a living room inside the hotel.
Something's something, because to buy a better house, we don't talk...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into his capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will spend nine billion dollars on acquiring 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low rate of tax.
One week after the discovery of a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MuFG was going to buy 9.9% of the ordinary shares of Morgan Stanley at a unit price of $25.25.25, or an amount of $33 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MMFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10 per cent return and a $31,25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of a unit price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
Morgan Stanley, however, lost 6.79 per cent to 23.07 dollars each to 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of banking, " explains Juan Mack, director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities, but he made it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent behaviour than before.
The modalities presented last month also show that the agreement has been amended over the past few days: Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20 per cent of its shares to Japan for almost $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "We thought that participation would have been made only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we want to minimize the risks and cover us."
Taking into account the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities a 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MMFG may be able to convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, or 47 more or less during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds contributed by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance and increase your liquidity.
One member of the group, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a solution ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan had to ease his balance since the end of August.
In the last weeks, the group had been exorbitant, who had seen their weightings down to half while the security cost against a risk of defects over their debt was lost.
This cost went back last month but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "sustainable" of Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15,000 million in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this month.
Refound the republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example, your colleagues and friends, is the third to vote for a new Constitution.
The mission was carried out as 64 per cent of the electors voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results of 80 per cent of the subfractions.
According to these results, "no" received 28 per cent, 7 per cent of the subsoils were zero and 0.7 per cent were white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the problems should be achieved at least one.
On Sunday, two polls from the electoral centres and an account from a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory to "yes", estimated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Monday night.
The " Constitution has been amply established " , it has been ensured that the Ecuadorians, headed by the Government of Guayaquil, are at 280 kilometers south-east of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Michaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full peace, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that strengthened the " new socialism " defended by the President.
The draft Constitution implies an increase in State power on the economy, while retaining the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the distribution of dividends to its issuers.
The project was carried out by Korea, elected in 2006, also granted strengthened powers to the Head of State, which could make up to two consecutive mandates for four years each and would have the possibility of dissipating the Assembly.
I have already announced that I would use this power and claim a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also reinforces the principle of freedom of health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives under the poverty threshold.
The ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end with the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 suspects have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the raptors of the eleven tourists and their eight followers captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight pursued Egyptian followers arrived in the desert ten days ago in the capital of Egypt after they were released Monday afternoon.
By morning, they had been released by the special Egyptian forces in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 15H30 on a special plane on the Al-Maza military base, adjacent to the international airport of El Cairo.
Some helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of El Cairo, to be subjected to medical tests, so they could not speak to the press.
"Good health is found" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers," said Egypt's Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On September 19, these kingdoms fell into the power of 35 unknown kidnappers as they enjoyed a Safari in all lands in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and then passed from one zur to another.
The group was composed of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one brother - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian travel agency, responsible for the Safari organization.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, transported on two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before the White.
" An exchange of shootings occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others had fled," said this responsible man who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the special Egyptian forces of the "relamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they reported support for German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by the secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"It must be recognized that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, of special forces," he said without entering into detail.
He also reduced the payment of a ransom.
The Sudanese army revealed that during a patrol an entire field on the side of which the kidnappers were found, who killed six of them, was among them the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of the Sudan (SLA-U), a statement immediately rejected by this group.
Letter - Quiet majority of culture
A discussion on cultural funding is done on manchuts and is taking over the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will be raised to declare the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that die of hunger?
What policy will be taken to remind the federal government of its monumental buildings and buildings?
Why don't we have true laws that actually preserve our heritage like Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore China's castle in the valley of Loira?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the United States and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of History societies in Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped into 211 history, heritage, archives and geology societies are concerned about searching in history, saving small amounts of private files and preserving archaeological research.
These are often the dog guards of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and officials launch their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
To what extent, a monument for history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands States - being the first in Europe - will assist with a nationalisation to the Belgian-Holand Bank fortis, which is seen in tears due to the hypothetical crisis in the North American market: the three countries will fully support this financial institution with EUR 11.2 billion and insurance insurance that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands continued to hold consultations at a higher level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competence.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that occurs in several oils over a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank can be considered as prior.
According to the decision taken on Sunday afternoon, the three States will buy approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will sell a part of its business, including in particular its activities - mainly insurance - bought last year by ABN Amró Dutch.
The actions of the Fortis started a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week, significant signs of crisis in the institution have already been seen.
However, analysts agree that with its 85 thousand employees, this Bank is too large to allow it to rest.
The company's actions only on Friday only decreased by 12 percent, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January the value of the actions has decreased by more than two thirds.
Noting the current share prices, the total value of the group's capital on the market is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives, this is not real.
The Bank's leadership has led to the decline in the actions of the Fortis to the insecurity of the North American market with regard to the adoption of the US package plan of $700 billion.
Months of action have already shown a slight increase.
Fridays appointed Filip Dierckx as the new bank manager.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had already ensured that investors had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the Bank's clients so far, they did not invade the banking offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased lease companies.
Sorrow in the galley
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when they see the data on the purchase of drugs, often refuse to sign a insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will be uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which in all cases lead to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, we "trust the galliner to the chest" - quotes Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies rely on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation of the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the client a medical check and signed with him the contract knowing the outcome of the check.
Dick had invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer's identification number, the list of medicines purchased in the last year and in the middle of the last year and the program itself concludes on the customer's diseases and health status.
For example, if you regularly take large doses of pastiles to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is virtually inaccurately high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are many versions of the programme, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company, in addition to the administration, only has something to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the programme, for example, some medicines are multidose, for example certain substances are used to treat headaches as well as heat oils and even antidepressants.
This latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process these data, which, before receiving the necessary information from the pharmaceuticals, requested the patient's approval.
The authorities are already obliged to do this, although they have not received much of the neglect so far.
Some companies have also recently drawn up the results of laboratory tests and combined them with drug consumption data to obtain more accurate information on the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to these data and at the same time it is more difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and health services.
The draft law is already before Congress providing the authority with the right to control the specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: so he developed his programme, which will require the person's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot refuse his approval, because unless insurance companies do not sign the contract with him.
So the gallons, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the iron.
Marsella Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually commercial partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in most global areas, dominated the order of the day of the ninth summit.
A French-India summit will also be held today to deal mainly with nuclear energy cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote on international issues, Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This question has not been addressed in the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marsella.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU vice president, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President and Javier Solana, the chief representative of foreign policy, received Manmohan Singh, India's first Minister with whom they reached agreement to double in five years, namely an increase of more than EUR 100 billion, their trade exchange.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an extremely ambitious objective.
This legally harmonised the twenty-eighth civil aviation bilateral agreements existing with India, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
By the end of 2009, India wanted to sign the free trade treaty with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth place between the trade partners of the Union.
The summit drew attention to global issues.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and welcomed the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also appreciated, although both parties had great responsibility for their failure.
The EU confirmed that it will focus on its energy and climate agenda, i.e., by 2020 it wants to reduce pollution emissions by at least one hundred.
India is also in agreement with this, as at the climate conference next year it should reach a global agreement and reduce by 2050 by 50 per cent the production of greenhouse gases.
They also wished to impede the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive charges of EUR 8 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian editors at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international sample of Frankfurt is expected for this edition of more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy 171,790 square metres of the sample with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition and with Turkey as a guest of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the Italian palace opening ceremony: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italian point - 264 square metres of exposed space.
A follow-up with the press in the Room Structure in Buchmesse's 5.0 note will be followed: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the status of editors in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books gradually decreases over the total Italian production, in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the wilderness of Nevada.
The sculptures have been found on an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the area of the Mammoth Lakes Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
"The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is itself about what Steve Fossett was flying the day of his disappearance" said at a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on the plane or around.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been sentenced to death in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has informed that a team of researchers who have identified the device has been sent a few hours since 3 September 2007, when Fossett disbanded Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from Nevada's confin, some of Fosset's personal remains have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes house.
It is two documents with the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash in cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of prizes.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world's circle in an aerostatic globe: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world's circle in planes and without stairs.
Among its records, it may also have flew to 15,445 meters of height, over the Andes, but with a child.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Sub out of the schemes with original design and well established with defined lines and angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk's last born among truckers all over the "compacts" field of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Based on the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and non-conventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the Glk sub, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms since the next 17 October.
The advertising campaign accompanying the start of the new car launchs an undisputed mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, which will dominate the central street of Milan's shopping until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special gloves distributed in the adventure How will it be possible to see the new wave in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format?
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car goes out of the poster.
Consequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be lit at different times in all its details, to be reflected in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes with this publication is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? Let's see.
it's clear who the Italian holiggans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports shows is held.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys from which Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Others Italia" group that has been in Italy for years and that, to this day, in fact, there have never been too many problems.
And they never met with the rival fans either.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These from Sofia have joined a small group (little units, in fact) of Campaña and Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the city of origin of the soldiers appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They're inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, the Levskis.
Figc had provided 144 Italian fans for the party: everyone already with the names, so it was easy to control.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out to Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) at that time, no one had prevented them from attending a stadium.
To four Italian fans, who had been guilty of crime in stadiums, they rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior is now waiting to read the acts taken by the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (a ban on access to sports events) which prevents not only Italian stadiums but also those in Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand any longer in a stadium.
Of course!
But now it is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We have to keep off this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they support the Ministry of the Interior.
Therefore, "good-looking eyes" especially in view of the National Party of Miracles in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
In the morning, the Observatory will meet on Tuesday, the Cams that can also be counted with a section of the Asia (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which is itself dealing with the problems in the stadiums.
"Are the hearts of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during Mameli's empire? In Bulgaria it is not a retat ...."
This is the thought (expressed in a little happy) of Domenico Mazzilli, the director of the Ministry of the Interior's Observatory (has taken the position previously taken by Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste of Public Security, where there is a core of the Utras Italian Group's supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not difficult to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I do not do sociologists – add to the Observatory's n.1 – the reactions are attributed to the countries in which the fact takes place.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take into account the future.
But we also talk about the Muslims to the Mamelimim: they are also not a retat, but if they allow them, they are not of education...."
