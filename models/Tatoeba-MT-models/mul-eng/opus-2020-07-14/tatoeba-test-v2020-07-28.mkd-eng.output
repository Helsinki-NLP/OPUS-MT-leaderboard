It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are you treated?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped taking care of himself.
Do we need to help her?
Tom promises to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go get him?
It's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm running.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the point?
He's a lover of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he's happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
Our water was in the hole.
Tom was pretending he didn't notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back.
Tom picked up the sign.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's gone already.
He probably still has it.
It looked beautiful.
We're running out of speed.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The department's been fired.
The breakfast's from seven to nine.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've been looking.
You've made a good choice.
The nudists consider the Goliath to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Volcanoes took the shit out of me.
She's been hurting me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the store?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're not right, people.
Tom was productive.
The Russians are stupid.
Are you happy, Tom?
Did you shoot with a gun so far?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a map for hell.
I don't want to surrender to the police.
You're mad at me, I can know.
Let me get you some ready.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have they done so far?
Tom's homeless.
I don't live in Boston.
They blamed the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
And tomorrow we meet?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone call.
Tom was doing what Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is big.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, and he's trying to save himself.
Tom can't change.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow morning.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom's looking around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little rusty in the pictures.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I'd really like to answer that.
I have to help him.
He's critical.
You'll know when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom kissed the mask.
I really love your older sister.
Can you take care of Tom getting home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be close to me.
I think you did it.
We're not made of monkeys, but we have a common curse.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there something specific that you want to see?
When do you usually eat?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It's been all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of gross.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop complaining, Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was eating later.
Can you help me?
Are you two natives?
He likes eggs.
Just put it on my account.
First, I'd go with a meter than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously smart.
I'll send you my account.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom's gonna be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give it all to himself?
Merri's moving the movie.
She's got a nice manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom, I wrote a report.
Are they buying like this?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you bring that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a minute.
Cut the hat.
It's very good to play.
Please, don't move.
I've seen a ghost.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I needed a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He's out.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
It's always my nose when I'm born.
We met a couple of times.
No one likes the soup.
The tree is green.
The month's duration is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Did someone else enter the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom was having a terrible affair with me in the middle.
Tom was wearing a hat that still stood the price.
Tom promises to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There must be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what he wrote in a newspaper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom's listening, and he's even starting.
Where did Tom open up?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having some fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
You don't make a man with a hat.
She and herself tried.
Run!
Is he paying for the delivery?
I want repetitious.
Why are we meeting here?
It's easy to break.
Tom's bed is empty.
There's a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You didn't see that, did you?
You're never gonna hit.
I think I'll be fine.
The comers carry malaria.
You've been holding this off for a long time, and it's got to be done tonight.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We'll get some checks.
Newspapers make a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
The Macedonian has four gleaming ways: stated, conditional, ordered and banned.
You haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her paintings as if they were.
I have three teenagers.
Tom's funny.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw shit on the ground.
I remember how I met the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a fighter now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will be the Japanese economy next year?
I just got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you don't sleep?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
He needs a bomb at this point.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our door is big.
It's a kid's game.
Tom doesn't care about you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom shot me in the ass, Mother.
I didn't have an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Does Tom think that happened?
The performance must continue.
Make a good stand scan.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go on a trip.
Why did you have to do that?
Don't draw attention.
I'm gonna be a little tired.
Pick your favorite ball.
This is Jupiter or a bull?
There's no gas.
Tom's a trawler.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a lot of alibi.
Look at the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Are we here to wait for him?
And the girl saw that.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary’s flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Should I go with you?
Tom looks rather sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things about the bones is Tom's food.
Be careful not to get stuck in the fucking bar.
Both of them were crying.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't make any noises.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the reviews included in the price?
That'd follow.
You want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they're gonna try to escape.
They're all crazy.
People start to notice Tom.
Tom knows Mary from the mayor.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to find her.
It's wrong through.
Why are you working for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in coma.
This is a good series.
Tom, the police have already asked him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still don't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him a apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
You look right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
That's why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got his room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
I'm just kidding.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I got him a sleigh.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take care of himself.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before.
Who's the loser?
That's gonna finish the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will make you happy.
The king was especially eager to keep his word, because of his heavy speech man.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
The return is too heavy.
Time forecast is ineffective.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels went crazy trying to sink the submarine.
Your doctor must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to run away.
It's getting dressed.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his fingers.
It's worth quoting a famous passport of his essay.
Tom's making Mary happy.
Tom's innocent.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by men.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll be right there.
Didn't you hear me calling?
On your way.
Don't get over it.
Just ask them to return it to you.
Take the trigger out.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom went ahead to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
So you didn't want the reward?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the stars that are holy.
I don't know how to help him.
Come on, come on.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She wants a short kiss.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Zutty, Albert, your theory is empty.
We broke up.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me?
I like school.
Call me if I need you.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son's not a son.
That's from Tom.
There's no point in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retraced!
We discussed this.
Tom got the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let them call me.
The power grid burned the ceramic plates from the bottom of the bathroom.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll come back when you have money.
The day came to us last night.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm ashamed of the war.
In the forest, the monkeys came down from the rocks.
Let's forget about now.
Because of his sudden death, he turned his back on his plans to live abroad.
You're quick to get the data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll reimburse the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I didn't bring him up.
He's got his cancer.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said it wasn't cool for him.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are broken.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They're hanging around him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The report's date is Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally killed.
I've thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a normal man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who'll help her, not you.
Most whales eat with planktons.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
My water came to my knees.
Let's make cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't hear secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm sorry you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Silvia loved the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where am I going to park?
Does he care about anyone?
How are you guilty of that?
Tom's drunk from the bottle of wine.
I fell from the point.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
Are you interrupting?
When does it begin to represent?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's shoes are broken.
Tom hired Mary to make money.
I got it with me.
Wasn't your name, old dog?
I just bought a cup of tea.
But she was lying to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I've proposed it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did she ask for money?
Hold it!
We need to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multifaceted process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You're talking too much about Boston.
It's your question, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom's running through the basement.
You didn't tell me it wasn't okay.
Senfow's really hot.
We're advertising TV products.
I was in love.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting at Mary's.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That's what happened nearly thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've seen anyone trying to do that yet.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a cookie?
Tom's at my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on my head.
Is there anyone in there?
Did you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
You're gonna have to go with her a little bit more.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom's fighting.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you were hoping for.
I just let them go.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to keep away from him.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was a peder?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was true.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom broke his hands.
There's nothing I and you wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he'd remove his nicotine bottles if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your thoughts.
Tom just offered it.
It's kind of wrong with me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Karito's right is a mixture of multiple causes.
Yes, my angels.
Tom heard everything they said.
This was a big night for me.
Tom was driving through the city with a crate without notice.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you want a campaign?
Who broke the chair?
Who'll be there?
We didn't want to turn Mary off the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She gives English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Listen to that for yourself.
Now you have, don't you?
I'm pretty excited.
I'm not working.
My old English teacher must now turn into a grave.
People often complain about being treated unfairly, but they do not think that their own conduct is strange.
He's wearing high heels to make a higher one.
Do you want a concussion?
I'm sorry, I think you got something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
Tripathies stole me for a month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a son's car.
Don't yell.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me a doll.
What does that have to do with it?
We'll finally meet you, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
I gave up the idea.
I'm sure I sound funny.
It's beautiful and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're such an asshole.
Did anyone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom decided.
Tom won't be very active.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to go to the mountains.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used indistinct expressions.
Your coffee's going to get energy!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big puzzle for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
You'll thank us, Tom.
Tom works in NASA.
Tom writes something.
Something like that happened to me too!
I'll take care of Tom writing his homework.
Dan didn't feel safe in his own house anymore.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why are you leaving so unexpectedly?
We're all experiencing her behavior as repugnant.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
What's this?
Get away from her.
His eyes shined with rage.
Why did you call?
Well, I got news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom refused to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do everything we can.
That's why you're gonna have to ask him.
He gave a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see I don't need anyone here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "I want to go."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
He just wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom's more rich than we thought.
I never meant to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have a wish like that.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the sword, and ran to the window.
I know your room.
I'm sorry.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
The hardcovers, the peppers and the leaves are insects.
I hope you'll find him.
Let's fire the fire.
I wanted to bring this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took his knee off.
Where do the pins come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of skin.
I have to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom got up, and the crowd grabbed him.
I think it's Tom.
Tom was working very hard, but it didn't work.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink drunk drunks.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I'd get a little infraction.
I recognize a guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really tricky.
Get her in.
You're making a mess with hooks.
There were no other customers.
I'm not doing what he wants to be.
Dan was a strong, caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan has five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I refused to smoke too much.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to have to sit alone.
I feel a lot better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why does Tom do this?
Tom stopped right away.
My father brought me here when I was young.
What a bubble.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I was supposed to be quiet.
I'm cursed.
Tom's been here before.
He was drying his soft clothes at the end of the fire.
He always talks with his English knowledge.
These are all the basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
None of the pigs have fallen.
She bought a centuries-old bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are beautiful.
What's going to happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four flights.
Tom's stressed out.
What happened is a rare phenomenon.
Tom packs his bags.
What's the benefit of that?
That's very useful.
Tom picked up his phone.
I decided to buy a new cup of tea.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl's slowing down.
Looks like you're an unexpected beauty story.
You'll be able to form ideas without needing facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't eat.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room's full.
I let her go.
Don't be silly.
I can't open the bottle.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't listen.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the main idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
It doesn't stop me waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for it.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned up his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom's on the ice.
I'll never capitalize.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first butterfly I've ever seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did he let us go?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the palace is sweet.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom's having a good time.
Tom's not very young.
There's a phosphorous in our DNA.
Shut up!
Linda had a cat, and she suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll work as I know and I'll do it.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom was not told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom made it right.
Tom dropped the gun.
They're not cooks.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a blue dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst type of mamurculus is the emotional mammoth.
Let's get out of here.
The shepherds remove the tent to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn my back.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the couch.
You brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Are they working here?
Tom was blinded by the eyes when Mary was waiting in the room.
I'm fired.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be kind.
That doesn't look possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still don't have a solution to that mess.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's more rich than he really is.
Tom moved his fingers on his feet.
You know me better than you do.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This is not a son, it's a violet.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Jagins usually kill them one year before they're done, so people eat them.
Could you get me a gun from my leg?
I forgot how much you know to be smart.
Can I see her?
He's spending his money getting water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't think so.
I'm not quite sure.
Let's end this.
I've already told you millions of times you shouldn't be overindulging.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
It's heavy.
Why should we find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's always lying to me.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very bad.
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's go through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you kidding me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels protect and guide us.
Why don't you help us, Tom?
The therapy didn't help anything.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was on his way.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is the phone.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting close.
Tom's the real hero.
Where did it come from?
Tom wanted to tell Mary about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That's what's going on.
These horses are burning.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think he was trying to convince Mary to do that.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopol since college.
Tom closed his hat.
Maybe we're family.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom holds his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not back.
Tom's really asleep.
Be smart and don't tell your friends about it!
It was written before her.
There's more out there.
Tom has always protected his children a lot.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was renovated.
He gave me six bound shirts.
I'm safe.
The bears look strange to you.
That's why I can't help you.
I have not yet found time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
Get dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I'd love to walk along the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom's bag.
The ingredients for this recipe are slightly expensive.
You're losing your power.
How could this happen?
I asked them to lock the door.
Get out of here.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a waste.
Tom Kimna.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know you're jealous?
I have a lot of money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
And sandwich?
I know what to teach.
Give them the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was washed with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
We're going to eat red from Italy this afternoon.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I didn't have three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's changing today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's a dead drunk.
I need sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unhappy.
It suits me tonight.
They traveled east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I'm not introducing that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is a source of life.
The pyramids that fell from the roof were scattered.
Who's the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean up the date.
Find out who you are.
Tom's gonna throw us out.
Tom, don't be ashamed.
I'm just completing the report.
Come on, hurry up!
You better go.
Tom cut off the exit.
I have two devices.
What did you find?
Dan and Linda admit she's a heavy drinker.
That's Tom drawing.
The game isn't finished.
Tom dropped his drink.
They stole my wallet from my bus.
Don't fight with me.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here for your benefit.
Is anyone hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to beat Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary calling.
I couldn't believe this was happening to me.
The ambis are alive.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Does Tom die of cancer?
Tom's going to swim every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
Browns create the wind.
Take a clean cup of sugar.
This isn't a joke.
It doesn't matter.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father didn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't be able to help them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you see?
That would be a disaster.
I like the French writing their word "bubamara."
The needle can run twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
Do you care about that?
We're pretty good.
The pig is cut to pieces and crushed.
Ask your face straight.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I love you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom apparently was trying to convince Mary to take something.
I want to become and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his head off.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The Gangsters sold a lot of money from the rich.
No one's ever coming here.
Actually, it's quite boring.
You're in danger of conscience, aren't you?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
France's main city is Paris.
I wanted to tell you the first thing.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom's the one on his beard?
Tom had a bum on his hand.
Take the marble, you're wearing your nose.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were, of course, farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna fall for.
I'm upset.
Tom's hardly coming out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think he'd come back later.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camoli would have stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very nice, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy right now.
Tom was still dressed in the beaches and the bathroom when I came to Sabaylo.
We all have read that.
Go over here.
You're in the back.
The sentence is not accurate grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Is there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of the city.
You have to help her.
The reader will soon realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I'm trying.
A broken tree prevented the road.
Don't stop Tom.
There were no more beds.
Tom's got a quick car.
All my attempts have failed.
The math is his best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
Put your head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the wedding in the morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Alice.
He hurt me and called me a doll.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's busy.
Some fish know they're changing their field.
I can take it from her.
Bring some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's down.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us too busy to work.
Stop it.
He wants every wedding to be a youth and every funeral.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to drive with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom didn't surprise himself when he saw Mary with John.
Good evening.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
The favorable climate conditions are not unique to the island.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please give it to yourself.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out the pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
You know some French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Shall we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be taken?
I don't need a bed.
Put our light on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who truly are happy are not jealous of their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to get my house down.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We're dependent on work.
The box is made of steel.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust her on your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's a gold.
Try not to pay Tom any attention.
Mix all the ingredients in the garden.
He was a snake; he had a lot of sperm.
Tom's very upset.
I vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to play too.
Tom was a piano professor.
Tom was one.
Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I want to make some conversation with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know how best he is.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never been a sheriff.
I'll find something.
We ate soup from the stomach.
We can work on the open, as long as it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's treasures.
That cake is calorific.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom was a little deorientated.
It was working.
Tom's alive.
I'm hiding Tom.
We'll be able to meet you soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's wrong with her?
It's not usually a pencalo.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom was acting frustrated.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I'm a fucking car.
I'm not a model.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I've been spending most of the day here.
Are we here to wait for her?
If you go out that wide, you'll wake up.
Is everything all right?
That was funny enough.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything to Tom?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
God knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was hurt.
Where were the lanies?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't give up.
We made a joke today.
I'm dead seriously.
Give me the wine.
All the dealers are closed.
You've done white again!
Stop screwing the bitch.
Tom's done with the seeds.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We don't need to play.
We believe in the Lord.
We need to take everything we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'm better off.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with the employees?
That smells like a catapult.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always give of yourself.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom's a responsible adult face.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
I still don't believe it.
What's the shortcut?
Thank you for coming back.
Our mother.
The wounded soldier was hardly gone.
The sun's only burning.
Actually, I know the answer to that question.
Why don't you kiss me?
What prevents Tom from doing that again?
Tom often filmed movies.
I was great.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light stops from water.
Tom's promulgating the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police threw Dan into jail.
Go back to your places.
Can I touch you?
Did you miss something?
Let the man sit and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We went between the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you were gonna stop on Tom's side.
They couldn't escape.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a cavaler.
Now we're laughing at him.
We're going to school together.
You're so talented.
I need to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch tomorrow.
I hate when you fight.
I was supposed to be a teenager.
Have a good time, Tom.
It's growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This is a perfect passport.
You were swimming your bunny with blue.
I'm sorry, but my answer is no.
I'll bring it to you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is that you don't give Tom any gifts.
Tom was working.
Tom lived right up to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has a short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to learn.
Get down on the stairs.
Do I have anything to make up for?
I need to put water in the radar.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's see.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of time.
She knows the major cities.
What's under the cover?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's on all their drinking trips.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously gone crazy.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't mean to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her lyjab.
The teacher gives it.
I wasn't here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The calner was a thief.
That's not a good reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a piece of work they used to talk about.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she's coming back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we begin to take care of ourselves?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants ice cream from the van.
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
They made a conclusion that the ship came to a standstill.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did he drink tom?
I'm sick of working.
The question is who will do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They hate him.
Are you all happy?
I thought we'd stay here for a while and talk.
Forget it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's making me nervous.
It's an intelligent compromise.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me what happened.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under a doctor's curse.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a Wanderkind.
He walks to school.
He begins to lead us into thinking that we cannot ignore the natural world.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom's doing a lot of painting.
Now the question is what we should do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
End up on the fourth of 56 runners.
Don't yell.
Do you believe Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he was obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom has slowed down Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be on my way.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
You're running a wild jumper.
I've been holding them for a long time.
The vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Are you looking for them, Tom?
Here's the news!
I know my job.
Tom's not public.
Thank you for everything you did for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me there.
The animals are threatened.
Tom made a proposal.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to see her.
Don't be shy to ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These guys are very upset.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has a huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so that we wouldn't miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell behind.
We're increasing.
Please let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for revenge.
Is the house ready?
Tom's vives are upset, and they're getting even better when he drinks a couple of beer.
You have a lovely eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your turn or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If it were, it would be fixed... when the worm was born.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you?
He hurt me by calling me a witch.
Where's the fireplace from?
It's possible Tom's alone.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom loves him the same as you.
I didn't sell anything.
I thought about you yesterday.
I know where to find them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair's down.
The big question that no one has ever found the answer, including me and me, and despite 30 years of research on the woman’s soul, is, "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I'm something I'm not.
The residents are getting along.
Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to circus.
How deep is the gap?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to go?
Keep your promises.
I've been asking everywhere.
What was the object?
In each section, we taste death.
Tom was fantastic.
Is it over your head with me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was upset.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't understand how valuable that picture is.
They're all gone.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when you were born.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep me happy!
The concert ended with the people's chemistry.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not going to move.
Wait a second.
I've got something to do with it.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every niña is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think something's hiding?
I hope there's enough air here.
She married a man's zero.
The wind's cool.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to dress up anything ridiculous.
The old man died before he died.
I don't like the book.
Good luck with that.
Why would Tom want that?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
Fat Spanish.
Can someone help me?
We'll go tomorrow.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for her?
It's not over yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom took him to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, that's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's right.
Are you sure we don't have to order first?
The one who can hear the peppers how they laugh knows and what tastes they have.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need a good one.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's gonna cover up.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They've drawn a jersey to see who's going first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar's not to keep you as a stock!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be more afraid.
Have you been working as a bartender so far?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my job.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have a flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is oiled, burn it in the microwave oven.
The flow is right from us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time to go.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw it.
Tom's a little dog.
Tom's very upset.
What did they find?
How's the wool on a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's got a drink.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to stop.
Tom wants you back.
Tom's got a whiskey in the box.
Will I be replaced?
I need to find our help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales look like cats.
Dan talked to Matt and forced her to apologize to Linda.
I fully understand.
Tom's acting under pressure.
He's a brother?
"Do you like his music?" "No, you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat in that restaurant.
He's ready to turn.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would you leave?
You took over the business.
You don't want fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not so young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral mars.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate her dinner.
If he's interested in you, tell me, I'll give you his number.
Tom knew we wouldn't be able to take a lot about it.
I like this.
Put your hands up.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Does it hurt so much?
I just want to be able to maintain my family, as I am.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom hurt Mary.
He develops feelings toward her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's taking the lead in things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
He would never accept it.
It's gonna be crazy.
What are you drinking?
As it happened - so it happened.
His legs were removed.
Tom took my keys.
It's all gone.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me a place on the map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a walk.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Are you angry, Tom?
This is my latest turn.
I haven't been good for two days.
It's a red drop, it's easy to win.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I'm sure I'm surprised.
Tom doesn't know what's the difference between the stomach and the stomach.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The release of the rain doesn't come into view.
I'll tell them to leave right away.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an assailant.
The living soul was not in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you a long time ago, boys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was walking down Mary with a broken egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of breast - feeding?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't wait.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to take care of that John wrote his homework.
I can deal with her.
Can you play that card on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right now.
I don't have feelings for her.
Looks like I was expecting a little better.
I already believe.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was playing that he was surprised.
It was impossible for his boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived early from Mary.
It felt like a loan.
We want to know about them.
You're having a good time.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely saved it.
Did they work for you?
It's a plint.
Tom could see Mary sending messages.
It'll be better for you.
Tom was a little confused.
Let's do this right.
You can cross the Hawaii all year.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most think that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and rape her. It's called sexual abuse.
I decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We've broken the tire.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what's going to happen to you.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
It was a lot of noise.
I'm a patient man.
That's not happening here.
It's better to be an optimist and be more careful than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was milk.
I'm waiting to change the semaphorus.
The boy was quiet.
The ship's crew is divided into more waterless parts.
In view of what you've been cooking, I'm going to smell now.
Let's leave a subject.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
He's got false tips.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cake.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the noise?
I'm not gonna wait for them.
You don't have to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh no!"
He's not as shy as he was anymore.
Concentrate?
Don't make a scene right now.
What was he told about Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to make him help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never bad.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were guys in groups everywhere.
The suspects destroy friendship.
I want to keep you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain caused by love is a feeling of satisfaction.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a beautiful gift.
You have to go home.
Come here.
I was just doing it.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait for me to check in the manual.
Energy comes from inside.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You've lost your head.
We're in.
Get the seat back.
What's his point?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting divorced.
I can't find the equivalent.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom pick up Mary?
I don't know how that happened there.
I'm not content.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
It's less comfortable today than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's weird how people in tropical areas eat the food that's closed like a carri.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
You're not gonna do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine who wants the baby, because it shows both.
That's not good enough for me.
I need to get home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom got a terrible shock.
I'm looking at orchids in my glass.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old church in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a fake trace.
Tom was fighting.
I said maybe he'll turn around.
I need you to open my door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone sings.
Do you know how to fix the wedding?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're handy?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
She's got a sleigh on one side.
Let's do something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm looking forward to it.
She can't even read or write.
Tom hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that what Tom is doing?
We all noticed that.
You've got a lot of nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail sometime.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
It's milky acid.
We lost our food.
Is it a word about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you fighting?
I'm sorry, I don't have a request.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Count how much money we'll need next year.
I burned a cube in the dark.
How much does she do there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you in six hours?
Tom's sitting again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom's spending too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
As long as I had a fire on the white graves, I just slept in my room, waiting for me to wake up.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat's happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing on the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom hurt his head.
Come on, don't.
There's no one.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He gave it all to himself.
He's a coward.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
My mom's buying a toy.
I'm not gonna risk that.
At this house, you need to make some adjustments.
I'm excited, Tom.
Tom's running.
Tom doesn't listen.
They want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are quite different.
I'm going fishing every week.
What's the matter?
Is that necessary?
Tom's left.
I'll never miss you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The bunker's gone.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you'd better call them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, she stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Did your dog hit them?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German crowns very much.
Then we were in our 80s.
I'm working $33 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I want a broccoli, but I hate carpentry.
I'm upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's gone.
Keep it going.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They're burning you.
Tom started to complain.
I think she needs you to pick her.
Hang in there.
You're beautiful.
Tom lost himself in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Build up the holy ones, and imagine your will.
Come on, open it.
Tom took a serious look at Mary.
Tom was wearing a dozen.
Tom looks decisive.
I'm glad she didn't call.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan was pretending he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready?
How long has it been?
Don't burn.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good job.
Mary didn't eat the fruit.
Tom's a joke.
We've been much worse.
Tom helped him stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to hate me.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I only drank one cup.
No one's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
I'm just looking for that.
There's so much to do.
You're a poet.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with a complete mouth.
They're all out of control.
Every customer has his rights.
I'm just calling you how much I can hear you.
Are you in bad shape?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What'd you do last?
We won.
Tom says he never got sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is a pain.
These are the only rules you should remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you a friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This may hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's looking at us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't sing at parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not very upset.
It was about midnight.
That's scandalous.
What's going to happen if you turn around?
Did you change the champagne?
Tom was looking around, he was expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's hot here.
I don't think they followed me.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
Actually, the climb was very interesting since I was expecting.

I'm sorry, but I blew up some coffee on the mussel.
He just went there.
Tom's healthy.

Tom would like that.
She's running outside for a long time.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom to Mary was sitting.
Tom mustn't let him leave.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that what I'm saying?
Tom's a vortex.
I'll have to try to deal with this alone.
They sent the universal ship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure you know this isn't diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
You dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle a long time ago.
The time in April is endless.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
It's hot for me.
Tom was a boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm unchanged.
Give him a second chance.
I broke the sandwich.
Can we see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two kids.
In short, you're guilty.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom hated Mary.
Tom broke up in the wedding.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my lucky one.
Accept Tom's advice.
Tom left unsatisfying food on the floor.
Tom's changing the line.
There's no living man in the classroom.
The rocket's flying.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little involved.
Tom just came to visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I want you to be happy.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was confused.
Tom tried to seem busy, not asking Mary to help him.
I eat meat very rarely.
I'll go ask her.
I hear his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
Flowers are coming fast after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm bringing rice back.
I can do it for them.
Tom's not writing well.
I ate late last night.
I just don't like it.
Besides, I can fly.
We're wasting our money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here, let's go.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may be laughing at others, but I've never been able to be anything but what I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine if Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't hurt me.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you imagine your wish?
Children sometimes fear the darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's lying.
The cube hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
I like him here.
He went through the street.
As long as he's alive, he's got hope.
I heard them disappear.
Too bad I didn't drive right here.
I need to visit Tom.
What's wrong with you?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what he said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Let me be damned!
First I'd walk alone.
How much did he buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son is dying of surprise.
Nothing can stop us.
It's not available.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to sleep with you.
I didn't see where you put your keys from the car.
Are you sure you don't want to look at another option?
He didn't give them a chance.
He just showed up.
I'll do as you order.
That's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's leaving with a sex car.
Appreciate your thoughts.
You're not going.
You know that?
You've done a bad job.
Tom's hungry.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too much.
Who was the thief?
He's got a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the pictures doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this would be a big deal.
I didn't know if I was angry or laughing.
I'm mad at you.
We were waiting.
Tom's been in seven hours.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're absolutely safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, Will you come to visit us next month?
The Marinets control them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls got her because of her clothes.
You'll be confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he should have done.
I'll give them another chance.
It's just that he called me.
The failure has healed him.
How are you today, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of shooting.
She doesn't even understand me.
The breeders believe genetically modified plants damage their health.
Now you can go.
They're taking a long time.
Tom's second year.
If I can understand, then everyone can.
The tourists weren't happy.
Tom's got the shoes in his room.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom's puppies.
Laws are like spiders - hunt muscles, but they let the bones and the feared break down.
You're too proud of the pool.
When did Tom go to Boston?
You left the key on the desk, just like he used to.
He pulled his red jacket down, jumped up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't look at the same subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something happened to Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are welcome, but we're silent.
We were looking for you.
You're my family.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the garden.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long have you been, Tom?
He's sending messages to his boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom's acting desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom's unforgettable.
Kito is a very beautiful city.
The arm doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's so weird.
I'm writing my note.
"Why did you break my burden?" "Dear dear."
We were very close.
I wake up every day.
Give me your knife.
No one's defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
He's not waiting for a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Wait for me to wake up.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's an accident.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can kiss me, beat me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never hide my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
Camoli could be as happy as you are.
Try the jamper.
The cat broke his legs in my hand.
"When did you sleep yesterday?" "In four hours." "What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with the former."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little upset with someone else.
His heart was broken by unselfish love.
When is it too much?
What does a man look like in a woman like me?
You're distracting me.
His rank isn't high enough for that position.
Are you insane?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional chair.
Tom's not as angry as many people think.
I hit him with a box in his pocket.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going to lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill in the form.
There was no one there.
Are you speaking English?
Is there anything like that?
You're not a Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone rejected Tom.
You can't let him go.
Ken collects old money.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you're saying.
We have to face the facts.
No harm.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom's scared of me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose?
We have to pick them up in the bed.
The only reason Tom put it on the table is a beer.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to draw them.
Tom was overloaded.
We're really good.
He slept while he was driving, so he caused a traffic accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a task for you.
How do many names form?
You saved my life.
It was too much.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
He took me a bad breath from him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't be mad at us.
Tom dropped the gun.
Tom needs to cut himself.
Bring me some coffee.
You're a nice guy.
It was a subpoena trick.
The theory will be passed on to the mathematicians.
Where's this from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in prison for spying.
Can we help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are only read with a stick.
I don't see the end.
They'll come and find her.
This taste is sure.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I won't hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I'm listening to that in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss someone?
I'll do as you wish.
I'd do anything to earn money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say something you don't think of.
I liked my room.
This is just crazy!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he is.
Leave Tom to make his cup of coffee.
Our gang was approaching the small island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute, I'm ready for my wedding. I'm going to tie it up.
Tom was a miner.
It's white.
I wish I had enough power to keep my diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
He's considered guilty.
I'm gonna blow Tom up.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
It sounds so bad to me.
Get my eyes off me.
I need to get away from her.
Tom earns $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
It's a fast service.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
A boy grabbed my bag while he was walking through the corner.
When was the last time you gave the baby?
My muscles hurt a little.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm pregnant.
They're gonna give me a break, 'cause I'm late for work.
I thought it'd be nice to buy you a couple of tickets.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a fine.
Your health is very important to me.
Spirit, are you there?
There's no smoker here.
Does the freeze still work for you?
The city restored that old, historic building.
I can't ask him for that.
She's really pregnant.
Tom came back covered with a ball.
That's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what's wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom's on a base with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I was just throwing him in the trash.
It's just that we came from there.
Tom reserved a seat.
I want to use this.
What color was Tom's shoes?
Tom's giving me a cake.
I've never been a cop before.
I've always been mad at Tom.
I don't like it when they hit me.
Look at the clothes.
It was so hot that his veins were dressed.
Travel abroad doesn't come into view.
Tom's finished as a winner.
Tom's here right now.
I came to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I came home and told my wife about my work in Boston.
Tom took off and lay down.
And the opposite is true.
Tom's very tired.
Tom didn't want to come so early.
I'll explain later.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I'm kidding magic.
The girl who plays the piano is my sister.
I'm not sure anymore.
Don't lose hope.
Were you there?
She's wearing a knife.
They don't like rocks.
Tom's gone to the point.
He's back in six hours.
It has been shown that dogs ’ pain is higher than those who live on cats.
Be careful when you get down on the stairs.
Were you with someone?
I'm not monsters.
What's this made of?
Butler opened the door.
Tom was so wrong.
Get your hats off me.
Don't say that name about me.
Will I blow that?
Tom's got a good profession.
They're my stuff.
Tom went on a trip every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom's changing the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It's a very nice feeling.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this over.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We got the key.
Tom has experienced a disastrous failure.
Just get back from the rest.
Tell your son to stop coming to my daughter.
The text is a curse.
When did you get to Boston?
I'm late for something.
Peckers contain significant mineral quantities.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back to work.
I want you to find them.
Don't we have to wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people fear being confronted with a mistake rather than making a mistake.
This is no other stupid question, but who's strong, lion or tiger?
We'll have company.
We're students.
Tom pulled her out of the champagne.
She's missing a girl.
Tom hates your shame.
Don't eat live pig.
Tom made a list of the places he wanted to visit.
From his eyes, I decided to get mad.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me red and white rose.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to take a job.
She shot the tripites.
I'll be sorry if I like it.
They're playing.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in horror.
There's no word to say anymore.
You can make your job easier.
You know my curve.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom's not going to the market.
Give me a few minutes.
You can recognize children's voices without problems.
I suggest we go home.
Tom refused to talk to me.
Tom doesn't like me.
Don't you know Tom accidentally?
Tom wasn't sure if he liked his plan.
Tom's very young.
Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see it.
Tom was just joking.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid hurting him.
Did you find her already?
Tom's there alone.
You've done your job well.
Don't be a faggot.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.
Tom took her hat off.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book for me?
I'll take you home.
Did the stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not telling me.
Try to stop.
I think I love you.
I'm worried about all of you.
They walked by her.
You're a pig.
You're not trusted.
Tom can trust him.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
Don't be silly now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I'd like help with this.
I owe him a lot to Tom.
It was an amazing night.
The smells of ice cream and lavender are in love with me.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom seems to have been bored.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very old top.
Get ready.
Put him down here.
I swear, I wouldn't even touch you if I burned you and you were the last cup of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your hand clock.
You're right now.
Not all of them sleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my prayers.
Aren't you going?
You know someone who could help?
This week's extremely hot.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think this would suit Tom?
Tom's been through it.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.
Hearts of the broken mirror lay flat on the floor.
I can't ask him that.
He's eating Swedish creams.
I have to go help them.
Tom is not ashamed to tell Mrs. White the truth.
Esperanza is an agglutinative language.
The lucto leaves a strong smell.
I want to dry a little more.
The bullet looks out of there.
They're abandoned on their own.
I'm being harassed.
Tom was waiting all right.
Tom knew exactly where he was going.
I'm sorry I lied to you earlier.
I've got a few minutes off.
I'm sorry, but it's not until now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I like ice cream.
I was just breakfasting.
Step by step, he slips through the rocks.
That shouldn't happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'm gonna make chicken.
Tom put a stethoscope on the town's patient.
Shall we call him?
My sister for Christmas got more gifts than I did.
What's going on with you at work?
What's the language and it doesn't feel taste?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped calling.
Did he survive?
I'm still at work.
Tom's hot.
Where's the bathroom?
Tom seems to know everything.
She's kind of a closet.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
What are you afraid of, Tom?
Tom would resist.
What brand of champagne are you using?
It's for playing cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think I need you to finish with this.
As far as I can see, there's nothing on Tom from a medical point of view.
I saw how he plays cards with all of them.
Tom's doing a good job.
It's ashamed of you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a ring?
I thought you'd live with us.
How do I know how to get back?
I'm going to dinner with an old friend.
Foods can be closed without being angry.
Bring her home.
I'd help if I could.
Whoever wants flowers can't be a bad man.
Get your computer.
What's the key?
Tom should thank you.
I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
Camoli, I didn't marry Tom.
I know what it is.
When's Tom coming?
Could you give me the remote control?
I'm gonna get him to kick your ass out.
You're helping once.
We've been crying twice.
I'm gonna put the trophies on.
I've got a lot to say.
I was in bed.
There shouldn't be any problems.
It's hard for me to imagine that.
Where's the nearest office to fix the grid?
Where did you go with Tom?
Does anyone know Tom's phone number here?
I don't know what I have.
I haven't fixed it yet.
I don't work for him.
I can't wait to go home.
Tom killed himself on his 30th birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.
The concert's drunk has never been a piece of shit at all.
I'll hear your place.
We were all shocked.
I don't react well to threats.
Take a breath and keep it.
I love Boston so much.
I know the city's clean. The people never smoked.
I'm sure I forgot.
Tom hired Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom knows he's doing almost everything.
We arrested him.
What else could you do?
Please sign here.
I'll check if she's inside.
It's going to be wild.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He's talking a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
What's worse, that's better.
Is your head full of shame?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
It contains seeds.
You're gonna be okay with this.
I don't have enough time to do everything I need to do.
The woods are my home.
He's got a headache.
The vampires can't wait for the sand of a certain house without me being invited.
I think Tom's cursed.
I need peace and silence after the hard day of work.
If you ignore the past, you threaten the future.
The windows in my room are broken.
You hate him so much?
I want the truth.
Why don't we go pick them up?
Please, find her.
Tom doesn't bear Mary.
I'm not ready yet.
This bird doesn't know how to fly.
I'm not a truck.
Tom's studying law.
Tom wants his job.
I'm an astronomer.
I had to lie again.
What are your plans?
Tom's a real lucky guy.
We're not invited.
Paravan divided the room into two parts.
I'm planning to skip the lunch.
Something hurt her.
The door of the tomb was opened.
I showed you my room.
I was in the theater.
I decided to go with my asses.
It's been here since I came from Canada.
Fernando's faster than you, can you confirm that you understand that message?
Tom took Mary over.
I'll come with Tom.
It wouldn't be bad for you to slow down.
Take care of yourself.
Can we fix it?
You have beautiful lips.
You're in a sick condition.
Tom lives in Boston a year ago.
I saw him right now.
What's going to happen to us?
My hometown is near the ocean.
I left home at seven.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind has changed its course.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why don't you call before you come?
I can't get an absolute answer from Tom.
Camoli would have known this before.
Did he miss anything?
I didn't do that for him.
She felt pretty lonely.
I'm going to hunt for free time.
Where'd my driver go?
He's in there, man.
It's covered with black.
Tom's proud.
When did you buy that with Tom?
They told me.
He was really asleep.
I didn't doubt it.
The pins are made in the pockets.
Tom doesn't live that way.
Tom sat on the stairs and talked to a girl named Mary.
I know what you did.
I always eat.
Tom gave Mary the message from John.
Your wishes are my order.
I have a apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not a big sailor.
My father got a burning fire on the white trash months ago.
What a sad story!
Try to sleep well.
I don't think I'm gonna live a long time.
You need to help her.
They're worried about him.
Tom wasn't aware Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom played in the band, and he's very comfortable.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom examined his interest.
Let's play a ball.
It was fun last night.
Tom might help us if we ask him well.
Tom enjoys eating on restaurants.
Tom says he's used to the hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think she's a peder, and she's a woman with three children.
It was a secret, wasn't it?
I wouldn't think so.
I ate chicken medals.
My dream has come true.
This is a wooden table.
The situation is tense.
And I'm interested in Greek mythology.
The observer's got a good place.
I'm responsible for the propaganda.
We have to pick him up in bed.
Tom had respect for Mary.
Tom and Mary haven't heard from John for a long time.
You're not dressed.
They're pretty good.
Did you accept that?
Tom's a diabetic.
Call him as you like.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar to me.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They're very upset.
Why did you kick me?
I've been busy enough.
I couldn't do what you did.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard it.
You're under her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the owner.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.
I convinced Tom that he should go to Boston with Mary.
The sheep feed with grass.
Tom's gonna give up.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom refused to go to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom works efficiently.
I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take it with him.
There's no connection to happiness.
I think you know the rules.
I'm really sorry about that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back in six.
Let them go, man.
Tom's eye doesn't hurt him.
You're a good son.
I'll let you talk to Tom.
I'll call them in a little bit.
The lamp looks like it.
I have to turn off the phone.
Time's good.
This was the wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan saw him talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom with ease did it.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you make it?
There's a church in front of my house.
He's the boss of the firm.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm very busy preparing for the party.
It won't be better.
He's already done his job.
Shut my ears.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a castle.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to let go.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston two and a half years ago.
How could Tom know?
She's going to school for the deaf.
You have a habit that I don't like.
You sound very sure.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I kept so much.
I don't want to wait.
What's that, not seeing him?
The radio's off.
I rejected Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in the bank next to my office.
Do you remember what happened to Lana?
You're going with me and a point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
It's all right.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us give it all ourselves.
I'll pay.
Somme may not help us at all.
I'd like to sit down more.
Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's an estimate.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work at the same office.
It's a sin to envy.
All the kids are foreigners.
They shot me.
Tom's not going to play.
I finished twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't keep looking through the key.
Tea's nice smell.
Well, I lied.
Do you believe them?
That chair isn't very vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did someone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They were talking quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to learn to speak French.
We have to get back.
I mean that.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little bitch.
Tom believes everything that Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They've got them.
I didn't trust him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how expensive that is?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Oh, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You're under arrest.
Let's get down to the street.
The living soul wasn't in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary wasn't speaking French.
I'm not digging your bunker.
I've got a few more minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you very much.
You're a good cook.
There's no shortcut to the top, only to the failure.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was as flat as it looked.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's paid a lot.
It was sad.
Looks like you were worried about her.
Come and dance with me.
I already asked them all.
Automotive cars are now being distributed.
I can't make such a decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
He's gone to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give yourself up.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's the new money.
I told Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who gave me a drink?
The organ was an old man.
I played tennis.
I think you're helping me.
Does his aunt eat apples or bananas?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making kaygana.
I love the son's color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to accept the myth.
Don't freeze my coffee.
Tom gave it to his daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with it, it's gonna be done.
I called for hours.
It started a few years ago.
Can you teach me to play gay?
Nice to meet you.
What does that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three kids.
I'll give you my gift.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my pleasure to spend the night with a wise, spiritual, and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a bit of a thief.
The girl ran away from home and was released from parental control.
Tom's a cracker.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
It was registered in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
He said you'd write me a message tonight, but he'd put me out, obviously.
Come on.
She's getting dressed to get caught.
The river from the bottom began to fall on my face.
Mary turned away from the moral values and became a Nazi.
Let's just fight that.
I'm learning math.
The keyboards are broken.
I'd like a cup of wine.
How did you talk?
The movies are a great show.
At first, I didn't see anything.
It's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jeez.
They're kidding you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning to go.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask you to think.
They gave us the flight because of the lack of time.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices heard.
It's possible they'll be back.
I'm so scared.
The whole team is against that.
The world lights the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find.
How long will you have to scare my house?
Tom made a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport is close.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It's not that bad.
It's not going out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promises to take care of Mary.
Mary wants to drink hot coffee, and Tom milk.
I gave a false address.
I slept.
I'm not ashamed anymore.
There's a lot of chance that Jane's coming.
I'm mad.
I think so.
I think you've panicked.
The wallet I found was full of ready.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got an ass.
You'll need this.
I don't care what you think about Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's in a hurry.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna do?
The caludres sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom buying?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Wake up.
I've got a lot of problems right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help you.
Tom's got anger problems.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm pregnant.
The question is whether he can or not.
Tom threw it up.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to do this to work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were just dating girls who were lower than you.
I've got to step up my belt.
Tom would've been dating Mary for a while.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get the hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a three-year-old place.
I'm capable of skiing.
He ran out of a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping in chairs.
I'm tired.
Tortana looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's wrong with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd you get Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on in time.
The Germans have a weak attitude toward the Goliath.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't do that.
Tom won't come back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's sleeping.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
That's why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large tomb.
Women like men with arms.
Have you forgotten your wallet again?
Do you accept a kiss?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
Camoli could have been like Tom.
I heard a loud noise once.
They're both up.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a bubrege?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I haven't had luck yet.
His body was raised with coffee red.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I'm so upset about Tom.
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds weird.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure you like Tom.
I'm the one who'll help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The islanders are friendly.
Let's go with Tom first.
I've always wanted more secret figures.
Give me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anonymous.
I voted for you.
I want to eat annas for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the cupboard for?
Tom is one of the most prominent American poets.
There can't be any chance.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom wanted to never come back here again.
No one wants to cry.
He was crying for a game.
He tried to jump to the distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do that if I could.
Tom's very funny.
Try to explain it to Tom.
We're here first.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burns my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom loved Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'll be happy to help.
It's all very unformable.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're quick to learn.
We ate a lot of nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I've been hit.
No one's coming to you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't know you had that.
Look through the window.
Mary's bought a nice piece of shit.
I'm trying to get rid of the asthma.
He used to work in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom's hardly coming out.
Tom caught a malaria when he was on his way to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's taking his passport.
You deserve a medal.
They're strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's good for you to remember.
Can he do anything he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We're bringing them bad news.
We need to go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room he didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
The cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
I guess you already know the answer.
Could you take care of it?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't leave.
Who owns the boat?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom is.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do in free time?
I'm coming to save you.
I've got a stone in my chair.
Give him something to eat.
We're stuck.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope at the moment.
Her long hair was expensive coffee.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I've never been looking for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even your mother.
Don't get in my room.
Then we started.
I didn't mean to fail.
There was no need to talk.
I'm sick of my whiskey.
Tom wanted Mary to go to mail with him.
What's his point?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I have a few crowns.
I'm learning French.
Don't look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was unintended.
Mary broke off our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's visit.
We need to call Tom.
They'll cover it.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to the forest.
Let's just leave him alone.
I never wear clothes.
The greal is broken.
He's gone.
His client's making it very poor.
None of us were right.
Find the difference.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do that too.
Women like men with arms.
We spent the afternoon playing on the beach.
I care about them.
People always die.
He's perfect.
Can you do it to stop it?
Call me if there's a problem.
She's ruining her clothes.
Get your sword out.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's not happy to come.
Tom's doing a little bit of pressure on the left.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like a cup of tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom shut his mouth.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did he ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in the bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more respect.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the chromide.
We're old friends.
Tom took his hat off and gave it to himself.
That's one reason.
Give me the book, I need it again.
Marko thinks he's writing something.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very well.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a dick!
Who's making breakfast for him?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to interrupt.
Tom's been suspended.
They were laughing.
She's gonna be a teacher.
I don't mean to tell Tom that.
I'd like a marinated fish and sea fruits.
I was scared.
Tom seems disappointed.
Something's weird.
You're not so old, Tom.
Did you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think it's over us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's okay.
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
He's been working in the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll bring them.
Tom became violent.
You're not working here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's worried.
It's from work.
We'll find out.
Commendation motivates the disciples to work hard.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom shut the door off the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop spending my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure that out.
I can make a deal with you.
He's on his way.
The day they attacked him.
Tom's been measuring the waves.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's got a lot of shifts from the lanies.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom took his nose.
Tom seems a little depressed.
He's stuck.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "mamma" was used only for noblemen.
Tom's been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak in your name.
Do you believe that?
How can a man choose only one?
I came to feed Tom's fish.
Actually, I came to help you.
I don't feel it.
My uncle was there, wrapped in a bloody bed, with a bonfire wound deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safe.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She's lying.
I'm just thinking about the vote.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You missed Tom for a while.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your kid smile.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are digging something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's a lot of hate.
Tom usually wins the debate.
You can deal with this.
Did you hear what the grandpa did?
Don't interfere with work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
Put a crown on the king's head.
Tom's keeping the wind.
Tom was busy.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
It's your patent.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping.
Tom fell down.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't bother Tom.
I included the ventilator and put it in the wall.
This is a domestic jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
No examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a graveyard behind the floor.
Tom's writing very well.
That's not exactly right.
The old men are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let her cry like a dog.
I was born in Boston.
Tom had a strong headache.
As soon as he's hungry, his heart stops.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank loaned her a million dollars to the company.
I have much more to tell you.
I always write myself.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll give you everything I can to destroy it.
Play down.
My son always stops me while I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I've been drinking too much yesterday.
Tom was doing it.
Tom said it wasn't what the guy called it.
I'm gonna hang out with your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in the sport.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to hire me an interesting book?
Tom kept moving.
Just get inside.
He's pulling a sword out of his armpit.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom took his nose off.
When are we gonna see you?
I promise you I won't do anything that's gonna hurt you.
Tom's the only one.
The woman calls her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did you want to see Tom?
I'm so scared.
It's getting worse.
I don't know who it is.
I don't call them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't bear it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their goal?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did Tom get him to the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are next.
This is the base in which Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
Who college did you learn?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let my hand go.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
He did much more than I expected.
Remove your eyes.
Tom just came in.
He shot a blood right now in my eyes.
There you visit Mary yesterday.
It's too late!
There's a son missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I'm afraid the performance will be rejected; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's going.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorant.
Do you often swim, Tom?
The girl's asleep.
Go write home.
Don't force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're kidding.
Tom paid me.
It's my pleasure to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's doing crazy.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very hot.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own minds.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to prepare Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I have the impression that he's coming back all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come with a car.
I'm grateful to you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one cup of coffee less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're scared.
Where do they live anyway?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a minute.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much oxygen in the portal.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a little girl named Kuki.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he's going to hit the bitch.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please, don't add comments.
That was Tom's only mom.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
The monkeys usually join the graves.
Tom wants a tea with a cement.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I have a little temperature.
Tom threw it on the ground.
The delivery is over!
The glasses are in the cuppot.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to argue with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time to change.
You should wear a helmet while you drive the engine.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called his psychiatrist.
How can you not sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
It's impossible to do that.
Tom had no courage to try to do that again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They've been leading love.
I burned the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be non-cultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a read-in director.
By the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There's only two years in the Tropical Borders.
I think I'm pretty clear.
I'm replacing it.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this too much?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw your face on the wall?
Do you think about them?
Actually, I'm back with the ex-boyfriend.
Just finish this job.
I think Tom's great.
Tom got a little question.
What's Tom asking?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knew he was playing tennis, but he didn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say over the door?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way you hold your head remind me of Maria.
Don't stop my way.
We're looking for them now.
I've got my shoes on.
Tom would have come back.
She's always worth it.
Which country are you a citizen?
Trade in elephant hair is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I love dogs more than cats.
There's still a little room in the bedroom.
Thank you, Tom.
She's been coloring her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you were very worried about Tom.
I was home.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
He's not holding the heat.
It looks like the two of them were calm.
I'm sorry I can't let that happen.
I need you right now.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're smart, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't want to.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Keep working.
When do you shut up?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm alone, it can be said.
I can't handle this.
Looks like we're gonna have to try more.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
Here I am looking for them.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
First of all, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the account.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree leaves.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost done together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling him John.
Put my hands together.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom's never sitting long.
Go with the bags.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the physiques in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll beat you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
That's right.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have skin disease.
She was depressed.
He's playing with the fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's still some tea in the cupboard.
I'm sure I parked my car somewhere else.
Buddhism Is Religion or Philosophy?
The wind made me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluton soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at the beach.
Tom's turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I have a problem with the sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really kind.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's got some water on him.
The Esperanza belongs to no one.
She's smoking with a chicken thing.
Put it on.
I'm not sharing my real name on any website on the Internet.
They beat the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three teas.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
He's been back for a week, up-down.
It's easy to get rid of the disease.
I want a vortep.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom was really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the spy.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
It's on the roof.
Her face was torn with sperm.
Tom's fair.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around the afternoon.
Nothing's done to me tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Thank you.
Thank you for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that necessary?
You know what that looks like?
Make sure you win.
I'm so confused.
They're waiting outside.
He was angry and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand what's going on with you.
Tom's trying to be a teacher.
I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One's a life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did the Lord make me so hard?
Why do you blame them?
Get over it.
We're dealing with a child.
Tom was the boss.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's getting up.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shaika's got the rubber.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make it get you out of your trunk.
Tom's got it for math.
Tom took his money away from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to be present.
That's harder, that's better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You're throwing bread in your ovens.
You're pregnant.
Your sons are quite comfortable.
I know how valuable that is.
Call me if you find her.
We ate the same and the tree.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've broken the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days ago.
You think it's weird just because it's not white.
She decided not to pay for the globe.
I admire them.
My car's back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them a apple.
I can't argue that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any benefit from that.
It's not okay yet.
Cite an example to me.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was it true?
The Philippines was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They're not leaving.
It's close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire lived in the dead cave.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've finished my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate surgery.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be delivered?
Tom's got a mother's eye.
Tom's company is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're mad.
By the time I left, Tom was still on the beach.
If I cook with hot water, the mirror is closed in the bathroom.
Tom took a picture.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can laugh at me.
I'm sorry I don't have enough money for me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, you?"
A mouse hits the knee.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
I've been reimbursed.
I'll never get there again.
I'm filming.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got a job to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in a horoscope?
I know I'm going.
I'm bringing it.
It was a real disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I've been thinking about everything.
I'd like to know why my name was removed from the list.
Tom fixed all this up.
I'm not gonna betray her.
Flowers attract dogs.
The water is milk.
In the past, there was no productive life in this subterfuge.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I tell you.
Who'll trust you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth trying.
I've done the right thing.
Tom's too far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old hat is broken.
Let's ask them something else.
Why doesn't Tom have his name on the list?
Yeah, huh?
I'm very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not taught that.
She's got tights.
I don't like it.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet are traveling together.
There's no time to explain.
Will they arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to leave.
We tried to make them tell us.
Come on, beer.
He's waiting for you, Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are people from opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom wasn't playing fair.
The wound was getting worse.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold on.
Tom covered his head with a pen.
Tom must feel lonely.
What's on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom sent Mary's papers to the bureau.
Tom did this.
I'm learning the history of art.
I don't agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
It looks like these two are in touch again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It is a moral choice for the translator whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he has produced.
You're hungry.
Tom's avoiding Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for his permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Will you eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Look at that.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It's been a while.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom got to the lottery.
He inspired me to teach Tom.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun is constantly changing.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked at Mary deeply in his eyes and laughed.
It was very boring in that room because all the windows were closed.
Tom could hurt himself.
It's all right.
The stars shine.
Really?
I can touch the floor with the clothes without pulling the knee.
Tom's a legend.
Tom could do better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
To find them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know.
Tom was brutally killed on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of nice of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can eat lunch in the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Let's go.
We're going to market.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a winner.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why do you have to go, Tom?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone's been following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a right medicine.
We went to the beach.
I don't want you to bother them.
Depends on your decision.
That's ridiculous.
Tom's acting bad.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
Tom was taking care of you.
It's not nice.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut.
Aren't you a banker?
She was deeply satisfied with what she had learned from her lawyer.
That's our best chance.
I smelled flowers.
Tom's in a hurry.
I asked them to come back.
I trust the teacher.
Tom's gravel fire extinguisher and he started shooting.
It's for tennis.
I wasn't in Boston the night they killed Tom.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Who are these?
Speak in your name.
He's been having a lot of trouble.
That slowly develops hatred for me.
I don't think they're the framework for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we didn't agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are unreasonable to me.
Tom doesn't seem decisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold on.
I'll never forget it.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
I've got my computer down.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
Forget your wound!
That is how our conscience really works.
You don't have to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom took the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's nice to see you.
Now you can go, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
My English became my favorite object.
Things happened fast.
What evidence?
When we woke up, we faced a horrible news report.
The wound of the knee now, gentlemen.
Remove your eyes.
Mary's scared.
It's not your job!
Tom wouldn't do anything.
Tom's a farmer.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when did Tom sleep?
Our job is to help them.
He's suffering great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mental bomb?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'll have to spend the night here.
I'd cut myself a little bit.
This is where I'm going.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
He's got blood on his brain now.
How many backup keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't a man that was easy to agree with.
I don't want a pig.
She wants to run.
I need a sailor.
This was a crime of thought.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids drew pictures of the credential trottore.
You're wondering what you've kept so much.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom has been married for 26 years.
We've already cleaned that up.
Do you want me to get you out of the airport?
He's playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking friends.
I didn't see the spirit.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to act as he thinks is right.
Tom's obviously not always aware of what's going on.
Come to see us in the near future.
Did you smoke today?
What's the word?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to thank you for the magnificent paintings she has in her house.
I'm not local.
What do you have in mind?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite noxie?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
Good rain.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
Actually, it's very often.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Didn't I do anything to upset Tom?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom is counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Merri's taking off the carmine.
Come on.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let this stay between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be dangerous.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your month is coming back.
Tom wears John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up when they break up.
Mr. Gorbachov, break the wall!
Tom seems to be in danger.
Tom's gone.
That's the way it should be.
Let's try to agree.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't like it in my pension.
Thank you for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll check it out right now.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom didn't hurt you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a shal is a girl.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This marionette is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Is that my eyes?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so much in love.
I can't control her.
She's mad at me.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll get her now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll come with metro.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not his favorite at Tom's.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom's married to Mary Lannie.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see it?
I'll have to think carefully about this.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Are you writing the talks?
It was a great series.
We need to go find them.
Last time I was home on Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Put your hat down.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can trust her.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just my mom brought it to me.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed awake all night, trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's no different.
Tom's gonna sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom is well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we'd stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We need to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a cup of beer to warm my stomach.
Tom's on time.
Today's a boring television.
Oh, great!
Tom found the details with four lists.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just an accident.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We decided to say hello to them.
Didn't you smoke?
All visitors have to be tested.
Where'd you get that lousy?
You're nobody and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds like a lot of money.
It's a law!
The water has broken the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write it down.
Tom's safe here.
I can stay.
I don't see any complaints from customers.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on a club.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my brother.
Watch out for the lights flying from the fire.
It's just invented.
Tom's been talking to Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I'm dreaming you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I'm laughing.
Let's pick up a soul.
I'm sure he's gonna put the next test.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He was so scared to kiss her in his mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three candies for the bugs.
It was nice.
You owe me nothing.
Tom's turned into a wolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Children love cake.
He was pretty pregnant.
I can go out with Tom.
Tom's getting nervous.
This is from us.
In another case, what number do I call?
I still love horses.
I didn't touch him.
Who's right here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary brought Tom all the money.
That's a lot of nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to smoke.
Peppers are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe that won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to send 18 tons of oil.
Tom was out of work before.
We have everything.
I've eaten his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You've been right since.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "chao"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They ignore me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fake.
Beauty cannot be defined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's incapacitated.
The girl let him go.
It's perfect between me and Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
Leave me alone.
Tom screaming wakes up at night.
Tom has a weak species.
The mirror wasn't working, so he couldn't paint it in the dark.
We agreed to start immediately.
Is it done?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is it hot coffee?
Tom cut his eyes off.
The farm wasn't lucky to be a peacemaker.
Open up.
Put your gun down.
Maybe you're wrong.
Watery spasm and cake.
Tom has a plan.
Why is Tom still at school?
I was honored.
I talked to my advisers about what I was going to take.
I've already written everything she was supposed to write.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston's worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom right now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's check.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll tell you what you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in this room?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it on his own.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I've never changed the sleep schedule.
Well, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the club.
People, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll move you.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
She's got something on Tom's ear.
Tom knows he's very kind.
I've seen how it works.
Tom's gonna thank us so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very sweet.
I thought I'd remember.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask me to Google?
The emotions are contagious.
I was just smoking.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's with him again.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're the manoeuvres.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom gave you.
I need to pack up.
That responsibility is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I've been through today.
My pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I don't see anything.
He's a very uncomfortable man!
They broke down the beach floor.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I need to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom's acting jealous.
Tom took the picture out of the wall and threw another one at that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's moving fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
You're not drinking in any way.
That was a very unsolicited by Tom.
It's a doppelganger.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm upset.
Let them get rid of you.
Secrecy's a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehabilitation.
They'll pay well.
Tom probably got out.
We didn't fight.
Tom's in there.
At the same time, you are hard and easy, and nice and hot; I can't even live with you without you.
Let's say now that you're right.
It's Tom's great to go.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one's worried about that.
I'll see you later.
It's hot here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I just got it.
Tom's free of charge.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
Thank you very much.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They're all alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm taking an account.
Tom hit Mary on her head with that.
Tom's gonna kill you.
You and me better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a living room.
I need a musical instrument.
The report is written very fashionable.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't cry.
I wrote a book, and that's great.
Tom's turning the kitchen.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, we had a lot more trouble.
I'm being watched by ghosts.
I was tired and studying.
Nothing is sad about stupidity and diversity.
They're all taped.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What's the Web site crash?
The vampires live forever.
They're both laughing.
What do you have in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sensitive.
I hate Patlichans.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
He's getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want us to run?
I need Tom.
The changes are never easy.
Is Boston far?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it until 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy like you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston with a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please, don't vote for her.
I'll play with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it in the train as he went to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled his foot out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard's coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck on the needle.
The Gulabites symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
The old man!
I'll do everything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anna's music is beautiful.
Is he a cab driver?
I'm sure I'm losing my ear.
Now it's over.
I'm sleeping.
There is no scientific evidence that there is a link between the character and the blood group.
She sounded mad.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid overdrinking.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to insert the radio.
Games on the computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I like your website very much.
I'll catch you.
Press the button.
Tom really has the ability to fight.
What's wrong with her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
They're all wearing eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's serious.
Don't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look deorientated.
The beauty's in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beer, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I'm watching things stand.
I'm making a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move on to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
India has a lot of rivers.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't get Tom any more money.
Tom wants adventures.
They don't have a shot.
A lot of trees fell.
The lions don't distinguish colors.
That wasn't right.
The answer is crazy.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're far away from home.
Friends spend longer than they remember.
Look at this.
I want you to get my money back right away.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm going through very nice here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you married Tom.
Tom's doing pretty good.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do the cows survive?
I've got a nose on my right ear.
The boxes of cardboard are broken.
My stomach hurts after lunch.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he's not speaking French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to learn.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promises he'll stay in his room.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
We're not gonna break the curse.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't do that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text doing?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for the help she received.
I decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
wishs live long.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom's really sleepy.
Do you help him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I'm on it.
Did you get here with the car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're a friend.
I'm tired of something.
I know you don't speak French.
- Did he call?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for having me.
Susan's actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from underpants.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would you help him?
Tom made his shoes light.
We lost faith in mankind.
Tom's getting shot with the manager.
I'm actually born in Boston.
And how am I guilty of that?
Why do all of us hate him?
Tom lend me some money.
Am I interrupting you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look at how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just tell me.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very useful.
Tom still can’t talk to us.
They're going to be very happy about that.
I'm a peder.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
May I have your dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to learn to swim.
I should look.
Come on, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm kidding.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's getting on his boss.
The next morning, he found a written letter in the mailbox.
Come in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to reduce my monthly expenses.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're making the problem worse.
Have you paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom set his face up.
What advantage do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
He burned me when he wore that dress.
Right away, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to his wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't.
I need to help her.
I think you're crazy already.
Dolphins are kind of cyclists.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like scientific fantasy?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm going to eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That slows down the choice.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to protect his child.
I drew the word Alice to highlight it.
Good luck.
We need to get out of here.
This is an air-conditioning test that is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let's try to get the best out of it and give up the message.
You're an old man.
I'm against the projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are written reports.
It hurts me here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just watch it.
I was just asking you.
Tom never appeared again.
My advice would be to sleep now, so to finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases are often called in the most favorable of times.
I'm a bitch who's trying to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin and were not real people at all.
The man's hungry.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is past, but beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want for a drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What was Tom thinking?
It was really nice.
Everyone's dying when then.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on the demand for exit from the pipeline.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
It's a wonderful building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats have bad luck.
Tom told me the secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love you so much!
Is this right in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a walker.
She has ears like a hero.
Give her the chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't know exactly how to answer the question.
This is a pumpkin drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like what that sounds like.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not unintelligent,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you've read my report.
Tom's coming back.
Don't come back.
The Christians are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look so good.
You've ruined Tom.
Put it down.
Tom looked like he was hungry.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally strong.
She's a living girl.
If I could stay, I'd stay.
Please stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a snake.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to leave.

I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You're always leaving the right whale.
They got here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have a professional experience?
I didn't ask you.

It looks like I was a fool I was expecting you to do something.
You're my pride and my joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
Titles should attract readers ’ attention.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than be ashamed of myself.
I'm actually working here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like how you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I saw a French film with an English translation.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Tom's back full of self-confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother tells me that the child's diseases are false.
Dan had a bad relationship with Linda.
They're all back.

He wants strange animals, for example snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't come back home when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book do you read?" "Roman."
You're burning your car.
That weapon is not a game, boy!
Half of the species are women.
They're fucking in it.
That's for them.
It's on Tom's dogs.
Where's the rope?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't pick me up.
I want to do social work to get rid of everything I've done.
Tom's tied up the tops.
Are you still afraid of a terrorist?
I don't have any cries.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom aware?
Tom's great.
This phrase can be interpreted in several ways, which I should have taken into account during the translation.

Can I?
It's not all milk and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom got involved.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
Don't be silly.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was ready to talk.
The cocoons have an old species.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston.
Tom was in a hurry.
We want new shoes.
Let's split the cab.
I don't have to follow him.

Tell me where Tom is.
Don't interrupt me.
Tell me what happened again.
Tom doesn't need a digga jeve.
She deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not going to take the garbage.
Do you think I care what you think about me?
She's been working for nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
I'm so sorry to be here.
I hate tobacco.
I'm a little sick.
Tom stopped it.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the chocolate.
Get out of the way.
I'll take my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's over.
It's unusual.
What did you steal?
Tom's never gonna finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
He wasn't right about the picture.
I'll get her.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's a substitute.

I'd buy it.
He's the one that pulls back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to respect the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's a hero.
They asked to raise their pay.
I stopped focusing on Tom.
Did you know Tom would be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten any more, I'd really like to lunch with you.
What did you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
The grain stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Put the gun down.
See you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's all about helping.
That was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's a game.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The ventilator doesn't work.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
All right?
My day was actually fulfilled.
Is this yours, Tom?

I don't wait long.
Just look at you.
This is beautiful.
Not enough empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You need to go to a dentist.

It's locked up.
Tom's a big quote.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
What do you think it's been?

I was wondering about them.
I'm asleep.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
It's like a yogurt.
You need to pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the hole.
I'd be happy to drive with Tom.
It's time again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I'm giving Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'll never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You're going to collect Tom and come back.
I don't see a contract here.
I'll give you some money I have.
Tom wants me to have his birthday party next Monday night.
Take the mask out.
It's a unique option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm kidding.
I like how you dance.
I need you a little.
We were surprised.
Tom's the right one.
Tom seems scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you hit him.
It's white.
Sit down.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow morning.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
Conductors are chasing me.
Tom didn't say anything about that.
It's probably right.
We had to go home walking through the rain.
I like it when I'm alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he doesn't have friends.
Every color has its meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I'm out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really wants portraits.
Your police are full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I've been crying.
Get me out of here.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you were coming.
I live in town.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How do I find him?
The hatred has grown.
I shed blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I'm always getting early.
You must be very relieved.
They never caught me.
I love my dad.
I'm not taught to write.
They're gone.
Tom can handle it.
Don't push me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom stole from me.
Victory is bitter.
See you in the mirror.
I don't have to cry myself.
Tom wasn't high enough to reach the top police.
Tom sent Mary to the door.
It looks very delicious.
I need to understand.
You two went up against me!
I've never carried a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep on the couch.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Look if you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you talking about anyway, boys?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumes Mary caught a fish.
It's a pleasure to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're coming out.
Did Tom ask why he was late?
It's probably not worth waiting.
I need to buy a new watch for the room.
Tell Tom to write me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't bear it.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What does the word really mean?
I'm not an expert.
My biggest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's down.
Tom gave a word.
Tom and Mary left us the first day.
Let's talk.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom just did this.
"Aren't you going to eat the bedroom?" "I'll eat it after."
This is my favorite object.
Tom's signal of the whale.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are from real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears her hair on the string.
They burned him.
You've finally left.
Tom gave up on Mary.
I'll go find them.
Tom came back, though he was coming back.
I don't want to use dilda-- I'm guessing real dogs.
I'm not going to cook it.
Why do you call her?
You really need a psychiatrist.
Tom kept talking.
He's playing on Sunday.
Tom's surrounded him.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what's going to happen next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Have I not told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect your help.
Tom, I'm gonna go.
Tom was only five at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your findings are clear.
Tom was talking too much.

The fence built a temporary bomb.
Tom's actually laughing.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They've been contacted by mixed politicians.
Tom takes notes.
They gave me a map.
We're going to have a discussion about the future.
Everyone has their style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I have a apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad's giving me 10 bucks a week.
I hear you don't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long has he been working for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom cleaned me up.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you drink wine, it's good to get rid of it with milk, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to help us move the keyboard.
Tom used to be shy.
It's gone.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want jobs?
You've lost your mind.
He really burned me.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often tortured at school.
When does it start?
The sword is about itself.
Tom passed through the field.
I put you three cupcakes in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The arm's got a hole at the palace.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's how I doubted.
Tom doesn't do what he needs to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither a friend nor a ghost, it's just unique.
We did everything we could for her.
You need to buy some sugar.
What are you doing for dinner?
What did you do then?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started speaking, the voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked at the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary laugh.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'm going to switch first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
It was just a few days before she was nine and a half years old.
Is he asking everywhere?
It's important to have hope that no one's ever a hundred percent.
He's a gesticulating while he's talking.
Sit down with me.
Tom's excited.
Tom never gives anyone money for a loan.
I'm really happy for Tom.

Please don't ask me about them.
Tom searched for the tree.
The earth is still in motion.
He was taking me to bed.
What a collection!
Everyone has names.
Did you ever smoke a chicken?
The dog followed me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
We're trying to make it a joke.
I'm breaking my plastic bottle.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're finished.
I threw my money into the water.
I think that's crazy.
Tom's very upset.
It's expected that the oblique will fall into the lake.
I can deliver a message to her.
She's a little red.
Tom's a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom was standing and quiet.
I'm collecting mail marks.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Are you living here?
It looks like a cat.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Fasher's business.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and let him find him.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The quests are welcome.
That doesn't matter.
I want stripes.
You've got a really good manuscript.
The wind continues to blow.
Meanwhile, the stupid uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
The mishuns are falling from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You can wait here for free.
I got five in French.
I want the class to shut up.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him.
The wind blows.
It's a risk plan.
How quickly does it come from here to mail?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom was laughing at each other.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Will you mask yourself this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there's an unforgivable act, it's the thing to refuse to forgive.
The door's shut.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he was gone?
Tom gave it to Mary.
I'm hungry for him.
He's at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed Mary watching him.
You're strong enough.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice man.
The eagle is the king of the birds.
I'll call you later.
This is an evaluation.
Why don't you rest?
You have no question why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
Heaven's been discovered.
The gala will wake the baby.
Just look right.
That's not something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing remi.
I decided.
Take care of our planet.
Tom's on Mary's side.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think he'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
It's the book.
Don't take my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm going to do it.
Tom read Mary's secret log.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked till two hours.
I learned about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
He's been calling his appetite since the long walk.
I have to go help her.
Tom served with a cup of tea and a crown.
Tom could tell you.
I'm just not gonna make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it is, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laugh again.
The wedding must be perfect for me.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Are you out there?
You should get up early.
Tom noticed the danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's full.
Tom's the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one was gonna care about him.
Did you write a diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I left prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to jump through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't hold it.
I've known the hunter for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you hiding?
Come on, Tom.
I'm gonna try and get to time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking contaminated water can cause disease.
Up and down we're ready.
Tom has an old ear.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
I'm not his friend.
Tom stole your money.
Don't touch the foot.
I helped him break the table.
I've been eating a snitch with a bunch of cuffs last night.
It's better for your health to go to the stairs.
Tom bought the coat.
We gave them a seat.
Your faith is precious.
I'm sorry I told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Get me in two and a half.
Tom's gone.
I slept in the couch.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Isn't it nice for you to have short arms?
Tom's the best.
There's an art eye.
That was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need a cover.
Tom's a little late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know some Asian Japanese films?
Did you catch them?
The French language was the first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We'll give them cake.
The fingerprints of the knife confirm her fault.
Can I wait here?
We can look in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe he didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
You've had breakfast.
That could be done.
I'm being chased by Italian police.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule he sent me to you.
It's not expensive.
It's the real damage.
Having too many books to read is a good job.
We'd have fun going to the party.
Don't save your voice.
He's slammed my head.
You must be careful.
Tom's acting under arrest.
You're having fun. You're still young.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent these to me.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How do you not know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Messa's not a nice smell.
Demek need me to know you?
Tom just covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't care.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture is made up of a mixture of various green oil.
They live in poverty.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just turned Tom's room off last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead box, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell that dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
It turns out there's no Dan air.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a clumsy.
We're ignoring her.
He's here before them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent it on the table to the new muscle that was just bought it.
Tom will help Mary.
She grew up in a orphanage.
Tom's hot.
The holiday is overdue.
It's locked.
I found your shoes under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'm going to try to get confused.
Esenta's here.
Tom wanted to pack up.
Tom bought a bad hat.
Did you cause the traffic?
The water needs only three minutes to shut down.
They could have let me go for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so great.
Dan was about Linda for a long time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to sign up for a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed with the mind and conscience, and they must treat one another in the spirit of general humanity.
What agreed was an accident.
This building is huge.
They were kissin'.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do it on his own.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Did you see how it works?
The soup's too heavy.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom keeps practicing.
Try to understand.
There's nothing you can do to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom Zirna in the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
I seem familiar.
I hope so.
I offered to throw his ass out, but he answered me that he wasn't.
There's someone in the tunnel.
There's all their limits.
With all that heat, I couldn't sleep last night.
The bossilo, the jellyfish, the rosmarin, the team and the orchid are popular bees.
We're hate.
You're an intelligent man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the club.
I don't know. I don't know.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door is open.
That doesn't sound enough.
I'll go to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared our room.
I knew he couldn't trust Tom.
I know I can hear the secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of embarrassed even.
I'm practicing.
She may have been lying to you, but she doesn't have me!
Come on, let's just grab the mask.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick.
Tom put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some money.
The room was a bathroom.
It's just to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that had stuck to his brain.
It's fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If possible, this weekend.
I know what it sounds like to you.
One of the suitcases is quite empty.
I'm so sorry, but I've seen you lose your sunglasses.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect's confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how painful it is to kiss you.
We're bringing the lives of the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vagina.
I need paper, prayer, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it to you.
Tom doesn't have it because he's sick.
The cats have the ability to watch in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
Breakers don't help against hate.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the day?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
It doesn't seem like we're going to ask Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow Saturday morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Is it caloric?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom took Mary for the rehearsal.
I broke my nose today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I'm not late.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make his sins.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You should grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can your name and phone number?
Tom was chasing me with a stone.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so hot, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid rain.
I'm getting caught up for a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't get it.
Tom was under arrest.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
Some of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all doubled.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "Russians are coming! Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I'm enjoying a long walk on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in his pocket.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The deaf are moving to the woods.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's getting out of here.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write so well.
The king didn't predict the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I'd like to cut bones.
What did Tom do here?
He slept while he was driving, so he caused a traffic accident.
We were shocked.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a hug.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
Snow fell last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I'm pretty good speaking French.
Be careful not to go too far.
Tom's a librarian.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with something?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
We'll need about three hours to get out of the mountain.
I'm just starving.
They're disqualifying me.
Did you finish packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's getting better.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get involved.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm driven to trust you.
You're too busy for him.
The president said the US will launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you a book.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
I want to be a breakfast.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I here early?
It sounds very strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this where this is?
Do you want to stop?
Take care of yourself, Tom.
Tom's tied up his knees.
I can't put it out.
We shouldn't have stayed awake till 2:30.
It really does.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called a fire.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom decided somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarmman's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there a warrant?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they picked him up.
That's an unspoken fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We need to give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a human being.
Tom's a little upset.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom handed her over to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Medellin.
Did you stop pushing your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why don't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring him.
Survivors are looking like bitches.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm preparing a soup in a big tanker.
If I meet Jesus, I'll ask him the stomachs.
We can't do anything for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the volleyball?
You've removed your dark hair with a walker.
If an adult lies a child, he thinks he's always right.
Nice, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I won't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of that.
Tom's got the scarfs out of the toolbox.
Pick up the jacket.
I hope you'll enjoy the river.
Dan stole the walls from his room with racist symbols.
Tom was lying with his hands.
Open the theaters.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the wallet.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do everything.
Tom came to the next question.
That was reasonable.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't want cash.
The book will help you write something.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
He told you we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, get the room out of here.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates ridiculed her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary on the left.
I've found my balls with honey.
They've tasted the leaf.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of countries.
The area is very isolated.
I'm guessing the pope's escaped from the coffee shop.
We went to pick eggs.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunglasses.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's excited.
I wouldn't have come for a while.
I made cake.
Look at the number.
You inspired me your design.
You told me to call whenever.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom's done it.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hello, how are you?
Last month, I had a severe infection.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to dry up a kilogram.
That's what happened before.
I have my theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
How do we benefit from that?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "All right, thank you!"
Mary was a wonderful novelty.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish word is a fast-paced.
The bridge's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't make a mistake.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary may agree.
Why did he leave me?
I don't want to fly.
Everyone has to stay.
We were quite confused.
You're not a Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom doesn't care about sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I wasn't sorry about them.
Tom feels he needs to go out.
It's a message for them.
When am I gonna get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom took his knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The firm left five people.
I should apologize.
Tom was here.
We don't get along.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He's lying to the dog with a stone.
Tom was furious.
It's already seven hours.
I'm in love.
We can try.
Demek, I wrote a book!
Don't put so much beer in the soup.
Let's not be in love.
Look around.
Tom looked through the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need you to help Tom.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the garden garden, you have to test it.
Tom's not good today.
We don't see.
Mahmud doesn't deserve to die.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, believe me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgottenness and hate usually go in pairs.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants were removed.
I asked them what's wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had a wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom admits he blew up the red wine.
Do you want a dog?
I live close to the defense.
You're all scared.
It's not wrong.
Integrity is good.
You'll respect human rights.
They broke the rules.
Did you hear about us?
We visited Laura's funeral.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'd be glad to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as much as your soul wants.
Just catch me for a hand.
I shouldn't have believed her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very late in his job.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
Not on your own.
I remember you were in Boston for a while.
How much stomach should I do every day?
Will you cry?
Tom's trying to get away.
Tom's kind.
What was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel around the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
The day turned into a questioner.
You've got a lot of broken eyes.
Doesn't that make sense?
I felt tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We need to let Tom get back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Will you come back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's go inside.
Don't let them go.
You need a friend.
Tom's making a lot of money.
Tom's acting confident.
Do you want to drink water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the number is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
It's developing dependence.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Bring the thief.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary got to her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to take something from the supermarket?
Finish the mission.
Tom deleted the knife from the farmer's knife.
Tom was trying to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them turned to me.
I can make that happen.
Are you bleeding the needles?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his cup of beer on the couch.
The Devil is a believer.
I didn't say I'm speaking French.
Let's get a good look at it.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from cloned animals.
How far did you go?
My father is very hard.
Maybe I better get back later.
What do the tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Are you going to get drunk?
Give him a dollar.
Did he have an autopsies?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that might be possible.
He looked sharp through my eyes.
Linda convinced Dan that he's demonized her.
Why would that happen to them?
Let's not interrupt Tom.
It's tough. It's tough.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave pretty much.
I need to get out of here.
Why is heaven a son?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who could break the aquarium?
He came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has been battling depression in more periods of his life.
You want me to take your time?
I'd believe that in my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What are you going to worry about?
I need a nose.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who taught him French.
The class will wake up.
There were penguins on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a sleazeper.
I want to cut my hair.
I respect your decision.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not excited.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a castle near Boston.
I hope you like the new boss.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was hungry.
She's studying English.
With such an angry dream, he will become or read a writer or a crazy man.
We both hate her.
They're starting to burn it.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We'll visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end the poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom's got the gums to suck.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving me birth.
Who's recommending that?
How did you get that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally won it.
How easy it is for bad habits to develop!
She's beginning to act weird.
Probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she had developed an interest in archeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What should we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always misunderstand me.
We're strong with you.
The president seemed strong.
What do I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm pregnant.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do as he wanted.
I thought you'd better play chess than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary's a Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to make them come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Put out the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are afraid enough, things can happen.
You're a tough city.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's got his door locked.
Pick up the day.
What's the sound, Tom?
He's very comfortable.
Let the buyer take care of it.
Tom often runs away from hours.
Now it's time to go home.
Most girls have a reading chemistry.
You can get out of here.
Why did you just blow two balls?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care.
I wonder what's going on tonight.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was stuck, we waited for the rain for a long time.
You'll find out.
Do you have that dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing false tips.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to hang out with one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French better than he really was.
How long do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the transmission.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
I've got my shoes on.
That medicine calms the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's an American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom having fun?
Tom and Mary don't know us.
It's beginning to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fosherski's done the job.
Tom's shut down the fiote.
Tom seemed nervous.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I'm making a decision, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's good.
Tom's getting sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
We'll never know now.
Can we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just dropped it off.
I'm more like a goat cheese than a cow.
We understand that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten milk products a long time ago.
I'll see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Did you meet Tom?
Is everyone having fun?
I was all night.
I have an unsatisfied job with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know it's with you.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was awful.
Stolars cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
I just needed that.
Where are you born?
It's over.
Single couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot that she was once a body.
Give them a picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Swimming is a manual job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister filming the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you take off your cigarette?
What are they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There is still no trace of Tom’s voice.
Then I was home.
Don't bother me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The algorithm ate the dog.
Lies are born by other people.
I don't have any money anymore.
The table is plastic.
The sun's light is supposed to be the best way to disinfect.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always out of breath.
Get out of my way.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
I don't care.
Did you call a quick help?
Today after lunch, our plan is to go to the park.
You have to answer the question.
Includes red light.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready another hour ago.
Let him make you feel right now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is unwritten.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much is she wearing?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're looking for here.
Blood runs through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like a monkey.
They won't help lies.
My right leg hurts.
The apple is healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I need to buy them gifts.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a cupcake?
Tom's been paying attention.
The day had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
They built their houses from stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this now.
The meetings were held on interviews.
Tom was so happy.
I don't know English, but Camoli Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom wasn't thinking about things like that.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a hand watch.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the entire team.
What age did you start to monitor?
You're embarrassing me.
But not before the good.
The company was a banker.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very polite.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to drive.
I'm sure you'll find it.
Will you eat at home or outside?
I have three brothers.
If I eat more, I'll get worse.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't bother Tom.
That's a tough job.
You need to make him listen.
I was surprised it's so easy.
Camoli was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, darling.
They increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come to hurt people.
Tom must have known about that.
My sister and my mother are my aunt.
I've been looking for them everywhere.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't do that.
He's gone to the red.
I have to go.
He who sleeps with dogs wakes up with pain.
His aunt's in London alone.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sorry.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll be late tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom's been making a noise.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him in your name.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these advice in mind.
His answer is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where'd you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to take revenge.
Tom is my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Kuki would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom could be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very stressed.
I've been through my headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are on the planet.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give him a marker to Tom.
The time here is very unpredictable.
Is it really so beautiful?
Hey, don't be guilty.
Isn't that unusual?
I got off the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that too much?
They know what happened.
Tom dropped the shirt off his face.
Your hair smelled like spring.
The bullet was in the middle of the urine.
Tom's a big materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought maybe you'd be interested in finding out.
Give me the keys.
The Hagues love cold time.
This is a little sweet to me at the train.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me already?
Did Tom know?
Would you lie to Tom?
I'm not tired, either.
She's afraid she won't lose her money.
Tom's covered the living room.
Canada's producing a good chicken.
He loves his father very much.
Let's get up.
It's not that we're doing something.
Tom's gone well today.
Milton hasn't slept well all week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's not secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
Now this is your house.
And try some soup?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
Camoli could have lived my life doing just what I wanted.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, he did not make any accusations.
The journey is one of the seven deaths.
Tom's not responsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary ready to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
The seed went forth, and grew, and grew, and grew, and was planted in the earth, and brought forth in its branches, and its fruit brought forth, and its fruit, and brought forth, and its fruit, and its fruit, and its fruit, and all its increase;
He feels hatred for his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I'm always skiing.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn?
Tom failed.
I'm a new student.
The baby's sleeping.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a $1,000 hat.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely saved myself from being caught.
I can't get involved.
Win them.
They shut up.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be for it.
History is writing down the winners.
Tom was the only one on board when he blew up.
Who's going to pay for the zion?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing's going on here.
You lied to me.
That's for the greost.
It's not the world.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the ball.
She's here.
You were looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're breaking it.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was on three boxes.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have a fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat in restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost here.
There's an infection in the Bible.
I don't know what's going on.
The sky is red in a samurai.
I came to wish you luck.
I'd like you to come with me.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I speak bad English.
We'll deal with that.
It's made of ice cream.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this well.
Do you want a cake?
Who brought this?
I told him when I saw them, and I told him.
Maybe the day he ran off with Linda.
It was quiet in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
He's hot here in hell.
I've seen it.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
To congratulate you on your wedding.
Children, you're here to stay.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Did you leave your dog?
That's great!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have a home job.
We're going to pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't sleeping.
It won't stop me if you go.
Tom came here.
I forgot my joke.
We've been through a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often requires difficult compromises.
Tom's only got his prosthesis out.
I have to try and find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary up.
You missed him for a while.
I hate that tube.
The doctor gave her a seat.
Do you look like Tom to a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you like you.
It's funny.
It's very common.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
Camoli wouldn't have done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
It's tight.
You need to go and help him.
Do you enjoy that?
I've had a great night.
Tom was in the kitchen.
Tom, let go of the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the train.
It's nice of him to wear such gifts.
I shamed him.
They're either gonna hurt you or they're gonna throw you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long has it been?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's starting to get stuck.
Tom's up.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's blind from birth.
The book contains fifteen life stories.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
The rats and the pacifiers are new.
I haven't eaten a pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died as a girl.
Tom's buried in Boston.
Tom's not my brother.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dali's dying of a sleepless surprise with a bedbug.
His thoughts are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom's wearing just one shoe.
You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I got a lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a swear.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God.
Come on, you son of a bitch!
They fell into the water.
I guess you're busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass brain.
Tom didn't even come home last night.
I think we ate enough.
This is very difficult for them.
The witches don't cry.
Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The one who took the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom seems surprised.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can carry you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're unorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom's gonna find himself like this.
I think I've never been so scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to get back to him.
You're uncultivated.
Are you wearing something?
It just sounds boring.
Get him in.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very friendly.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I'm just practicing to look nice when I'm naked.
Thousands of years make a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
That's a nice word.
We've got three guards that work alternately.
We can't stay together.
The visitors are welcome.
Could you represent it in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your box with your tools.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little shame.
We were both busy.
I've been away for three hours.
I want crystals.
I was expecting them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
Don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not scared.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired prisoner.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
He will soon leave his parents ’ home.
Tom gave up.
The holes are barely visible.
Tom's a Jew.
I'll take you home.
My husband's a doctor.
It's a pajac trap.
Tom really didn't want to live in Boston.
The price of wisdom is greater than that of beer.
Tom's obviously upset about something.
I'll wait for you here.
I know I should sleep now.
I can make it help you.
That new song is called "Lijavè".
It's deeper than that.
Henry doesn't have more than six dollars.
We all have our price.
The answer to both questions is no.
They're amazing.
The legend says she was pregnant.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I'm used to talking in public.
He was crying out of luck.
Tom got out of jail.
It's nice working here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for them to burn green.
Do you want me to mix your raccoons?
It's stuck in my head.
I'm slowing down with my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to the end.
I'm going to get dressed.
Give me a hearing ear.
Maybe it sounded like a proposal, but the order was.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want to get my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom's still working.
Please find my headlines.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
sooner or later, it'll blow my movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, never could that happen here.
Tom was burning in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal to be mad at Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best smell I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to mouth.
You should try to write a letter of respect.
I'll sit there.
She's older than him.
I've had my cake.
Tom's very patient.
We can start.
Come alone.
You need a prayer from your pocket.
Tom asked his lawyer.
Write it on Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom always hates me.
Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom's not waiting.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The game is made from a tree.
Thank you so much.
The question is what you're gonna do.
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're not fast.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He came back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I've been asking for apples.
The heat from the horse's coat calmed down.
Mikey's your hands.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing modest clothes all the time.
Didn't you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thank anyone.
He raised his students.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
You're just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom for permission.
His joke wasn't all funny.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you saw everything you needed.
This is unfair.
They ate.
How many cupcakes a day is too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I've got my hands on.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
And you're going to make it to my place.
Now, let's keep talking in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't treat me like that!
I laughed.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy for the days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop messing around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I get a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom's working to trip more than I do.
I cried out one.
Write your birthday.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
I'll call him later.
These are as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting our time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom threw his coat into the locker.
I think Tom's a little girl.
Is the difference apparent?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom was visiting Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did he ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It'll help her sleep.
This is Nina, your grandson.
I'll change the gardens.
They've been scheduled for half an hour.
Dolcon has a lot of intense things lately, but he doesn't see any of the results.
Dan found Linda looking for the police.
I'm preparing dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not sure.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
The house is red.
We saw aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's really asleep.
Seven and a half.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She was hoping to become a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is strong from hate.
You've got a chip.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for the change.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't do that without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
He spent the last night drinking at a meat market.
I'm in.
Do you need a rent?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I believed him.
That's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to owe you.
They're coming back.
You're really nice.
I'm afraid Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is no different joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen the frequency.
I don't think they followed.
I feel free.
Just smile and keep smiling.
I didn't notice the change.
I think you'll have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape prison.
Tom has no tea.
I'm tired.
But that's no argument!
Tom got a drink.
What should I tell the kids now?
Leave Tom.
I crossed the shock.
That's a good system.
I don't remember Tom such high.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How'd you go to rest?
Then we were just a few people in the heat group.
She began to wear her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
Are you traveling too much?
Did you tell Tom about the pain in your back?
Everybody does that.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects mail marks.
I want you to find her.
The sun's water.
And there's a lot that consists of the members B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a traitor.
It's generally known that it's not your dear Tom.
I'd be happy if you three were back outside.
What's stopping you?
Tom's got thin lips.
The kids are smelling mercenaries.
Tom exercises a violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's very fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
Camoli Tom had more time for me.
I'm digging for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
You're burning your car.
She was able to learn how to drive.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the power of the will when it comes to practice.
Come to Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's red.
On your service.
I want to watch the football on TV.
Still, I'd like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need such food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to me.
Tom and Mary seem perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more I have things, the more I need to be clean.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to fight cream against the sun.
Was it hard on you?
Tom's voice was barely heard.
Don't be late.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days is it usually necessary to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to cancel.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not sure Tom's guilty of something.
It's pregnant or just fat?
Just go to sleep.
Tom's good with me.
Nobody's gonna find us.
The Saturday was chaos.
Music is only love in the search for words.
Sitting all day is bad.
Tom's waiting.
I'm starving you to get up.
The real story is a little different from what I told you.
It was your fault.
The balloon slowed down.
Who wants insects?
It's shit.
I asked him the same question.
Do three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You don't think so, do you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her hospitality doesn't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to do it anyway.
I did it.
Do you have ten years?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you happy to see me?
Merisol and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something that will remove our thoughts from our problems.
I called yesterday.
Let me focus.
She's selling marine schools.
Wardy the prisoner.
We all like you.
The child cried and cried with hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom doesn't look like his brother at all.
Tom was innocent.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a monster.
Aren't you excited?
Tom would never do that on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka to you.
You know how late it is?
Tom cut off the question on eight pieces.
Maybe you'll need it.
I have pain in the cities.
I can't take off the boat.
Give me my money back.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you you could be a professional tapanar.
You stole my new hand clock.
It doesn't look very different.
He's studying.
Tom made Mary's room at the club.
We're breaking it.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I'm happy or not.
Did you put her in?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your answer is up-down right.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still burning.
Tom and Mary left the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom is your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do that alone.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done that.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
You're married to me.
Tom's not a Junior.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and night shine.
No one's gonna get fired.
No one else.
When I was on my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl in a bus.
Tom said you're in Boston.
He pulled the knife.
I don't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom's got a knife.
My eyes were tied.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be a master.
You're so lucky.
Yeah, bring me a cup of coffee.
When will you visit us?
Every day, tragedy occurs.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those papers.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like that.
All the comments are excellent.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?
Tom broke his mouth.
It smells like cheese.
Tom's not in the wrong.
The patient's on the path of hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Goodness without gold is better than honorless gold.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems to be hurt.
We know him.
I've been there for hours.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a couple!
Did Tom become early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need kids.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's funny here.
What can we take?
I guess you found him.
Don't understand that too much.
Tom's kind of talking.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going to the point.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have fallen without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
Snow is a deep step.
She came with him to Boston.
Tom's been quite busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby hit the star.
Now I'm gonna go get Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will be done for now.
They need to talk.
That's not what happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom's listening right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There's no life without weight.
You got me wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me a jerk.
I'm very attracted to you.
What about dinner?
Open the 9th page.
Tom has his jacket cut off.
Tom was overloaded.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like wine.
He doesn't want a fish meat.
We were arguing.
Did Tom eat grass?
Put the gun down.
Here's your ass.
Don't bird or I'll blow your mouth with soap.
If I were in your place, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom represents the people behind the wheel.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not completely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
You look right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
There's a sensitivity value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
He didn't see anyone coming in, did he?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he's coming right now.
Love me a little, love me for a long time.
Tom's in the living room and he's watching short films with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his friends what had happened.
He was in a coma to his knees.
I told Tom about it, didn't I?
Tom calls Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you mind?
We need to do this again.
I think Tom's a good-looking guy.
He's a real man.
They're too big for you.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are the same, but it's good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't that exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of the interitem signs is to help the reader.
I'll be happy to do that.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why are you driving?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to track him where you put the passport.
That's really great.
Tom was wondering if Mary had woke up already.
Do you want us to take you home?
That house is built of bricks.
We didn't bring any conclusions.
Tom came in about 2:30.
Doesn't sound like they know what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a machete.
That's a bunch of puzzles.
I'm leaving details to grow on the eggs.
I think Tom's bad.
The door was locked.
I'll get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what are you looking at?
We've been down.
I was too tired to keep going.
Everything's got its sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
He's writing on his head.
Last night I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson.
Can this page be used like Twitter?
It shouldn't be too hard to complete the report until 2:30.
Tom's been doing that for a while.
Heteronormality is closely related to sexism.
She's got a newspaper.
Are you crazy?
What makes you learn English?
Has Tom gone yet?
Tom must have done something important.
Tom's still home.
The film's worth seeing.
We're growing up.
I'll talk tomorrow if I can explain everything to you.
Dan came back to London.
My father bought me a digital watch for a birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom's a human being.
Don't you feel lonely?
Is it coffee?
Don't look so much like that.
Stop when you're talking to me.
He's always been happy.
The woods were very peaceful.
I have to go back to them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's in a mood.
Most of the clothing that Europeans wear is produced outside Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to stick?
We can go online.
When I was younger, I always traveled by bus.
I couldn't determine exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom's gonna be fine.
It's so obvious that we don't need any evidence.
I bought four shoes.
You're so negative.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in the pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here?
When I'm tired, there's something going on like that.
Win her.
The stars appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I'm a lot of fun.
Where's the bluff I bought you?
That'll teach them all right.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
Camoli would have enough money to buy such a house.
Tom's in charge.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks the book is so good.
Tom worked on it.
Time passed, especially fast.
There's no way out.
The family rain at night spared the efforts to save survivors of the combined tragedy.
My wife's hiding something from me.
What can we offer our guests?
Tom's mad.
Look at the number.
There must be a key.
You've got the apple.
All the balls are running.
I have a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did someone happen?
The factory's making toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What did you sing?
I can understand.
The room has a view of the ocean.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like a bag.
There was water everywhere on the kitchen floor.
The hand is a great enemy of mankind.
It's still on sale.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It's time for my cat to pass.
Tom dropped the gun.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job one day.
You'd be a little ashamed of yourself.
I felt so old right away.
I'm nervous.
It's been a night.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge your poor father.
Tom took a cake.
I'm learning French from a three-year-old age.
In fact, men are not so different from women.
Evgenia shared with us her favorite oil to clean the face and to wash the skin.
It's over my head from French.
I don't care if there's twenty women.
Bike hurts.
Tom's walking.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't understand.
Born in 1960.
Can I have one?
The beans are usually delicious.
I'm stressed.
It's possible he's coming back today.
We were ready.
Let's travel to Boston.
Here's my member card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Get out of here.
Tom refused to go.
Do you have a little time?
I want to know what you're taking to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I eat something?
They started and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I'm not gonna bother you.
Stay here and keep it.
Aren't you gonna start cooking hair from that?
How are you gonna run?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd like to see the house you lived in before.
Don't you like your wife?
You're the only one who met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these guys from my grandmother.
I don't have a problem with drinking.
I think I might be used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's wrong.
He's in great shape.
I grabbed Tom for a lactate.
Mary wants fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I need to help them.
Is it far away?
I can't die here.
Tom's listening.
I think I'm wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She's buying a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look mindy.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The bear will wake the baby.
I'm late.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the 12th with Mary and watching TV.
Nothing's gonna stop us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Nice to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I'm usually not working on Monday.
I'm a fool to believe them.
Tom might need some help.
She went to the service every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a hole in the bar.
They beat the idea.
Tom was more and more surprised.
Who gave them so much money?
We need to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did you work the field machine?
Tom's a married man.
As Tom said, the soup's gone.
Did I miss you so much?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come out?
They stopped talking.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was wrong.
That's great.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You're gonna have to learn the next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There's algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Look!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd die before I fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just let him go.
Where is he born?
Tom got two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It'd look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like most.
Your sins have scattered the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.
It looks like her style.
I've had enough of the fight.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pens.
This is very confusing.
I'm carrying terrible news.
If it were possible, I would like to experience another kind of deep - seated love.
I saw Tom around.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom's got a movie on him.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom propose this?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with the house?
Tom doesn't know how to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We all want to see the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We stopped talking.
I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a beautiful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
You can't focus on your academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They were dependent.
I just want money.
I'm not saying shit about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't agree.
I've got everything fully cleaned up.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How hard was Tom hurt?
Was he sensitive?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's good to see you.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of what they call me a liar.
The prosecutors can't read.
Is there a sugar?
Dan and Linda finally moved to London.
She suddenly gave up.
He looked funny.
Tom played in a band.
We're living together now.
You were busy.
Excuse me, isn't it a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship's changing direction.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I don't intend to explain anything.
April them!
Tom said that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna have a job at the goose.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right.
Can I take a picture with or without a glance?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was released.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem myself.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's full now.
We don't sell alcoholic drinks and cigarettes to babies.
I'm back with the bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom's not acting like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe that was a cat.
The fight doesn't seem to be approaching the end.
Mary played the piano.
Tom's reasonable.
I forgot to tell Tom who's gonna pick him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom didn't wake up.
Did you drink something?
Let's do it now and finally.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your knee in the top fioc.
You've experienced a traffic accident, but you'll be fine.
You think you want it.
Where I can find a hospital.
Don't miss the party.
I can do that.
I don't discriminate.
I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a month.
It is recommended that you check if any negative effects are associated with the use of alcohol while you are taking the prescribed medication.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I fell.
I want to swim.
It was from her.
We can talk to Tom.
I guess it's free.
You'll need help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started riding.
Tom likes you very much.
Tom's deaf to Mary.
Now I'm putting a beer on the eggs first.
I'll find out.
The cure was working.
Tom knows how to play guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I'm sick of Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to take you somewhere I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean it!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't think I bought this.
He saved the mariner.
Tom must have been here earlier on the left.
Get up again, hater!
How long ago?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were in your place, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's keep talking outside.
It's easy to get to know Tom because he's so tall.
The doctor checked Tom to confirm there's no internal damage.
I feel like I missed you.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This protocol is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really loves us.
It's very rare.
I don't care about this.
Tom's flat bonbon.
You won't find them.
Tom's not writing to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
Everything's ready.
She's unsatisfied.
Everything is in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Forget it.
Is it done yet?
Tom's listening.
Did anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I have everything in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom and he's talking on the phone.
It was hard on us.
You're the one who's asking.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a chain.
I'd rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to lie down and rest a little.
Tom's in the hospital, and he's relieved of what he's expected.
He shot the eagle with teeth.
I can't believe we were ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
She didn't hit him but me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom get me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom never was in Boston.
I think I need to watch Tom.
Just give it all to yourself.
Tom's a face.
When you go to a meeting with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is not the right time or the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom's unbelievable.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the hat off the chair.
That's a good training.
The chair is visible.
I should have refused.
I had to take into account what might happen.
That was my tactic.
I've lived here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my own property.
I know you gave everything to yourself.
Tom wasn't supposed to write the logic on the inside of the theatre corner.
When did they move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I should be sorry about them.
I don't appreciate it.
Is there a problem?
Shut the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on the articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is so hot.
I want to live in Brazil.
Tell me what you're doing.
I'm in love with his girlfriend, Tom.
Take care of Tom.
Just talk.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met Lani in Boston.
Tom's overt birds.
No one's traveling to Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was hurrying to get the bus.
I didn't care.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was incapacitated.
I agree with the plan.
Justice is expressed by actions.
I don't know if you know or don't, but here in America, you're expected to leave your bag on the trigger.
That kind of behavior was childish by him.
I'm going with her.
That would be okay.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go as long as you can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable about Mary.
I don't need them.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the horses.
They kidnapped me.
It's gonna be a little late in Boston.
Cheov's very delicious.
We're on the same level.
Tom was surprised and somewhat confused.
Tom's too hard on himself.
She's a bubble.
The lemonade is cold.
The lamp went down forward.
Tom seems uncertain.
There's nothing else I'm looking for.
Tom's a materialist.
It's not like that.
Why should I take care of them?
I called him from the hospital.
I've opened the box.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Will you wait a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the flag on the table.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I feel that in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Maria he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you catch a boy.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see it.
I'm coming.
I was in the pool.
Don't expect everyone to have the same attitude.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna dance.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
You gave me something.
Don't you ever take a look at anything?
I've been sneezing in the man.
Take care of Tom.
They look familiar to me.
We have a job for them.
All dreams will come true to me.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is great.
There's no poison in the fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'll go to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you just sleep a little?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas anniversary.
I met my sister, didn't I?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in closed space.
His concert was great.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you gonna go for a walk?
You should try it.
You're kind of worried.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems worried.
I'm worried about him.
Tom's out.
I'm assuming Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom's acting shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's sensitive.
Let's be brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if he had any help.
We could have found out.
This is no wine.
I don't like the taste of chromide.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom's gone to dinner.
Let's go for lunch.
It's hot since yesterday.
It must have been created somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped with a pool, a chair, a football game and a billiard table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all drunk.
I'll see you again.
Then we were so young.
I hear you've been wondering about me.
While he was eating a pizza, he came to his sister.
We should've given up early.
That's close enough.
Tom's a cop.
Don't count on them.
And I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work to date was crazy.
"Why do you do that?" "I can do it."
What a pig.
Lock the door.
Tom let go of the heating.
We're all the same.
I want to be next to you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that scary.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were Polish opponents: one was honest and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going to jump.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't forget.
She threw out the computer.
She bought it in the warehouse.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two species in Ireland.
One by one, the guys came to see what I'm reading.
Who are you living with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and phone calls.
These are wonderful.
Tom's got his hands on him.
Tom was awake.
I'm eating a testenine.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a kidnapper.
Where did Tom work?
I need to bring them back.
The noise ruined the whole city.
Whoever wants flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't fucking it.
They're close.
You're bad.
Did you hand Tom's note to him?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go to the kitchen.
Was it an explosion?
You have a little town.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you writing to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was ringing.
Is that Tom's coat?
This mass has a smooth surface.
She always wears an attack suit.
Tom was a boss.
It's a chest.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem, but mine.
Before I lay down, I drank three apples against the nose.
It's possible Tom isn't right.
Maybe they need help.
I don't have a vodka.
Tom's acting like a muffled dresser.
It's too bad you've ruined yourself.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I realized how much time we should go.
They're very good.
Do you want movies?
Time is forever.
First, you don't have the right to make decisions, secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
I see it's boring to the public.
I'm looking at the stock.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I believed them.
My mother had to borrow my keys.
Tom's got a rags.
It was a war.
And was Tom involved?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would be logical.
I'll wash my hands.
Choose one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're bad and you're disgusting.
Camoli, I could help you with more.
Tom's not looking anymore.
I think we're ready.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renewed the building's phase, and when I went by her car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible to have this?
We'll be hoping for this later.
If this happens again, tell me.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
That's right.
I know you're busy.
All the children sat around the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It will not be easy to do that without great help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
I sat next to you.
This isn't related to the subject.
I'll be back in a while.
She seemed deeply moved by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'll get divorced.
It's dinner.
My weight's breaking.
They're gonna make you weak.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge broke down when one of the eggs fell.
The geezirot blew the baby's water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
Tom keeps packing.
I don't have a home where I could go back.
I'm here for my own good.
To protect you.
He's always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you everything later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't care about math.
Take care of yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
In precious stones belong to the aquamarine, the amethyst, the murky, the quartet, and the ruby.
Go find them.
Previously, you had to ask your mother for permission.
I'll take Tom's place.
What made you come to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom hurt Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've got a lot to do with the cockroach.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've got a quick hand.
Tom remembered different things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'll go find her.
Of all the languages I learned, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote home.
I've numbered up to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
He looks like a monkey.
Peppers are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that hurt?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We've got a fresh goose with a compass.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you make money for the loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I have a seat?
They were all so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom showed Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have a home.
He was breathing deep.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman's easy to be ashamed.
Is that a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as it suits me.
Tom has a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I found something strange.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful algae.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was born to Mary.
Was I home alone?
He's offering a lot of money from her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
Do I look weak in this?
Can you do it on your own?
I'll go find another one.
I'm hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
The spiders make the spiders.
You're really talking a lot.
Maybe it's too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special cause.
Tom doesn't have to believe what others say.
He's in love with his head to the fifth.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
I think Tom's innocent.
Tom's in pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're too slow!
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm gonna do when I'm in retirement.
Tom recognized Mary's manuscript.
I think it's done enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do it.
Soon the sound's gone.
Who's freaking you out?
I don't even understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll come as soon as I can.
It's a police car.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how palm trees grow.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Tell me you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he couldn't eat dinner.
How's Tom coming in?
There's someone on the beach.
Tom wasn't getting away.
What doesn't kill me makes me strong.
Let's try and call her.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
I think it's possible to cook.
Free.
Peter may need some new fuel.
How's Tom going to work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom's not talking to me anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll get up.
I'm not running for you.
What's our situation?
Do you want me to hear him?
You're a real human being.
Boston is a great place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.
What led you to contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not that easy.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want them to treat me differently than before.
It should be all right.
I respected the rules.
Tom's a widow.
I think Tom's out of breath.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did that.
You're poor.
Give me another check.
Many Russians were killed while they were photographing themselves with their phones.
He feels that older newspapers are still useful.
I want them to invite me.
We see who laughs, but not who cries.
How old are you, Tom?
She was wearing a red marble around her neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
He was starving.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He's upset by listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
Now I can barely work.
When did Tom say he'd start his party?
This apparently was a hard decision on Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
You've done your job a very good day.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I've lost my mind.
It's hard to assess his abilities.
That's good.
I know the man sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I've been watching you before.
Stop where they are.
Are you a guide?
"She wants music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barbart cleared it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'll lose.
Her sister placed an injection against the flu.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom hasn't been here for a long time.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started taking Mary around the gym.
I don't have a name.
Why can't I ever win?
Tom fell off the stairs while he cleaned up his glasses.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, stupid!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be at school tomorrow.
Please, here.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
The next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
Everybody laughs.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote the messages?
Tom's making calls.
Tom was breathing deep.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to the bathroom?
Dan didn't want to go to the hospital again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel you need someone.
You'll never know.
I still think about him.
I thought it was my cause.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one's here.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
There's nothing more like a crazy drinker.
Take Tom.
Tom's getting dressed.
I know Tom's gone.
It looks nice.
We stayed in Boston.
This is almost the thing.
I can't concentrate on all of this.
Share the cards, Tom.
The bombers tied his mouth.
He's funny.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to celebrate you tonight.
Can't he wait for that?
They'll pay for their superiority.
Dan didn't miss any episode of that soap.
I love peppers.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the documents.
We have to ask you a few questions, Tom.
I thought Tom's gone well.
I hate as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the whole area.
Don't forget Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to come to his guest tomorrow morning.
Everyone's gonna thank me.
Here we are.
Why are they doing that?
I studied at school for four years and got nothing but poor diplomas.
This is the priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I'm not going to stay here that long.
We're together again.
In the fire, there's only one piece left.
Tom wants every green one except a green one.
Try to put yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write the stylus.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to adapt.
People can't do a miracle.
That's a little rough.
They decided to turn him away from their company.
Those who mix the Angolan endings "-ts" and "sit" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened then?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like he's got them everywhere.
I didn't count on that.
I've been unsatisfied.
I saw Tom last week.
It shouldn't take a long time for this.
I'm trying not to fuck up.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not so old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom closed two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't leave a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively to Spanish dictionaries for a whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really bad.
Do you want to get hurt?
It's said that the patterns of pathlicants contain a lot of nicotine.
I think I feel a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Are you speaking French?
Tom doesn't want surprises.
My wife is complete and devout.
I'll take him to Tom.
I don't think I can put the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom got ahead.
Tom's keeping his car well.
You're interested.
I can win this time.
All the people of the country came from a common practice.
Sometimes I'm right, and sometimes I'm not.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm fine.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the market.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
It's just that I'm tired.
I didn't do that on my own.
What is she?
Can people really think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks the Cavca language that has no common background and common English letters, can fully conquer English for just two years?
I'm just kidding.
Tom doesn't want milk.
Our attempts were empty.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the crazy one.
Tom laughed at him.
Are you missing Boston?
I think you should call him.
Every student has his boss.
Tom's not my guy.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work on a weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I have something for him.
How do I know if Tom's right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that beautiful sound?
This isn't his first late Tom.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It doesn't matter to you.
The students went.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where'd you go?
Your way is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flight and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You don't know how to do that, do you?
I'm sorry.
The blood runs through the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good the song is, Mary.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I'm singing under the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing the ball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I really want to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan drew a lesson in a tough way.
I showed them the fake of my friends.
I'm giving my employees the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that armament?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I like Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm fine.
He was eating chicken salads.
I'm going to run.
Tom's got something to do with it.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom never visited Boston.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get a hate.
Come and look.
Do you think you like it?
Integrity is a blessing, not a favor.
Tom's got his pulse speed.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She was furious about how the boy was kind, compassionate, courageous, and still I don't know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom believes in Mary.
You're busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks for the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped leaving.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sunflower in the mill.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the head is different from that of different people.
I got uncomfortable with the heteronormal propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't hold on for a long time.
The good guys are on their own as a reward.
That whole thing makes sense.
I'll open your door.
I saw an unidentified flight object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on television.
Tom's amazing whore.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
I don't care what I need.
They've got a good appetite this morning.
The old man made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This priest is very hard.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is he really a diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
She's doing a lot of sleepy things.
I prepared a cake with a cake last night.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!
Although the liver has both male and female reproductive systems, it needs another unit to bear.
Failure shamed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom's lost his mind.
Don't smoke here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm going there right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is estimated that the temperature of the sun’s surface is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd is gone.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John's birthday present.
Cover it up.
The police are looking for them.
How deep's the jacket?
The leaf is fresher out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll get Tom to examine it.
That was the shame.
I need Tom's address.
It's kind of sad.
I just didn't believe her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did he want to eat Tom?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom refused.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13 years old.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Somebody killed Tom.
Tom wasn't excited.
That was really bad.
This must be yours.
It's time we got here.
I was kind of sorry about you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left prints of their hands in the liquid cement.
Cavaler would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I spent your time.
That was unintelligent.
This is great.
Tom, don't do this to me.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check you out later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
Nobody deserves to die.
Then I didn't know what that meant.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would he do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where the goldsmiths hid them.
Fortunately, it's stable, otherwise the storm would suddenly blow it up last night.
I heard they caught her.
Tom's got it written somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for today?
I'll give up.
In Mary’s eyes, her eyes shined with joy.
It's bad for them to fly.
I only have one minute.
Tom's never giving up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How much do you want, boys?
I'd like a little question.
I'm sorry about your persistent complaints.
Don't you care what's gonna happen to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making a secret.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too soon.
You scared her.
Tom lied to us.
What did I say?
Tom bought a hat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman lied.
Everything's in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was.
Were you home in ten?
It's closed today.
Please tell Tom.
I'll make it help you.
I called the police.
I can't afford Ken to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could he be Tom?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's just a job.
I hear there's a big competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to talk to her.
I don't need a chart.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing Tatoeba's new version.
Looks like it's okay.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn't even know I was playing basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to keep the talk.
Tom's not for sport.
I'm dangerous, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Publish your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I really want to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only one who survived the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom doesn't laugh.
I started seeing him.
We'll make it faster.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
It's a miracle.
The kidneys release chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It would be best not to speak that way.
This is a new model.
I gave you a hand.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's nice to see you, Tom.
I was kind of sorry about her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off the bike.
Why do the ants have big ears?
Come here!
You could have refused.
Why wouldn't you let me help you?
It'll happen soon.
Hey, it's funny here, get me out of here before I shout.
It's gonna happen.
I heard that story.
It's still dark out there.
That's what Tom meant.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We need to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was acting decently.
I guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay as you like.
This is your wine.
I just gave them.
This is the best painting.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak clearly?
Where's the meeting going?
Let's play "Truth or challenge."
His conclusions are based on unproved assumptions.
There were a lot of girls on the party.
Tom started dividing the book.
That's the right reason.
Tom really likes flowers.
Tom told Mary to be full.
I'm tired.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
You know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song for me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long have you been in front of the computer?
To my wife, she's getting tired of the daily routine.
I want to know how you did that.
The ambis are monocellular organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom took my hand off.
You're crazy!
How late is the train?
Let's park there.
That's so stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but it's tough today.
I'm fine.
He went in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This isn't fair for me.
It's possible someone's been following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all the money in his pocket.
Camoli, I'd like to meet her.
They were laughing.
I'd like to hear from him.
It's a leather strap.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This is not gonna work.
You're gone soon.
The children were so excited about the party that they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were hungry.
This is hard for him.
I'm sorry.
Do you think we're gonna get to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her mistress.
An international language would be a powerful tool for mankind.
I gave them some help.
Has it already been decided?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't bother me at all.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't just leave the baby.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's good-bye.
What time is it?
Nice weekend.
Do you want hot water?
Tom missed the girls.
We wanted to be scared.
Tom works differently today.
Get them out of the deck.
Japan as a country has a lot of different looks.
It's disturbing.
That was a offer I couldn't refuse.
The monks used to play tennis on the monsters.
Don't be so perfunctory!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your pay.
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got a little shacks.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I'm not speaking German.
The test covered mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom over the money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you know how to swim?
Don't pressure Tom.
They betrayed me.
And there's a paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you kept your speech.
This sentence has five words.
He was eating chicken creams, cheeses, and soups for dinner.
We were waiting for them outside.
It's not as comfortable as Tom.
It's easier like this.
Tom's been cheating on you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not an option.
How old were you when your children got divorced?
The French is hard.
I'm very rarely asking questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor looks at the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
Dimote is asleep in the air.
The printer doesn't work.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark here.
Tom's a hero.
This was too much for her.
Tom was wondering what would happen if he pressed the son button.
If you saw Tom, could you give him this?
We can order a pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is comfortable.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary was representing her team in the game.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like eggs.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm the only one.
We don't want new disasters.
There's no way he was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have a major obstacle to becoming early, even when it is necessary.
Give me the gloves.
I've seen Tom.
Who's there with you?
Why are you so excited?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom went mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanicals should be understood in oil and motorists.
How was it yesterday?
You have to learn valuable.
We can't leave them alone.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have lunch.
I smell my honey.
Tom and Mary explained the rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They're sick, aren't they?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I took my knife off.
They were dancing.
Tom took off his jacket.
We're not free.
I'm lying in ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy's touching me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I locked it up.
Tom's still calm.
He told you you'd help.
Cells are the main components of living organisms.
They're having fun.
I have to go get dressed.
How long are you working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
We were born one day after my older sister died.
He's been riding for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in such a place.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
I'm a clastrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom quickly lost his weight.
As far as you know, I don't care.
No, I'm still a baker.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That surprises me.
This is the job we talked about a day ago.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a death - dealing disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the angle.
She betrayed me.
Why are you marrying when we're getting married?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom's finally laughing.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would he like that tom?
I've misjudged her.
It'll be done a little bit more.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was ready to shoot me.
Tom's talking.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary's philanthropic coffee.
Don't say that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the soul.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They colored the edges of the window.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
How did I get dressed?
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing his blood.
I have to stay here.
It's all or nothing.
This information is reliable.
I've come for them.
My life changed.
No one's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholics?
You and I will fly with the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom doesn't listen.
I'll bring the wine.
I'll remember that.
How long does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour before the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird took off the border with the clown and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone laughed at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's incredibly calm.
I'll ask Tom to set aside time for you tomorrow Saturday.
What the hell did he buy?
Tom was trying to free himself.
What am I gonna do to them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time now.
I'll be back home in the morning.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep once.
He's been more than I thought he'd be.
Tom runs near Mary.
I've got a cat.
Tom's not old.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a haircut?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got his blond hair.
To live the SSR!
It's strong.
I want to buy Annas.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
A simple question is where.
The Grim Forest.
Tom was involved.
I'm afraid of it.
How did you know Tom was gonna betray me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
The monkeys are wonderful creatures.
There are three brothers.
I don't know if I'm gonna have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with a bottle.
With other words, my grandmother's a bit of a head.
We've lowered Tom.
You've got enough to wear.
We want more money.
Don't lose.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom's got a hole in his face.
Don't you believe us?
I respect you.
Be kind.
Let's follow the others.
Before I sleep, I hear music.
I'll pray for them.
They're my bitches.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
It's hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of mixing your teeth every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom's out there.
This is the most reliable counselor of the king.
Did you buy this for her?
Go get dressed.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where's that from?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you could imagine.
No one's gonna be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a hand watch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't realize Mary wasn't at the party.
He's changing his job.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide that.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom keeps fighting.
Tom might be able to burn your car.
Do you hear that?
What did they find?
You lied to me.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to change.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They're just going to beat Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the explosives.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him a lesson.
I don't have anything to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on the street.
It's a little crazy, so be honest.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's going south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's for you now.
That's a very modern explanation.
The trips before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll do it.
It's too risky to fight them at their level of choice.
Wasn't it terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I hate his bad attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's just that.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt right away.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, okay?
It was a good night!
Check it out.
Multiplication is communicative, and division is not.
I'm busy.
Tom took his hat off and gave it up.
We're taking off our oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what it says in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom was loud.
It was Peter.
Tom started to say.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We're holding two horses.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone showed it to her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die by Saturday.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was unconscious.
Limenca's empty.
There's trouble in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend you were listening to Tom for the first time?
Tom left his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money closed my eyes.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We've all been training for her.
Didn't you see the olive tree?
Get out of my way!
I told you it'd be hard to figure out.
I think I found one.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food for a week.
I don't even understand you.
Even though I'm a kind man, I'm a man.
Tom's sorry he's late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
She deserves the reward.
Can we talk?
Where are we headed?
Tom is basically doing the same thing that Mary does.
We have to examine something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't go out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary felt it.
We met in the menu.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't let her go.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned around the whole city looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Night's life is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine has to drink on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
It's my fault.
I can't let anyone pay.
Tom said the house was broken.
You've been eating a centuries' bread.
The pigs from Marsipan don't rot.
Tom woke up.
Tom blew up Mary.
What do the whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is about it.
Tom might come today.
Tom doesn't differ between reality and fantasy.
Tom's young.
Tom doesn't have the power to do it.
Will you help me?
Don't let me be disappointed.
Tom wasn't home when I got back.
I still don't understand.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's go one more time.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom's doing bad things.
I was home all night.
We got out of there in about an hour.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of family are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
They're coming to me.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I think they still don't have a cure for it.
Every member must attend.
She didn't understand the joke.
This is the tallest snow I've ever seen.
I hope he's going abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The fresco is made of a bee.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on that subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
It's my 60th birthday today.
I'm married to Larry.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom.
Did Tom buy gifts?
You two are very sweet together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible I'm not right.
What's happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You cut your key ass while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a base here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was touched.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom's holding on to hard vegan food.
I drive my car once a week.
Please report them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was ready.
Take care of the road.
We'll stop by the way.
I heard Tom running.
This has tea taste.
I wouldn't spend the nerves for that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look mad?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Let me go.
The stone ran down the bridge.
She went to the fridge.
Tom's no different.
Come on!
Don't make his heart.
You don't have to comment.
The chicken is serious.
Tom didn't want to sit down with Mary.
Tom's not so young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very cute.
You're very brave.
Sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
He was all right here.
They seem surprised.
I could make it easy for you.
Put the phone down.
He'd never come out of the house after the pope.
I think Tom's a cuppy.
He's sick of a terrible infection and he's sick and he's gone.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
He's not coming in.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's sometimes acting weird.
We're gonna cover them.
Now it's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What's Tom saying?
Why don't we take it?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a pair of shoes.
You're powerful.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we cut the cake out of the cap?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent one.
I had to protect Tom.
This is very relaxing.
Call him right away.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have tonne questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even fascinating story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language has a different view of the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Get dressed like a pigeon.
Nawaka.
This is the world.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come and drink with us.
Let's just stop talking.
My birthday is July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the shop.
I'm ready for that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's an atheist.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we got up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another one.
I don't know if I'm going to sit down or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm strong.
Are you interrupting him?
We just found them.
I hated my tongue.
I'm calling.
I've lost eight in time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I'm gonna have a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people gather in the room?
I've been thinking about that.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't answered her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've turned your ass off.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little involved.
