I'm going to my toothbrush.
You can reverse the slider selection with a circle or ponym.
When are you going to do this?
She will try again.
Was the soup delicious?
What does he do?
Tom did not have the chance that you and I had.
Many birthdays will soon arrive.
It's a solo train.
Saturday my father is open.
What he said angered us.
He speaks not only French but also Spanish.
I don’t think anything happened to what you did.
That's a nice couple of bees.
One, three and five are different numbers.
Did they sign?
He needed water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never did.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
This was not just the effort.
We're a little late.
No one's going to worry.
Hello!
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The package weighs more than one pound.
I know how you felt about him.
It will be our secret.
This powder is white.
He's watching some TV.
Drink!
Do not miss the opportunity.
It's a little cool.
He's better than me.
Tom showed me his new way.
It is easy to view humans as unique among other living organisms.
The sick person had the best possible care.
You work too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not going to buy anything.
Tom wouldn't cry.
"I never thought of it," said the old man. "What will we do?"
Forget about them.
Tom didn't tell a story to kill.
Mary is Tom's wife.
Where are the other girls?
Root reporting providers were not allowed inside.
I like cold pizza.
He didn't wear a hat.
He condemned racial discrimination as an option.
I'm drinking water.
The food was not so bad.
She is two years older than you.
I never said that.
I don't blame you.
She was faithful to him.
If I were you, I would start immediately.
She has blond hair.
Do you know Tom from Mary?
I'll be here when you come back.
When does Tom eat?
You're the wine.
I forgot about him.
The horse is in the forest.
Another coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
Okay, I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where's Tom eating?
We implemented that plan.
You had to attend the meeting.
You can read my letter and correct the mistakes if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
All the houses were washed away with the river.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to buy a car.
What should I do about her?
If a search is made for thousands of paper scraps, her wishes will be true.
Tom had forgotten about them.
Do not let it be for the train.
If you find something you're good with and what you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.
You wouldn't believe me.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
I was sad to hear of her.
Whatever you do, don’t let the new phone fall.
Why don't you help me get caught?
It's not a joke.
Tom is not going to make any deliveries today.
The eye is the soul’s mirror.
The son who writes the best wins the prize.
Tom won't stay with us next week.
I work with this company.
Tom can't swim.
You drink water.
She loved him.
Tom didn't go.
Do you have a phone?
Do you know the boy who cries?
Tom will help you.
You don't need a mirror.
Dogs.
If the idiots would compete, you would come second because you are too fat to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom didn’t come.
I don't want to remember.
Blitsny!
They are in the library.
Tom would rather not have done that.
She's very nice.
I don't want to see her.
I don't know where we're going to open.
Tom got up early.
This is life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He didn’t feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue shirt is my daughter.
Our teacher started a good song.
We're not going to open everything.
But you know that these negative consequences would come.
He will never believe me again.
Tom set his judge straight.
The two villages were separated by a river.
We decided not to let them go.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your daughter.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know anything about them?
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I'm drinking tea.
I was sad to hear of him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I’m not going to get into it to do it.
All we can point to is true, but what is real is the real question.
I live in Norway now.
Tom can't die.
I won't be able to help you.
Nobody tells me what to do.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Can you write an English letter?
My name is Tom.
It's a memory from Hokkaido.
I told you before, didn't I?
Don't hit the dog with a stone.
This guy's screaming for me!
Be more careful now.
Please go faster.
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
The United States will one day choose a woman as president for the first time, and there will be joy about the long-term opportunity.
You just ruined my life!
We'll contact you when your table is ready.
Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I received letters from a person I have never met.
My dad's name is Fritz.
Do you speak French?
I'm in a playroom.
Do not believe everything people tell you.
I don't speak French well enough!
I can't get a ride for a minute.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a bright, big summer day at the end of June.
Why should I lie?
Let's go.
I'll go back to my office.
I don't speak any Japanese.
I too am unemployed.
Can I survive later?
Tom was very shy.
I have to go.
Tom won't worry.
Sami corrected this last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I'll put my shoes in a japtrap.
Tom tried to keep it going.
Tom won't watch it.
My horse is black.
If this is a lie, she's a liar.
I was worried about them.
My friend wrote me a letter to find out how I was.
I would like to send this package to Canada.
Why should Tom do this?
Don't you add sugar?
I’m not afraid.
She's doing her homework now.
What are you going to wear at school today?
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The wall was a light brown grave.
You're scared of him.
Tom won't see me.
Maybe I shouldn't be so confused.
How many letters are there in the alphabet?
He's a man of faith.
Tom won't die.
I don't want to see you.
He's judging jazz.
When did you last vote?
She can answer your question.
Can I take a look at your card?
I wish you were near me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you in the morning.
I don't see anything.
Tom committed suicide by kicking off a bridge.
Dreams always come out.
Ping pong is also known as table tennis.
I'm sure I'm not going to be of much help.
The air is blue, the sea is also blue. The air and the sea is blue.
Robert was so excited that he had to show an invitation to play golf from his hand.
Tom won't wait here for so long.
He's my brother.
All human beings are born free, equal in dignity and rights, having reason and consciences, and should be united in the spirit of brotherly affection.
They are worried about her.
Television consumes more than the sunglasses.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.
I’m already used to it now.
Can you make a copy for me?
What is he doing here?
I finish my homework.
Is it hot like that?
My home had two bedrooms.
Where's your luggage?
Who has called this song into the dance?
Can You Turn Away the Light?
He reads the newspaper every morning.
She stopped working.
He's young.
Tom was on his way.
Who built this house?
He cannot speak many English.
I just wondered if you could find a place to stay.
I don't want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom won't stop.
Martha's a great piano.
Let us take a closer look.
The news spread rapidly.
Do you have a firewall?
Chinese food made the biggest impression in China.
Please hurry!
The dog broke through the hole, into the garden.
Can I take a day's leave?
The warm bath relieved my muscles.
Read this book.
Did he write letters in English?
We've got a big garden.
Don’t buy your money by buying things you don’t need.
Good luck!
Tom told me to do it.
She's got a house at the sea.
Have you ever been in Paris?
That's the last shot.
We know each other very well.
Thank you very much!
She seemed beautiful.
We're all going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He speaks not only French but also Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Place the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your first name is on the list.
Is this necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Were you at work yesterday?
Sami hates to talk about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun set, they left their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She's running hard.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that little cat?
He was a good king.
They said that they had always done so.
We're looking for each other.
I'm just looking at it.
Unfortunately, Tom will not be able to come.
Tom said he thought that Mary still lived with her parents.
I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn’t be surprised.
It smells.
In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were still very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was her decision.
I really didn’t want to win.
I am no longer afraid.
I hoped we could become friends.
Tom's alive.
My father made his own furniture.
He does not like traveling by plane.
We had nothing to lose.
You stay with a friend.
He asked my mother.
Does that make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
Her music is famous.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice. I'm not going to make things that you say.
That's quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom doesn't seem well.
I had to imagine myself.
Let's practice.
It was hard for him to remove his pride, which he felt was his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said he didn’t heal Mary.
The clock's playing.
I can't get out of this cell.
I don't have time for you.
They said that they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I did.
I'm a friend of Robert.
I want to be her friend.
Don't move.
I heard about him.
Peter is in love with Jane.
I remember listening to her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
I will be very careful.
Earlier this time was at the zoo.
Are you a girl or a son?
Mike has two girls.
Let us wait until he arrives.
Tom colored his hair dark brown.
That's what you get!
Are you going to die, Tom?
A dog ran behind the cat.
I also slept for Tom.
Why not join us for evenings?
It's a horse.
Tom was arrested.
It's not a joke.
You promised you'd come.
I would be embarrassed to expect such a thing.
Christmas is still in the North Pole.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
I got bribes.
Let's sit down on the TV.
Unfortunately, I would not be very good company.
You won't be able to help us.
You are the love of my life.
Yet I would betray you.
Tom drinks more than anyone I know.
I like church.
He's not always home Sunday.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
Tom has to go.
I don't have to sleep tonight.
I want to leave empty.
The song is easy to learn.
Where did you learn it?
You, too.
I completely forgot about them.
She chose to be pregnant under pressure from her parents.
I need to help my mother.
He lives in a village near Osaka.
You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you had been in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and got a flashlight.
I think I might be out of work.
I told Tom I'd be now.
My son still believes in Kersvader.
I hate to run it.
Sami needs to wait a minute.
Are they friends?
Tom knows all about them.
It is dangerous to go into that area on your own.
Sami did not notice it.
Do you wash your hands?
Can I cut your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm now-now back with translations.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks at the lake.
Tom's hand was cold.
She is, of course, tired of reading.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Do you have a phone?
Mr. Mitchell asked me to pay the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he is.
I put it back where it belongs.
I'll take a book.
Tom rescued his phone in the car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I keep dreaming about her.
Tom didn't wear socks.
Tom won't say.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not yet very hungry.
There's probably a easy solution to your problem.
I completely forgot about her.
We have to start doing this.
It is difficult to live in Japan.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot about her.
However, Tom was wrong.
I don't want to marry.
I'm talking about him.
Tom might die.
If you get up, he will be studying.
I've got a bad skin.
We're his sons.
The birds are beautiful.
The bakery lasted a week.
When did you last lie?
Tom won't perform a meeting today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom sits on a window to read a book.
We're not going to be here after 2:30.
I like it to eat meat.
However, we could do it at 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Do you know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He shot me!
She read the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the victim’s home.
Please forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food was not so bad.
I'm eating rice.
Hey, can I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It smells.
Tom will be late.
I'm going to take you to the roof.
I just bought a few new shoes.
We want it back.
The battle begins in the morning.
They can overcome fear.
This cannot be a true diamond.
Tom's gone.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my collection.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer getting help from Mary.
I am struggling to find out so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I am to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are busy.
It does not matter what he says should not be trusted.
You had to visit Kyoto.
I got up when it was dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we would have to think about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we were married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Let the sea roar, when the wind was red, wind and night, and the cold could penetrate the thickest garment, especially on the sea, a poor boat with only two men entering the sea.
Nights are all cat sizes.
Styller!
It's my house now.
A little plane.
He's been up for 30 minutes.
He reaches out to an English-Japan dictionary on the reader.
Whatever a man sows, he will also reap.
I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not complain.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You'll pay for it.
I've been looking for a place to stay.
Tom has a lot on his table.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot about her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, for example Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for the evenings.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's so funny!
The river that is flowing by Paris is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
