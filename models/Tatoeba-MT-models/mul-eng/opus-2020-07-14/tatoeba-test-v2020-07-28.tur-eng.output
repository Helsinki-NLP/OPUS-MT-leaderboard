I spent the whole morning cleaning my room.
Which of these do you think is the best table?
Jim's going to school on a bus.
Who's gonna pay the account?
I know something really fun we can do tomorrow.
The bus driver is a good friend of mine.
Layla refused to explain herself.
He's teaching English.

Sami, he was looking for Leyla again.
I'm completely in a new state of shock.
How did you get my number?
What's Tom doing?
Tom wanted Mary to take him to the office.
It doesn't matter.
It's not over.
You can't treat me like that.
I'll be happy to serve you.
Tom was in a coma.
Tom didn't let me help him.
Do you know what that song says?
Make him a salesman.
We went to dance.
He's a member of the baseball club.
Think about your life.

Why don't you just ask him yourself?
100 bucks a night in the room.
Atari 2600, he'd pop up at the beginning of seconds.
I hope nobody steals my stuff.
Tom's not going to school today.
Sami was taking cocaine.
I need to find a way to help them.
Did you hear that?
I need to check this report for accuracy.
I think you're a kilo.
The problem is everyone's too afraid to talk to Tom.
We're almost home now, Tom.
Who's Tom talking about?
I'm learning Chinese.
You just did good.
He didn't care about Tom.
Who's benefiting from this?
I asked Tom that he didn't know my brother's name.
He can't eat good food.
It's a direct receipt.
Do you know how it's done?
Tom's gone.
Gold is harder than snow.
I told her.
When will the birthday party be arranged?
Absolutely!
This can be done.
The restaurant we're going to eat tonight, close to where I work.
I'm worried you'll take a dance like Tom.
I asked you to leave Tom alone.
How many computers have you been so far?
I miss you.
I don't think they're teachers.
She was so afraid to leave.
He's worried about the soldiers.
They didn't need money.
That's not just reasonable.
Please take care of him.
No one blames you for a crime.
I heard you wanted to see me.
Tom thought his answer very carefully.
You came right on time.
Tell me what kind of food you want to eat.
Tom left the door open.
Someone just shut down the lights.
Game time.
What do you expect to buy?

We have to keep going.
We'll call him.
Now we're friends.

I wish you were here.
He'll run as fast as another class friend.
He's slowing down his illness.
Not all these books are useful.
Tom must've been back by now.
Why are we hiding?
I'm pretty sure Tom can't do this.
What I'm telling you about him is for his brother.
Don't give up your trolls.
Maybe I shouldn't sell my law.
Some think he's a bad idea.
Tom said he wasn't sure you wanted to do this.
Tom's a kid myself.
This is where I forgot.

Tom looks great.
He was still there.
You're the first class student in the university, right?
It's the man who suggested to Mary that she do this.
I brought you a little something.
His eyes were full of eyes.
Do they have any idea what they're doing?
What do you suggest I do?
I've never been robbed.
We didn't realize Tom was here so early.
Why do you hate your country?
I've already apologized for him.
Communistism is a system used by the Soviet Socialist Society.
You won't regret taking Tom to work.
I slept in the face.
I missed Tom, too.
You can't get back on time.
Tom put his head down and looked at the distance.
You want to see your room?
What they're writing about in the newspapers is shocking.
He sat there holding his arms.
I was so suspicious.
Tom saved me from a big fight.
I'm not treated like that.
The air was cold.
His mother didn't know what to do about his son.
I'll have him by the end of the week.
Tom took your coat and put it on his ear.
Tom sat on the driver's seat.
Good day, isn't it?
Call me in the morning.
I came to you because I wanted to help.

I'm sorry, but can I ask you something?
We need to get rid of him.
Because she bought some fruit and some.
I have to figure out how much I'm gonna spend next week.
How much money did you get from Tom to fix his car?
Are you having a nice day with Tom?

What are you talking about, Tom?
I want to take you with me.
Tom must stay in the hospital for at least a week.
Tom must be shot.
He's mad at you because you weren't at the last meeting.
Tom is a salesman.
Great, I'll see you later.
When do you care what we're doing?
Unfortunately, it's not a "sadful" word.
Everyone's yelling at me.
You and I are not.
I wasn't expecting to win.
Turn left and it's the last place on your right.
Tom told Mary she wouldn't live forever.
The machine's so hot that it's easy to break.
We were all alone.
I hate the outside.
It's already empty.

You're not gonna help us.
I wish I could sing as good as Lady Gaga.
I heard Tom didn't get too tired.

It's Tom's guy who thinks we're supposed to have a beer.
I'll have to reimburse the batteries.

Do I have a solution?
I shot him in the face.

My mom didn't give me a birthday cake this year.

You can't continue this way.
Of course I'm gonna play for Tom.
It's like the air's hot, isn't it?
Stop staring at yourself.
That wasn't a big argument.
Tom was able to park behind the hotel.
Just get out of here.

We'll try to do what we can.
Tom was hiding something.
I think Tom's great.
It's the sound of the train.
Tom wasn't around.
We're going out for dinner, you want to come?
Maybe Tom should do it.
I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
Let's go to Boston together.
Why we're coming to know that name.
I took my passport photo last week.
Tom won't leave us.
Whenever we discuss a family, my husband will always keep his mother's side in my place.
Tom was laughing at Mary's letter.
Mary needs some advice.
I haven't visited Boston yet.
I believe this is a gift.
It looks nice, I think I'll try.
What would you do if the rain was raining?
We don't have to go.
We continue to hope that things will improve.

Did you decide?
You made a fatal mistake.
Tom doesn't want to go to the hospital.
You made it all possible.

His mind is different from mine.
Let's take a look at the problem.

Since he lost his job a year ago, Tom's been looking for a job.
We have three torsos.
I'm worried that Tom can't help us.

I think Tom already knows why Mary doesn't want to do this.
We're not scared.
After a short battle, they won.
My eyes must be lying to me.
The dog was stuck on his feet.

That's a great music!
I'm in the balcony.
When do you think I can talk to Tom?
There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is a Messenger.
Tom never lied to me as much as I knew.
Tom is the only person Mary's been talking to so far.
You spent a good morning, didn't you?
Tom was killed, too, and Mary.
I just want to explain.
How proud are you?
We both know what happened to Tom.

It's the end of the sentence.
How did you change that?
I'll do it all day.
He's cooled his cold friends.
I'm not sure what I have to do is that.

I want you to wear this.
I don't want to look like a tourist.
Everyone stood up and went.
Please don't shoot me.
Which animal do you like most?
I ran out feeling the house was broken.
Tom was sent to the warehouse.

He made a spectacular move across the surface of the water.

Honestly, I can tell you she's not me.

Did you ever ask me a question, and I didn't answer?
First of all, we have to decide on the name.
If you have faith in God, you will have a good life, and you will have a good life.
I did it right.
It's a ghost.
"How do you get Tom from going to the police?" "I'll offer him money."
It was three days ago.

We're all going together.
I didn't.
What's Tom reading now?
You're open.
This letter is my only key.
Where did you get them to court?
Tom, he's probably not gonna tell Mary he wants to help John.
Can you answer me?
What else did Tom do?

Did you answer Tom's question?
What do you have to do now?

He took note of what he said.
The group was released early in 1791.
Tom died three years ago.
It's about throwing her document.
I'm sure he'll pass the test.

Tom likes to work in the library.
Please don't die.
He's bringing Tom Mary a fine cup of tea.

There's a pasta in the box.
I hate people who say it.
Actually, I don't know anything about these plans.
Thank you for having a nice meal.

We have to get on the couch.
Tom's making a bath in my kitchen.

Did you open all the boxes?
I gave it to them yesterday.
Tom's probably gonna be an asshole.
According to Dan, Linda insisted.
I met Tom after work.
She's been cold here until Marta.

He waited patiently for her.
I'm sick of being sick.
When Tom came here, the air was coming.
Tom was supposed to have a lawyer.
Get your hands out of your ass.

The sugar bag.
How much do you have to take?
"It's gone." "He's gone." "He's gone." "He's been nine."
I'm so tired of being healthy.
