From my point of view, the literature programme was formed by women of the age of Balzak on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature in the 19th century, we prefer Danilev and Volkon.
They wrote belletistics, of course, from the perspective of the greatest gifts of balsako’s age.
And the psychological and suffering of the heroes of Tolst and Turgen are not so interesting for adults.
I'm getting a lot of interest in hero psychology.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Matras Promtex Micropocket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige model: Comfortability and natural composition.
The matrix has different strengths: the medium-temperature surface is formed by a latexed coke and natural latex, moderately soft – a flat natural latex.
The circumference block of 1000 millimetres is quickly adapted to the body of the fan by warning of the "volna" or "gamaka" effect.
The value of the model should be given to learning materials.
Latex, perforated for air conditioning, is highly ventilated in a natural way, just like a cocoon.
As a result, the rest of the rest of the place remains healthy.
The extended guarantee period is also extended to matras.
The period of official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, for the period of operation of the matrix.

Germany: Fourth coronavirus infection
The fourth vaccination will be required by summer or June 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with the new force.
Despite the active fertilization campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccines are likely to be insufficient for full protection.
In this confidence, the director of the Association of Doctors' Common Practice, Ulrich Wigelt.
This is what Die Welt reports on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will take place in the summer, later on," the expert believes.
In addition, Wigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccine from the coroner could be carried out “in combination with the influenza vaccine”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccines can help to combat the spread of a new Omicron-based corona virus.
I'm talking about a new option that's especially dangerous.
Yes, the likelihood of Omicron re-infection three times higher than the Delta or Beta strains.
This is reflected in the results of the preliminary study carried out at UAR.
Accordingly, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against the new Omicron virus.
The study BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses, the vaccine was significantly below: "Naturalizing potential decreases more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against micro-smom damage," the BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on speeding up vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society of Infectious Diseases Bernd Zaltzberger said that there was a decrease in the interval between the second and third stages.
More than Salzberger believes, the rapid vaccination has an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the micron variant of the corona virus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing," the expert emphasized.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special spring of Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (such as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other killers, which has been created significantly with regard to the use of the freshwater fish, not only for the hunting of the salmon.
These attacks have greater impact on the use of such analytics than in the close-up of the analogues, which is certainly a positive impact on the Nunuances of the use of such analogous immunities.
The second known feature is the top of the solid and solid plastics that create additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal orbits.
As a winter killer, the Bet-A-Vib response shows a pretty aggressive game.
Often the most powerful is the simple monotonous animation, which is the movement of the driver up and down almost without a break.
When planning a release from the vertical axis, it is not very big, which is convenient for hunting in a limited area, with underforested vegetation, corals and other obstacles that can be overcome.
In addition, a small deviation is actually made in the case of a horse and a large eagle, especially in the middle of winter when precise and aggressive information is required.
Reaching the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib is gradually developed and returned to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib, however, is also used for the winter hunting of the ferret.
You can choose from two modifications: with or without your nose capsule (NS - NanoSound).
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib games in response can be broken down by a passive stick that does not even respond to the victim.
Bet-A-Vib fires demonstrate continuity and accuracy in hunting.
It is understood and uncognizable, and it is well combined with smooth and flat shrubs even with large diameters.
To hunt the prey, the hunter, the eagle, or the eagle, except for the equivalent of the actual and "step", sometimes with the church on the ground.
If you hunt in the ordered areas, you can change the previous triangle to a double, which will reduce the probability of a stroke.
In the middle of the denial of its Bet-A-Vib class among the most sustainable in the work and as a result, one of the most vulnerable.
The same can be used with equal success both in small and in large areas.
All models are equipped with ownner ST-36 bugs.

In Libya, there were 7 000 Russian employers
There are more than 7,000 employees of the private military company (CWC) Wagner in Libya.
On 12 December, the President of the High Council of the Republic of the Haled al-Mishiri made this statement.
"There are now more than 7,000 Vagner Länder in Libya.
They also have planes.
They're also growing up in Sirte and Kuffre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft on the Gardabiya planes (also used as a civil airport in Sirte), " - a statement by the Anadolu Agency.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian investors were "tested" to capture the central part of Libya, which spread from Chad to the Mediterranean, after they “will bring their man to authority” in the Central African Republic.
Keep the presence
In the opinion of the publishing contractor, Moscow sought the country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "replaced in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019 and has been using the airport and port in Sirte, as well as the airport in Jufre, noted in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that Vagner is supported by CWC.
Where the Locusts Can Be Still
According to the agency, Wagner is expected to operate in nine countries in Africa - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides for the training of local forces, the protection of leaders and the protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's daughter companies receive certain privileges and licences for the use of useful and natural resources, as well as for the provision of arms, technology and military services in those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, "wagners" were fighting in Donbasse, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group does not mean either in the powerful offices or in the jury register, but its soldiers are not in the formal lists of the staff.
The company is subject to US sanctions.
Remember, earlier in the 27 EU countries had approved resistance against Wagner.
It is expected that this decision will be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Government Council of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament with consultative functions with its dominant Islamists, TASS writes.
The body repeatedly called for a single day of vote on the election of Members of Parliament and Heads of State from 24 December as a minimum at February 2022.
"The elections will last less than two weeks, and they will be severely reduced in the future," said the material.
On this basis, the Supreme Electoral Commission of Libya has deferred the deadline for the final list of candidates, transmitted by Sky News Arabia.
Russian Foreign Policy
38 per cent of Russians see more success in foreign policy than in failure, 29 per cent believe they are overpowering failures.
"Syria's success is "protected, restored peace there", "Sovereign Volcano-2", "the whole world was afraid of that cruel weapon", "We're sorry."
The main failures - the conflict with Ukraine, the conflict with the West, the isolation of the world - are said to be in the study of the Fund "A general opinion".
The Government of Dubai has completely rejected the accounting industry, and all the ministers have become only digital
The Government of Dubai reported a complete rejection of accounting and transfer to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively by electronic means.
This is reported by the Emerial Information Agency WAM.
"Today has marked the beginning of a new phase of the digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed our transition to a completely non-bumable government," said the successor prince of the era, President of the Dubay Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Muhammad Ben Rashid Al Mactoum.
Now the internal and external documentation board in all households will be conducted only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected everything without exception from the industry: health, HIV, police, municipal bodies, courts and so on. Many business structures have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to the electronic government and the digitalization of the billing began in Dubai since 2018.
At the same time, as the authorities had estimated, 336 million wallets, consisting of 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Former Mr. Moskev Sergei Sobayin stated that electronic services would be available to citizens for 2 days a year.

Turkey ' s production and export of cars fell below the 2020 level
Turkey's production and export of cars has declined dramatically in November on the basis of oil-evaluation.
As a result, industry indicators over the past 11 months have resulted in a lower annual result, Bloomberg reports, referring to the association of Turkish car manufacturers.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were released in Turkey, at least 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
A total of 75.9 thousand vehicles were exported, with more than 25 per cent being admitted to the previous year.
And if the Turkish car sector had demonstrated positive dynamics over the past year in the first 10 months of this year, the emissions of cars had already increased by 0.3 per cent in the past year by 11 months in 2021.
Such a fall has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the Turkish lira rate, which fell 29 per cent in November with respect to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a loan payment delay in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, spoke of the situation in providing benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, transmitted the MIA "Kasinform".
“On the information provided by the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, in the current year following the order of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency adopted an order of 9 April 2021 No. 127 on the approval of the arrangement for the delay in payment of small and medium-sized enterprises”, Alian Smailov wrote in his reply to a parliamentary request.
He recalled that the provision of the loan payment schedule provided for the provision by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, the payment period for loans issued before 1 April 2021 by SMEs, including IPAs, for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deadline was from 30 to 90 days after the MSB sub-item was selected.
Another time limit for payment may be specified in the applicant's statement.
The claimant ' s claim-finding work, the need for payment of arrears, and the acquisition of a creditor of commissions and other payments were suspended during the period of retirement".
In 2021, applications were made at the second level in the bank for an interest rate of 603 MIC loans, from which 553 MIC sub-items were received at a rate of 9.7 billion tonnes.
In the IMF, applications were made for a period of 131 MSB, of which 95 entities were granted a total of 105.8 million tonnes," concluded A. Smailov.
Plummonologist Purisev suggested that people with poor immunity could easily carry the stomach of "comron"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry it easier than those with a strong immune response.
Plummonologist Sergey Prussiav explained why the stem of the coroner virus could be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in terms of the occurrence of the virus.
Scientists believe that "comiron" was born into the body of an infected HIV or a suffering immunodeficiency.
That's why he didn't meet any resistance to immunity when he was mutated.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, he became very quick.
We see, there he has these chips, chips, maybe more than it is, their antibodies didn't come out during the mutations -- comments Plummologist Sergey Purisev.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry "comron" easier than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that the strong response of the organism to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is also true of pneumatic infections when young people are 30 years of age and older than they are in their 60 ’ s.
The immune response of a young man is completely inadequate: where it could only endanger the finger, it will be as if it were from a gun on the job, and Sergei Purisev concluded.
The doctor also reminded the cancer virus that there are dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
The explosion of light is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very well and quickly, the second is often only symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will begin the intoxicating of the organism: temperature, weakness, lack of support.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, first in the throat, cough.
Whether left or right, abstinence can also bear witness to the developing problem.
At the same time, in Russia, up to the end of the year, the ageing generation can be vaccinated from 12 to 18 years.
The director of the MFTI genetic engineering laboratory Paul Volckov noted that these categories suffer very actively from cocaine.
In adults who attend school, the number of contacts is maximum.

Immunologists have given rise to hypotheses, why people with cancer become victims of cocaine
The authors of the work studied the liver tissue left from the bacterial operations and found that living cells known as hypotheses could be affected by the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the live tissue also affected the macrophages, showing a strong explosive reaction.
Scientists have also studied the living tissue of patients who died from cocaine and have discovered parts of the cancer virus in the liver, including various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be placed in a live tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid the immune system's response.
It's probably also possible to do that. SARS-CoV-2.
Biologists discussed the reasons for dementia
The biological science candidate Seman Golosheykin called for dementia and discussed her prevention methods in the Sputnik radio interview.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and with the time of work, even in a known situation.
Voucheikin noted that dementia is often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
This includes hypertonia, diabetes, increased cholesterol, vomiting, depression, and alcoholism.
At the ethical level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activities will be possible," he said.
Dementation is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low - cost lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted that the inability to concentrate and reduce the level of abstract thinking had been forgotten.
"It is known that loss of hearing may be an early occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, as well as one of the risk factors of its occurrence," added biologist.
In order to prevent the occurrence of WHO disease, it is recommended to maintain the necessary level of physiological care, to train cognitive skills and skills that require memory and logic.

Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally exported from the country of artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to the family of some 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally exported from the country by way of counter-arming.
On Saturday, 11 December, Al-Hayat, Chief Inspector of the Department of Returns of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancients of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Guaad, announced this.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to return 29 300 artifacts.
Only this year in the Museum of the Bible in Washington, 5300 memories of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered," he said.
Abdele Gauad explained that all the artifacts exported were recorded in the archives.
The Department's staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "follow auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that cultural values were restored when returned and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was discovered in Belgium by an ancient human skeleton, which is now part of the exhibition of the Egyptian National Museum of Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities called on Interpol to help find a auction in London's Pharaoh Tutanhamon.
The auction house Christie's on July 4 was sold at a price of over $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This led to a lack of satisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that in the 1970s, art was illegally exported from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamon, depicted as the god of the sun, was kept in a private collection and was not placed on the market since 1985.
What a relic in Europe, it's not known.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively restored to the country ' s illegal repatriation in various times of old-fashioned memory.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the ancient civilizations are the result of the archaeological search for black hunters.

FT: Credit Suisse wants access to staff's personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The fact that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide its staff with corporate communications devices, rather than offering a call for a mobile phone or a smartphone to be purchased by a telecom operator.
Under the existing rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued by its staff, as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank is entitled to check mobile devices in extreme cases, for example, if the staff member used it to conduct a meeting with a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have gone through a remote working mode, the bank wishes to extend this rule to all the devices used to address the work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's leadership has set a deadline for the appointment of staff members with a new rule.
The information on the new requirement is not officially provided in the Credit Suisse.

Part 4
Last year of life, Sergei Essenina - 1925 - was a fruit of creation, but more difficult for the Earth being a poet and his "ego".
He's already been out of any literary associations, he's been exposed to imagination, he's on his own, but he's known, exhausted, time-bound by critics, even bad, but the reading audience's ready to put him on his hands.
A year ago, more than 60 recordings were written, many of them being the current headquarters, completed by the Persidy Motivation Cycle, written by Anna Sneigin, issued 8 books, a collection of Russian Soviet.
The main success was that at the end of June 25, Gosidda concluded with the Essenian Treaty on its 3rd rounds.
None of the modern Sergeus Alexander's poets had such respect, he was the first!
Moreover, it has earned very good money - by the way, it has made 1000 rubles a month (the director of the profession, for example, received 300 rubs a month, engineer 200).
The funds in that year were needed as never before.
Essen, who was married to the daughter of Liva Tolstoy Tolstoy, had to have a family home, had to have Sister Katu and Sasha, as well as his mother.
Life would have been a pleasure, but it would have been especially valuable in the dark tones, i.e. the treasure from the Black Man (written in November 1925 and already published after Essena's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the wind moving?
Over it is an empty field,
As I grew up in September,
It's an alcoholic.
Many prominent individuals have noted that Essenin is very generous and looks bad, apparently ill.
It's becoming more and more of a headache, a nervous breakdown.
And the reason, probably, is not just in alcoholism...
In addition, if such a diagnosis is an alcoholic, Sergei Aleksandrovic, and someone else, there is no reliable document left.
As related to May 1923, when Essen, a fourth woman, was born in the United States of America, was treated in a clinic under Paris by Professor Peter Hannushkin (also known as Essenin two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence that the poet, the scandals on this island, the police's overloaded by ten memorials.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the horror of the poet with the green snake has developed rapidly.
By the end of 1923, Essenin had recently moved to a friend of Ivan Starzev.
Surprisingly, but in Essena’s very poor income, he never lived in Moscow or in Peter, turned to dry rooms, in hotels, or in prominent ones.
The elderly remember:
"He only had to sleep, and in most cases he was in an unusual, drinking state.
Once, coming back at four o'clock in the morning, Essen fell into the woods...
I fell, I cut my face off, and I grabbed it.
When he came in a little bit, he began to scream constantly, pouring all the simple blood...
Yes, even after the war on Europe and the United States (then a dry law was passed, but Duncan accepted a similar stock of spirit) admitted:
"I didn't see anything in there except the cats and the street...
I've stopped remembering...
Well, and drink, of course...
And I drank because the roof was hot."

Matras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy is a modern implementation of the budget model in the premium class line.
The base of the matrix is a block of independent double-distance Duet.
Within a large tube, a softer tube of small size is inserted.
This allows the load to be distributed equally on matras.
With two sides of matras complemented with an artificial latex.
It's a natural latex, but it's more flat and less expensive.
The density and complexity of the material increases the comfort effect of the matrix.
The artificial latex is hypoallenic, it doesn't inject dust and dust.
Matras will have a great deal of money with a big difference in weight (about 30 kilograms).
Because of the "smooth" thing, there's no wind here when a light partner jumps on the side of the heavy.
It's a nice, soft-to-sharp chair from the practical sympathy of Sense.
Natural tissue does not absorb static electricity.
It is possible to produce this model of matrix in a rounded variant (vacuum roll).
Now my son is almost 16, and he's been out of his mind for a long time.
All energy is focused on choosing what it will earn for itself.
He's much more responsible than I was in his year or my husband, who had a problem with the law for a period of time before the wedding.
The father will take care of his young daughter.
And he likes, as Lermont wrote, "extraordinary love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam when she didn't miss him yet?
Why didn't he tell the girls that it wasn't school?
Well, she's gonna have a headache.
Well, what?
I'm moving.
Millions of students know that.

MID Poland considers Belarus to use migrants as "arms" against the EU
MID Poland believes that Belarus is using migrants as "arms"
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Yablonski, expressed the view that President Alexander Lucasenko used refugees as "arms" against the European Union and intended to return to that "operation next year".
The relevant statement of the MDG agreement was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to the Jablonian, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily "remained Lukaschenko", but he "is actively seeking new ways."
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As wrote on the kp.ru website, the former European Union introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It was destroyed by 17 natural persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a call for readiness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk placed a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

In September at the top of the film "Don't Time to Die" he appeared in a barhatic little girl and a traditional "bond" grandmother.
Following his example, Prince William, who had begun the award ceremony at The Earthshot Prize, followed by a green barhatic pedagogue that did not match the Royal Variety's Royal Press Code, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was on him and Lionel the Messiah.
The footballist came to pick up the seventh Red sword in the Dolce & Gabbana Barhet pit.
His sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for male male platoons in Russia.
According to the service analysts at the Gaziet.Ru, they started buying them at 1.4 times.
The most popular hot barhathes with a plate and a silhouette, the main colors are dark, dark, dark and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubs, which men prefer to buy exclusively peachs - the set of barathe costumes they choose.
You can buy them not only in online ritelers.
The budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the segments of the peachs from the bar at this season are presented practically in all brands -- and Brioni, Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, which went up to one of the presidents of the "Dom Gucci" brand Ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing the pajamas of the road markers can be sure that the barbarges are made of steel.
They are made up of a flat fabric with a source of external texture and a smooth internal surface, thanks to their special respiration technology.
More budget options are made from a boy or a polyamide, but, accordingly, less.
The fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Wakhishkin warns that in the case of a barached pike, it is not his model or fashion, but its convenience.
"Barhet demands a night's light, so such a pike is ideal if you've gathered for dinner or a funeral," explains Wahoškin.
Another important criterion that allows for the selection of a barhoat chicken is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a barhoat piyaga, first of all, must have a right-made pair with enough, - the authors of the Telegram canal on the male fashion "Brammel's "Bramelle" - the owners of the barhaat piyajajas, usually belong to the box of people who often buy tickets.
They are simply invited to dedicated world activities, where they are always indicated by the pressure code.
Ilia Wahoškin offers to gather a peach from the bar with the same stuff: classic blokes with arrows, single-tonnes, yellow gloves, kittens, bells.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The fashion experts from Brammel's Corps are convinced that it would be inappropriate to reveal in the barhact of a member of the corporation, and here is what is meant by “the manager of those who conduct this event, yes” to him.
If the employee is below and his aim is to move more into the company's complex hierarchy or steal the financial bonus, then the best baroque bird will not be expected.
This guide is precisely the phrase "not by the Sink hat," - the editors of the Telegram-Canal on the male fashion.
There's a lot of feelings from the voice.
It's a natural temperature, so we're tired.

It's all about money -- alternative energy is well-looped, it's about to be paid.
Billions of investments.
Did they print it?
No, the price of electricity has grown.
Traditional energy is also not in the supply of gas, oil, and coal, which is now being sold.

As usual, a few buyers.
Do the Indians have any problems with the sheriff?
Western policies should therefore not be regarded as idiots who are “lost” of the energy crisis.
They did their job.
It's too bad.
He didn't see any beautiful man on the pictures in the article.
It's just averages within the medium-statistic passengers.
It may be that if such personnel are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, they will not sit down at all.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such beautyists, but not because of their outward appearance.

Immunologists said that a 4-5-month revaccination would help to protect from the strain of the coroner virus " micron "
Revaccination over four to five months may protect from the new strain of the cornea virus infection "micron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Crouchkov, who called the appellate six months ago, taking into account the appearance of a new stamp, "for a long time."
"In the past, this period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases - four," said the expert, calling in parallel with the usual campaign to rehabilitate.
Crücks also noted that the revaccination rate provides a good titre of neutralising antibodies.
"If a man has had two strokes and a booster, or if he has been vaccinated or vaccinated or has been vaccinated, he's got a "hybrid immunity", it's an antithesis that's very neutral enough," the expert explained.
The Great Semmer warned Russia of the "great consequences" in the event of entry into Ukraine
The Parties to the Great Semerca (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) made a statement following the meeting of the head of the MDG in Liverpool.
It stressed that Russia ' s military aggression against Ukraine "will have significant consequences and will be affected by debt" in Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the increase in the military power of Russia and the aggression of Ukraine,” said.
The Ministers further call on Russia to "scathe, use diplomatic channels and fulfil its international obligations with regard to the transparency of military activities", as President of the United States Byden spoke in a video interview with President RF Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the normative format for the full implementation of the Ministries Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the Foreign Ministers of the Great Semerica also said.
Any use of force to change the border is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have a huge impact and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the limited position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response," also said.
Earlier, the head of British diplomat Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia was subjected to “severe consequences” in the event of invasion of Ukraine.

Pfizer vaccines were reduced to 32 times less effective than micron strain
The effectiveness of vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech against the cancer strain is 32 times lower than other types of disease.
Scholars from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have thus concluded that South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was less effective on the basis of a study of anti-virus activity in citizens receiving two doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
"We see that most people had a high level of anti-virus activity against the Sars-CoV-2, but this capacity was significantly reduced against microns," said Professor Malik Perris.
In this context, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable means of protecting against serious disease in the event of cancer.
The previous studies of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have prognosisd the development of cancer pandemics, taking into account its impact on micro-smokers.
The authors of the study concluded that micro-smokers could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if they did not take additional measures.
Ukraine's Head of Mission accused the FRG of blocking NATO arms supply in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, charged the Government of the former FRG Angel Merkel with blocking the acquisition of the Kiev deadly weapon within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times of 12 December, Reznikov recalled that in the past month Germany had imposed a wind on the purchase of Ukrainian anti-dumping systems and windows for the injury of non-smokers.
It is noted, however, that Berlin has subsequently reduced its position on wines, recognizing them as non-mortem weapons.
According to the Minister for Defence, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned arms under bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, it concerns the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Mr. Olaf Scholtz ' s Chancellor on the authorisation of arms delivery in Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier in the resurrection, Ambassador Ukraine in Germany, Andrey Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for the arms supply from Berlin at the Scholtz Chancellor.
According to him, the former leadership of the FRG justified its refusal to give arms to the risk of the development of the military cyclone of the conflict in Donbass, despite the “occupation of Russia” of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same “illegal” position, a certain diplomat, will be maintained by Germany at the new end.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev was looking forward to Berlin's rescue of the sea fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany "will become a technical partner in Ukraine," the president added.
It was also noted that, last year, the co-chair of the Greens Party, FRG Robert Habeck, visited the Republic, where he spoke about the sale of armed weapons to Kiev.

Open-ended ways of returning stolen money through the Internet
There are several ways to recover money stolen from the Internet and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in the absence of the RBC.
In order to reduce the risk of significant losses in the case of a bank card falling into the hands of the offenders, it is recommended that the principal funds be stored on a card or bank account that is not used online.
Part of the collection can be returned to the storage account and determined as necessary.
Experts are also recommending that a separate purchase card be placed on the network.
If money has been stolen at purchases in non-use of 3D Secure protection technology, the return procedure can be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules established by payment systems, on unauthorized transactions without using 3D Secure, the responsibility of the participant is to a set of accounts that does not use this service,” the representative of Promvezbank explained.
An expert from the international payer, Ecompey Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to make a statement to the bank on the dispute of the Mosan operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
Moreover, if the offender has used a card on online resources that does not require dual-factorial authorization, the transaction may be cancelled and the money returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, Internet stores themselves return the client's funds if the order has not yet been delivered.
On 19 November, the Director of Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber, reported that only 11 thousand cases of fraud were received in 2021: from the sale of separate documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in current circumstances could be the establishment of a single window for online complaints.
Scholz came to Poland to discuss North Stream-2 and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with the migrants at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the development of Russian troops at the Ukraine border and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline North.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain a good relationship between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations for each other.
Prime Minister of Poland, Matheus Morawecki, said he would call on Scholz to speak against the North Stream-2, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany in the context of Ukraine.
According to Moravia, Russia can use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to halt the flow of migrants trying to escape in Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for differences.
The European Court of Justice deplores Poland, stating that the judicial reforms carried out by the legal party "Right and justice" violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay taxes, and its Supreme Court decided that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, brought to an agreement in the middle, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not assume public obligations to halt the work of the North Stream-2 in the event of Russia ' s invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told the members of the Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany of the cease-fired gas supply when Russia entered Ukraine, a high-level staff member of the United States Congress reported on Tuesday.
The German officials did not confirm this message, but Scholz in the middle warned of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's borders, and this position was confirmed by the representatives of the Great Seed in the resurrection.

Our money in the church wall is worth $20,000.
Santechnique, who found money in the church wall in Texas, U.S.A., pays a prize.
This is reported in the press release of the Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Ostin preached, promising that God - fearing Christians would be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, Senator Justin Coulley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packages with money and waiting.
He turned to the church and, as he said, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," he quotes KPRC-TV.
In all, the finding was related to the theft that occurred in the Lakwood church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 was lost in cash and $400,000 in cash, which were stored in the church safe.
The money was secured, so the church did not lose.
However, information on the offenders was declared a compensation amounting to $25,000.
Justin Coulley could not claim this amount because the time of the award has already expired.
In spite of this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, who in turn contributed $5,000 to the award and later received another $20,000 in a donation from the Leukwood Church, decided to pay the fine of a senator.
He'll get $20,000.
It was reported earlier that the police had asked the pastor of Joel Austin about the money found in the church wall of Lakewood.
Tanya, her statements, her actions, and that's her "how real" character.
That's why it's so negative.
And it's not that she's financially rich, as it says here.
There are people and rich, but they don't all lead themselves as hard as this lady.

“The situation is even more serious if, in view of the fact that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, Precranial and Carnival Celebrations, as well as other activities that require a rise in turpods,” Barroso noted.
In the past, the authorities of Brazil had been obliged to comply with the 5-day quarantine.
COVID-19-opened full protection scheme
The surgeon, a doctor of medical science, who was responsible for the science of Russia, Anatoly Altstein, in the absence of Ura.ru, has opened up a scheme for full protection against coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved by introducing injections and using the nasal vaccine.
The large number of immunoglobulins A is used for international use. This does not occur when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulins A protect the fluid gland, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
And within the vaccine we have more immunoglobulin G (antithel).
And if you take both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's still no solution for double vaccination," said the doctor.
The chief profilactologist of URFO, doctor of medical science Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of the use of nasal vaccination in conjunction with the injection is to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that, in such a case, the protection of the body is likely to be maximum.
Former Minister for Health of the Negerod area, David Melik Gusyenneno, said that the new pandemic of COVID-19 would lead to the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
According to him, this picture is seen in other countries where the regular wave of pandemics has occurred earlier.

Mass protests against vaccines are not being stopped in Europe
More than a thousand demonstrators entered the streets of Vienna's Austrian capital.
They expressed a lack of the limited measures and plans of the authorities to do vaccination from the mandatory code.
Since February of the year, people who do not have access to pay taxes are required to pay a fine of EUR 3600.
Spain's health policies have made a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some people kept their hands on the inscription "This is a fake pandemic," "I'm not going to be vaccinated."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, California.
A self-certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, the home of the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
The decision to introduce health passports has been taken by a number of regional authorities on the basis of an increase in the number of cases of Coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifests protested the enforcement of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The operation began peacefully, but then it grew up in contact with guards.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers applied the instructions.

WHO has already found "micron" in six decades
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the micron virus had already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new stamp may have disastrous consequences.
The STD reported on the spread of the stomach.
According to the organization on 9 December, 63 countries had already been identified in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has become active since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rates of spread of the new version of coroner virus.
WHO experts are afraid that a new strain on preliminary data could be spread to the extent of the "delta" strain, the same Indian version of the corona virus that is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Earlier, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebreius, stated that micro-smokers could have a significant impact on the progress of the cancer pandemic.
Similar conclusions were reached in Britain.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that in the coming months, the "micron" will dry "delt".
The number of patients in Britain alone is about 1 million, which is currently officially “micron” in the Kingdom and is estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the microns, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital every day.
The British health system will not be able to deal with.
The situation is complicated that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the micron strain is 32 times below the remaining types of disease.
The reaction to the "micron" of the Russian "Sputnik V" is still unknown - it will be understood in the next few weeks.
The Gamalaya Center was just beginning to test the Russian vaccine on the micron.

The Russians warned of a new moustache scheme
Criminals have started looking for new manoeuvres for harassment in videotapes.
That's what "News" says with reference to experts.
According to the director of the product company Ividion Zaura Abbotalimova, the main risk associated with the dissemination of video media is fraud.
In this case, the flyers have created a fake video on the basis of actual records of the victim ' s participation.
This makes it possible for the neuroscientists to re-examine the characteristics of someone else's behavior.
Abbotalim added that using a device, criminals can call a known video victim or create a role to play with a copy of the human being to transmit it to the security officer.
"These transactions can only provoke bulling, as the underprivileged criminal can place people in poor, dangerous or compromising psychiatric scenarios," said the expert.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Wetcoll, in turn, noted that psychological people more trust others when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technology.

Dr. Paulova told me about the "migrant of the Day" in the workplace
Several factors may lead to feelings of guilt in the background
The reason for the loss of self-consciousness after working hours is often “the migration of the day of departure”, said a well-known physician, a medical scientist, an senior medical professional at the University of Fundamental Medicine of IGU, a researcher at the Zuhra Paulov System Medical Clinic in his telegram channel.

The UAR scientists reported the low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "micron"
In UAR, Pfizer vaccinated anti-micron vaccines have been reported to be low.
The scientists of the South African Republic studied and reported the low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccines against the micro-organism coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the micron neutralization threshold) is consistent with the effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5 per cent against the infection with symptoms, therefore... the ability to protect the vaccine against the infection is suspected, as stated in a study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In this regard, experts have explained that preparation can save lives from serious illness.
Previously in London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it had been predicted that microns of corn virus could call in Britain a new wave of pandemics with more frequent hospitalizations than last year.
How many hidden sugars in traditional products?
Sahar is not the best source of nutrients.
His rash may lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as to heart disease and oncological diseases.
The users should take into account that a hidden sugar may be indicated under unknown terms in the product ' s composition, a similar calorie sugar, composition and a glycemic index.
A number of dozens of names can be presented on the label, in fact, marked by sugar.
One of the most widely distributed and frequently met names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other dry sugars such as dextroses (cooked sugar), levolas (fruit sugar), melancholys (black path), acid acids, etc.
These are all simple hydrocarbons that are related to mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in condicators, but also in cathium, in the doctor’s cobalt, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use targeted and unprocessed products as well as to pay attention to the label and to many different names of sugar.
The variety of sugars varies according to taste, but as the ingredient in the product is called syrup or nitrate, processed or unprocessed, raw or white, it remains the sugar.
The exact amount of sugar should not be taken into account, as it is necessary to take into account not only the quantity of sugar specified by the packaging manufacturer, but also that the fruit, fruit, etc. contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total number of sugars can be significantly higher than the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas loses importance for FRG 25 years ago
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz stated that the import of gas had lost its importance for Germany, as the country continued to move towards decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, by 2045, Germany plans to completely withdraw from gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"It will be over 25 years of peace that the issue of gas transport in the FRG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continued to remain committed to transporting Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource is now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement in which support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine was strengthened.
Former head of the IMD, Annalen Berbok, said that the process of certification of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline continued.
According to the Minister, the Coalition Negotiations and the Coalition Treaty had stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
Diplomatic also indicated that the pipeline was still "not in compliance with the provisions" of the Euro-Union.

Hackers violated Twitter Prime Minister India
Hackers violated the Twitter account of Prime Minister India Narendry Modi.
Criminals have been able to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had recognized the battle as a legal means of payment and that the country had already purchased the cryptowave.
The Modi office requested that new communications be ignored.
The Prime Minister's representatives said that they reacted quickly to Twitter - access to the account was restored.
The Prime Minister of India had already arrived in 2020 and had called for donations to the fund with the help of the cryptowave.
At the New Caledonia referendum, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on 12 December, on Monday, most New Caledonians voted in favour of a referendum against their territory ' s independence.
At this level, the third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France was 3.51 per cent (2,755), while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
Javka accounted for 43.90 per cent, and more than 80,000 New Caledonians participated in the elections.
As the Inter-Agency Agency France-Presse commented, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt”, as independent parties called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As a referendum initiative, they argued against its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago would be accompanied by a full and "true" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation opened the way to the third victory of the parties to the French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, between 2020 and 53.3 per cent.
As said by the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and oppose them in the United Nations.
As reported on the resurrection, on 12 December, in the Elizabeth Court, French President Emmanuel Macron had to make a statement on the outcome of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has been very active in the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates in the presidential elections were encouraged to remain in France, as is “the last region of the presence of the European Union in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must be obliged to remain French," repeated Eric Zemour several times.
The same statement was made by the Republicans of Valerie Pekres, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, inviting the Caledonians to remain in France.
On the other hand, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the president added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Kastex, by his side, expressed "a strong desire that the elections of the Caledonians be chosen by France."

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
The Wall Street Journal was critical of Professor Christopher Hartwell's article in which he described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West Bank would bring Ukraine to Russia's victim.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger arising from Moscow and allowed a number of disturbing statements to the address of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Ukraine will start producing new generation of active non-polluteries
At the new Ukrainian-Turkey station, active non-pilot aircraft (BPLA) of the type ANKA are being created.
On 11 December, the Chief Adviser of the Ukrainian President, Alexei Arestovic, was informed.
That's how they can act against air objects, against other non-aircrafts.
Even anti-aircraft pilots.
They'll have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish plane: corpus and the like," says his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA equipment, Arestovic said that it was a matter of reactive, not of former BPLAs.
According to him, it is a new generation of non-smokers after Bayraktar, who exceed it “by all characteristics”.
The first BPLA party should be produced by the holding at the end of the following year, Arestovic concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a non-polluterary was conducted by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The creation of the Ukrainian General headquarters has been secreting data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin rockets during the military operations of the combined forces in Danube.
On 6 December, President Vladimir Zelenski informed the country that the construction of a workshop for the construction of modern warheads was under way.
According to him, Ukraine is intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian mines concluded an agreement on the construction of the Kiev Centre to train staff as well as the testing and service of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The Press Office of the Ukrainian Leader called this memorandum “a greater real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport
In the Singapore airport, Changi escaped the lions.
The Streets Times reports about this.
Two hunters were able to choose from a container with a family of lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the escaped lions is on the edge of a container.
The animals were unable to leave it because of a number of protective networks.
The opposition ended after arriving at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which was known to all Singaporen zoos.
They traveled by train with truckers and planned to deliver them to the quarantine facility.
Previously, it was reported that in Pimpene, the capital of Cambodia, the lion had fled from the village and had spread out on the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast returned home voluntarily, without harming the people.
Specialists warned about the threat of cancer caused by vitamin B9
Studies show that vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express edition warned of this.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, particularly colorectal.
However, the increase in the dose required to counter increases the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Diethologist Bet Kitchun advises to monitor the amount of follicle oxygen consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per volume.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it is significantly eliminated from this figure in the larger or smaller part.
Chitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the recommendation of the doctor, to monitor the dose and to avoid infants with milk and other foods containing folic acid.
In the past, Dr. Rachel Fein called a folic acid that slows aging.
Since she, among other things, is a avocado, Fein recommended that men over 50 years later have this fruit.
In Britain, by April, about 75,000 people could die from micron-stam.
The estimates of British scientists show that due to the spread of coroner virus micron strains in the next five months in England, up to 75 thousand people may die if they do not exceed the limits of the virus.
In this regard, The Guardian reported on the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which was transmitted by the TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of a scientific advisory group on emergency situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand summer expenses due to mycturnal pressure will be reimbursed and approximately 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, more than 2 000 infected people will be admitted every day.
"The serious measures to combat cancer may be required to prevent the overload of the National Health Service, if microns appear more vulnerable than the alternative to delinquency, and active vaccines cannot eliminate injuries," said the mathematician Rosan Barnard of LSHTM.
The Agency for the Safety of Health of Great Britain had previously reported that if the rate of micro-smoker distribution remained at the current level, approximately 1 million injuries would be detected by the end of the year.
By the middle of December, micron can become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, in Britain, there have been 1898 cases of mycron stammosis of coronavirus, 633 of which have been identified for the last few decades.
At the same time, on 9 December, British Prime Minister Sadid Javi pointed out that the figure could already reach 10,000.
She wanted to write some wise comments, but she read here before this place:
“Probably resulting from the inalienable suffering of an unhappy animal and its work in second place.”
And it's fallen under the table!
It's got "unhappy animal" it's a man, and I thought it was gone!

Question of Surviving Growth in the World at Four
Construction is over this year, and the orders for the next year are in the world, despite the call for a reduction in carbon footprint and combating climate change.
In the world register of vessels, the number of vessels occupied was 1,200, four times more than in the past year.
In the fight against the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to point out that the number of people in which there is a wish and money at a floating rate of $50 million will not be reduced, says the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more numerous.
In this year, 25 per cent of the ships were ordered more than in the past.
Brokers say the market was not 20 years old.
The first reason is that many who can afford to own a boat are afraid of injuries on dry land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the corona virus.
If all these people went to the office and met with business partners personally, most of them are now working far away, and negotiations are under way.
Broker Will Cristy told the newspaper that the vampires took orders for the 2025s and later.
This means that the bidders are willing to pay more, only their jackets would be ready for a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the richest can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the conduct of the rich and call it a decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in the absence of travel in space, the lives of horses or airplanes on their own planes call for a breakdown in society, as the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with all the rest of mankind.
The economists call upon Governments to act and propose to introduce new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they realize that, with this mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of ordered super-heats is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels 27 have a length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Recke runs a long REV Ocean 183 meters long.
After the water falls, it will be the biggest ice in the world.
The lake has a sunbed, as well as a underwater boat designed to study marine deeps.
The existing super-heaths have become a standard platform for helicopters, cinematographs under open sky, and some of them, such as the MacGregor fighter, a platform for unity.The professor of economic anthropology at the American University of India Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas elections, the carbon sequence produced by super-rich, is insignificant.
But it has a symbolic significance if it is taken into account that there are about 2,000 people in the world who are multibillionaires.
This is just another example of the abuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions of billions of billion dollars per thousand times the average population of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutants on the planet in Romania Abramovic will be responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases falling in the atmosphere in 2018.
At that time, two thirds of the mission track was mounted on his Eclipse bridge, 162.5 feet [162.5 m] long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to destroy the planet.
The owner may call the captain and give the command to take a boat from the Mediterranean Sea, for example, to the Caribbean.
The superiors do not express the feelings of others when they, like the richest Australian woman Gina Rainhard, are complaining about the Yutub, that there is no place for their giant ships to speak.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a marina for ships less than 50 feet [50 m].
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to bone marrow cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
That's what the Daily Express issue says.
Experts have concluded that the use of four and more alcohol drinks per week is linked to increased risk of oncology.
In this context, the risk of disease development is increased by an increase in the amount of alcohol used.
Moreover, men with moderate drinking risk of developing lung cancer above women.
The correct reason for the development of such anecology is that scientists cannot determine, noting that certain factors lead to a loss to the body of the process.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the age of two
Many, and more specifically all lovers of dogs are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't even know how many fourths of them are actually developing.
Over the years, biologists have experimented with various experiments to find out how an animal’s brain develops.
Although the vocabulary of the dog is not as extensive as human, a new study shows that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Scientificalert.
Dogs can't play in chess or make strings, they don't mean anything in politics, economics and art, and they often get rid of their owners.
The representatives of some communities, the experts believe, have better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are still insufficient.
Yes, some species are traditionally thought to be strange genes, for example, labs.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that they are not allowed to teach a child for two years.

Ukraine was ready for the US and Russia trade
The United States and Russia will "trading" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, said an analysis by Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the edition "Glavred".
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the United States guarantee that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite American leader Joe Baiden's words on the right to enter countries “as appropriate”.
If you are offered something that is unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be able to trade but simply send an offer.
And with respect to Ukraine, trade is on the table," an analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia plans not to attack Ukraine but to engage in dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparation is carried out in secret, fast and fast, but do not wait until the group finds out and spreads the forces of opposition," he noted.
China stimulates the development of rail transport industries
Traditional Chinese technologies drew the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries to China's 2021 international exhibition of rail transport and equipment, which was held in the city of Chuzhjou province of Huanë/Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., enable travel to automatically detect and diagnose technical irregularities, noted the representative of Hou Jjavan.
High speed travel on the China-Laos railway line, which was launched at the beginning of this month, has already been provided with data technology, which will ensure the reliability and functionality of the movement.
In the past six months China has significantly increased the exports of rail vehicles and many Asian and European countries have become witness to China's speed.
In May of this year, with the production line of CCRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd produced the first two-wheeled electricity routes intended for exports to Europe.
With the maximum working speed of 200 kilometres, these trips will take a course on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of a metro trip developed by an advanced company for Turkey began.
The trip will take place along the route of the Metropolis, which connects Istanbul airport to the city.
The move on this line will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest route to Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers an hour.
"The Chinese rail transport equipment industry is one of the highest innovation and most powerful international innovation competitiveness industries," said Fen Yaoyan, head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-class equipment production on the world market," said Fan Yaoyan.
After more than 60 years of forced work, conducting several independent studies and development, China has established a system for the production of railway equipment, with a full support package and with a large range of production activities.
According to Fen Yaoşan, the country has taken the first place on rail electricity and on the exploitation of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologists listed earlier dementia signs
The candidate for the biological sciences of Seman Golosheykin, in the discussion with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of a future dementia could be forgetful, as well as a number of deaths of cognitive violations, such as incompatibility to concentration, planning, and reduction of abstract thinking.
The discussion is currently under way that the loss of hearing may have been an early occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, as well as one of the risk factors of its occurrence, said a specialist.
Voucheikin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolisms, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the brain components are the most common causes of this syndrome.
Biologists have noted that doctors today do not know the effective methods of dementia treatment.
It is therefore necessary to take time to prevent it.
He said that reducing the risk of dementia development would help to learn foreign languages and the active community.
WHO also recommends that a moderate level of physical load be maintained, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbys that require intensive memory and thinking logic
"There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still discussed in the scientific community," said Goloshikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbys that require intensive memory and thinking logic,” said Goloshiykin.
The former dementia research organization in Great Britain stated that disease is increasingly affecting people under the age of 40.
The doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as a problem with the patient's ability to identify objects.
Another sign of developing weakness was called aphasia, a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he is trying to say.
Nevirologists needed to send Saakakvili to treatment for foreigners
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakakawvili, who needed psychological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told neurologist Otar Toid, who was part of the doctor's council established by the Georgian Ombudsman.
Its [Sakwakhvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, nature change," said the expert, noting that this is not outside the regulatory framework and that the ex-President must now be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychological rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," said Toida, requiring Saakawvili to be treated in a special facility that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December Saakakvili began to seek medical assistance after his prison staff had punished him with disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian policy was soon able to remove punishment and restore itself to previous rights.

In Barcelona, the COVID passport has become mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, the homes of the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
Many manifests have come to action without a mask.
They accused the state of tatolitarianism on their complaints and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, the vaccination passport is also required for admission to entertainment facilities and for the return of more than 50 persons.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship and called the vaccine an experiment.
Since the beginning of the pandemic in Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of cancer have been reported, more than 88 thousand patients have died.

Strong ground: How the Chinese become mountainguests
The Olympics should attract millions of people and assist in the creation of international courses in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to sport in winter, which will enable the President-in-Office of the United States to collect 1 trillion of June, but also contribute to the economic development of the remaining provinces.
The Taivu Gorno-Court in Janzjako, located near the Black Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, mining is done: the workers are cut down by trees.
There are more than 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are important enough to accept international warming.
In many regions of China, there are snow problems, including in Xanzaki.
The main goal for a long-term perspective is to ensure a comfortable and interesting return on Chinese courses so that all news can become permanent.
But it's still far away.
In 2007 the Chinese lying industry changed from the last visit to the organization of the Gamer Justin Downs.
More and more Chinese are being sent every year to the castles.
Fiona, a son of a pike, one of them.
Despite major changes, it is believed that it will take many more years to create a mountain culture here.
Many courses are located in agricultural and mountainous areas.
These regions are still developing actively and creating the necessary infrastructure for recovery.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Cunley, just away from the Black Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a train trip from Beijing to Cunley took place, and none of the locals are suffering without work.
The country is opening up more and more shops dealing with clothing and skiing for winter sports.
On the stairs, the tops of the hall are opened with the clouds of the national kitchen.
In Taiwan, there is even a test station at COVID-19.
China is trying to create a prosperous sports industry, its sportsmen must be leaders of major international events, and the courses and equipment - reaching the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty due to the pandemic of the Coronavirus, which has hampered mankind's progress in universal access to health services, have been made available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In view of the noted International Day of 12 December, two complementary reports were published by WHO and WB on WHO health services.
They found that the pandemic had led to the decline in the provision of health services, causing excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, the first 10 years had reduced the immunization population, increased the mortality of tuberculosis and malaria.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it was more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
More than 500 million people are "in extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their quarters".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrich stated that the pandemic of corn virus had put more than 100 million people in poverty and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan Minister turned off the transfer to the "Democratic Summits" at the request of the White House
The statement by Taiwan's digital technology Minister Audrey Tan at the panel discussion during the United States Summit for Democracy was translated into a non-videod mode, showing the YouTube summit record.
Reuters, referring to sources, claims that the picture was denied at the request of the White House.
According to their report, Taiwan had a map on which a separate color was assigned to the NRC, which was considered to be the island of its territory.
The map, which Mrs. Tan showed, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ransackled by the countries of the world to ensure civil rights.
Taiwan was given green as a "free" and the CDR, the CDR, Laos and Vietnam is beautiful as a "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, a picture was replaced by a summary with a note that the participants ' views "are not obliged to express the position of the Government of the United States.
The NRC was not invited to the Democratic Summit.
Reuters's source notes that the map shown by the Taiwanese Minister could be in line with the policy of "one China", which is held by Washington.
One source of the agency stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the National Security Council was angry with the Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan to a separate country.
The Washington Summit on Democracy has been held from 9 to 10 December with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia wasn't invited at the summit.
During the Nobel Peace Prize, during the “noble-day” summit, the chief editor of the New Journal, Dmitry Muratov, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be spent on charity.
Earlier today, the Under-Secretary-General of the Soviet Union, Mr. R. Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit had “an anti-rocist and anti-citic charge”.

China enhances prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemics in cities where suspicious missed points are located
A joint mechanism for prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC has issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemics in cities where suspects are located to prevent further outbreaks from abroad.
According to the circular, persons leaving these cities must provide a negative result of the test on carbon dioxide COVID-19 obtained for 48 hours prior to departure.
Those arriving in the city where the suspecting crossing points are located must at least have at least one test on the COVID-19 carbon dioxide.
The document states that these requirements will take place from the date on which the relevant provincial administrative units will determine and publish the areas of these cities by 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that the cities in which subsidised crossing points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

Another important quality of Blans Foam is its orthopaedicity: material sustains the right human situation for the entire period of sleep.
Thanks to the pine matras, the sensitivity is below the average level, so the product is considered to be soft enough.
SuperSprings is the main soft block in the matrix.

IMD spoke of "failure" in relations between Russia and the United States
The media of Russia, Sergei Ribkov, in the "News" interview, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction led to a punitive conclusion, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is a similar negative predictability, and there are some prospects for improvement of relations that we are not fully predictable.
This is a painful conclusion as a result of the long journey that we have left with the current administration, with the Trip and with Obama.
Problems didn't start yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Rhabkova, the problems associated with the desire of the United States to impose many issues on Russia.
The MDGs added that they would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improved relations and would not expect changes in Washington ' s position.
He explained that progress was not observed except in such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to be responsible for international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and Americans are listening to health considerations.
Former head of the Russian media, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with American blogger Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warned of the risk of vaccination with COVID-nasal medicinal product outside the hospital
CoVID-19 vaccines may have allergy and medical assistance, so the first items should not be organised at airports and commercial centres.
This was reported by TASS viruslogist, member of RAN Correspondent, biotechnology, microbiology and virus at the University of Novosibir State Sergei Netsov.
Organise vaccination sites in airports and commercial centres more easily, but I would do so for the first time only in medical institutions.
The fact that an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is likely to occur is minor but it is desirable that a person then sit with the doctor’s office.
The doctor has a special collection of anti-allergic preparations that operate literally in two minutes, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
In the view of the virus, it is possible to think about vaccination in commercial centres when experience in the use of the product is accumulated.
He also stressed the importance of the use of a nasal vaccine to burn on a narrow surface in the bone.
However, there is a likelihood that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the vessel is frozen after the injection.

That's what Sky News informs about.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that had introduced anti-terrorism sanctions
The Press Secretary of the President of the RF Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-terrorism sanctions in the case of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “infiltration” on the territory of the country.
"Any restriction to impose upon Russia and not to experience suffering on its own is impossible," said the official representative of Kremlin at the television station "Rossia".
Peskov says it's "meaning everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States considered the possibility of introducing anti-terrorism sanctions in the field of energy as a minimum measure.
In addition, Washington and Eurojust are planning to impose restrictions on the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank German Griff is convinced that this is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia have rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final outcome of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, most participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French Telecanal BFM.TV reported.
96.5 per cent of the votes cast were against independence.
They maintained independence from France by 351 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the Bulletin.
The vote on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the residents of the archive were present at the premises.
Experts believe that the low incidence of separatists is due to a refusal to participate in the referendum because of the Corona virus.
Paris refused to transfer the date to the referendum.
In October 2020, the inhabitants of New Caledonia at the referendum expressed opposition to the independence of France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
The majority of the residents supported the discovery of an archipelago in France.
The New Caledonia is almost 20,000 miles [20 km] from mother France.
In 1853 France declared New Caledonia to be its ruler.
Some 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is dedicated to a special administrative and territorial status.
The 1998 Agreement between Paris and the Administration of New Caledonia provides for the region to hold a vote on its independence twice in two years.

The WHO considers that the micron is less dangerous than the Delta.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that the micron is less dangerous than the root virus.
However, there is evidence of a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine in the treatment of the new COVID-19 option.
According to information dated 9 December, "micron" was registered in 63 countries.
“Preventional data and a significantly altered protein protein profile of the micron allows for a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the variant.
The preliminary findings from the UAR suggest that it (the weight of disease, etc.) may be less difficult than in the case of part, says the WHO technical communication.
The organization notes that until all recorded cases of "micron" damage in the EU are mild or unsympathetic.
However, a new stamp, based on preliminary data, is distributed faster.
Two cases of micro-smoker damage have been recorded in Russia.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for the Green
The ex-deputate of the Supreme Council of Vadim Deniseenko listed four developments for President Vladima Zelenski in 2022.
In his view, the head of the State may remain without the support of the West and may also go to the Danube compromises.
On December 12th, Denisenko told us about this in a publication at the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Deniseenko called the ideal storm, suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on a future country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that may confront Kiev in 2023.
" Parallelly, there is a reduction in prices for key goods that we traditionally export " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to Deniseenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast is based on high global concern that the Ukrainian authorities are facing a number of challenges.
As a result of such a situation, Ukraine's leadership could come to compromises on Donbassa, which could result in an internal conflict.
At the end of the summer, the probability of such a situation, according to the former nurse, was reduced to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option for the development of the situation in the Ukrainian policy is the opposition of the Green Group and the President, which is likely to capture control over the force block and the implementation of the “popular initiatives”.
During such a crisis, Zelenski's "reforming authority" will begin, Deniseenko added.
Another scenario is the conversion of Green to "the father of the nation".
This could lead to an event that would be a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to call on external partners and to increase Ukraine's support," Deniseenko said.
Such a change in situation may result from natural disaster, technical disaster or Russia ' s aggressive actions, he considered ex-deputate.
At the same time, the Russian side has no longer denied any possibility of an attack on Ukraine.
In Moscow, the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States have noted that military activity is increasing at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, the survey of the Group of Sociologists, Retting, showed that the rating of the Ukrainian President had fallen to a record of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of the Head of State.
The analysts predicted the situation in which, in the case of the next presidential election of Ukraine for the Greens, 21.8% would vote, while Peter Poroschenko, President of the country, was 14.5 per cent.
In addition, only 19.3 per cent of the President ' s alleged support was expressed.

The prisoner who was arrested for action on the Red Square said, "They give the Evtushenko 10th of the morning, here she is, the power of the posse!"
At the beginning of the week, a 21-year-old poet, Alexander Wolchenkov, was arrested on 10 a.m.
The WWE student was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which a break of #poetrosis is written.
This quote is attributed to the writer Evgen Evtuschenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the reunification of public action was established in Alexandria.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January at the Pushkin Square, at the Miting in support of Alexe Naval.
“The goal was to focus on the post office in general, now to her, unfortunately, to the collapse of a culture common in Russia, and also to encourage strangers to write their notes on the Internet,” explains Alexander.
We have been in touch with young people in order to clarify the conditions of detention and to expand its mission to a more detailed extent.
How did police officers treat you this time and earlier when you were arrested?
What were they asking in the department, how did they comment on your action?
At this time, staff members were more accurate, maximum-sustained, as if it were not funny in some context of the word.
At the Pushkin bear, the OMONEs took a heavy load.
They asked standard questions about motives.
When they heard it, in principle they saw it as if it were not acceptable.
Except for all four sides of the prisoner, it was quite correct, but I knew what was going on.
And if after actions under this heading they start writing their words, even though a few people, I'm not going to wake up these 10ths.
Max, according to the protocol, you can talk at least in the language of the Tamba-Umba.
However, public and official activities speak the language of the environment so that everyone can understand what took place in Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in the native language of the translator.
It's a protocol and nothing more, though, but Angela Merkel speaks pretty Russian, and yet he's getting help from the translator.
There are also official activities on the subject of authorship, and the stenographer is not obliged to know a number of languages.

In 2015, right-wing owners of the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of 100 major pirate sites and most of them ended their existence, says the director of the Institute of Internet Research, Karen Kazaryan.
But some of them - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have been able to survive, including the regular change in the domain name, adds.

In Kinogo, which is also available for the search, you can see the animation newspaper Encanto, but, in video quality, it is the so-called screen (recorded in the film's pirate copy).
Filmix, which can also be found through research, is available from the "Univer. 10 years ago" TNT TV series (entered into the "Gazprom-media").

Estonian scholars will be looking for life in Venezuela
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research agencies and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venezuela to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on the "Actual Camera " resurrection.
The goal of five years of missions is to assess the adaptability of Venezuela's forests, and then search for life there.
For the project, the academics proposed instruments for the measurement of acidity and oxygen content in the area of Venezuela.
So far, it has been assumed that the surface of Venus, which is close to the Earth, is too acidic to sustain life there, but it is likely that Venus was a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, there must be a test with Venezuela.
We assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks earthly or different.
If so, it would be obvious that earthly life did not begin on earth.
If there is a difference, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," told the Estonian team leader of the Venus Life Finder project, Michael Paussalu.

Metallised change in Russian business
The topic of the metallics became popular this year when Mark Cuckerberg announced that he was turning Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this has become an important signal: the major game has confirmed the development of a new form of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as in the world, will invest in the creation of their own metals and their subsequent monetaryization.
The metallics should be considered as the continuation of the existing trends objectively.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions under the pandemic is that people are free from communication and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is the result of the business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models under them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend in the numbering of assets when any rights, valuable books, art production and even money are transferred into digital format.

The British economist couldn't predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he felt that such attempts would be counterproductive.
He wrote in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be half-predictability and any trend may change the course.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of cancer virus, and secondly, inflation is believed to be.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether it was an increase in prices for temporary goods or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the peace of the everlasting generosity of central banks has already prevailed" and that it is time to return to relationships where inflation rates will be adjusted with expected growth rates.
O'Neill noted that, in the background of the pandemic, the continuation of a super-economic policy could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
The former head of the Global Investment Open-up Research Division, Michael Shulgin, reported that the positive expectations for the 2022 dollar course remained, with the potential for growth will be less significant.
Among the risks for the course of the Shuligin, he called the FRS monetary-credit policy, oil price dynamics and the threat to the background of the Coronavirus pandemic.

Russia has allocated around 4.5% of GDP to car dealers in the country
As a result of 10 months of 2021, Russian Automotive Market Research (NAAPI) was purchased for new cars by 2 trillion 784 billion rubles, which is 28 per cent more than in the same period last year.
To understand the scale, for example, the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and economies during the Korean virus pandemic.
At a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount would be compared to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (WFP) for 2020.
The Russian market is headed by the Korean brand Kia.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to drive 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
The family brand Kia Hyundai has an even greater growth rate than 35 per cent, and the output from the car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the average car price - a year in Hyundai, it grew by nearly 21 per cent, up to 1.94 million rubles - was the strongest dynamic of travel only in Changan, Cherry, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales in the Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Autoproducers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia has achieved 9.4 per cent more in the same period than in the previous year.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
Three sales leaders in Japan's Toyota, who spent 10 months in this brand, spent 275.5 billion rubles on their cars, which amounted to 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
According to the Japanese, Mercedes-Benz, with an indicator of 266,1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) - the German premium and sales volume (37 per cent) and the average car price (from 28 per cent to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz observes at the same time the good growth in sales and the medium-sized price - more than BMW - and more economic growth from here and beyond - has been explained by Napi-Tajan Arabia.
As the sales increased, Fantastic indicators demonstrated Chinese brands, as well as significantly increased financial efficiency in this year."
The Russian Lada, on the dynamic growth of income, shows average rates (over 28 per cent) and spent 10 months on the car with 229.4 billion rubles.
At the level of the previous year, there are companies that sold cars in stock in 2021: in particular Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
WAZ and all in a minute - 10 months of growth spent 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
On the basis of the problems with the supply of automobiles and the overproduction of global automobiles, auto companies continue to adjust prices continuously, the same AutoVAZ has increased the value of Lada seven times a year, the last trip (of 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
Prices for their production and other car manufacturers are regularly re-registered.
The amount of Russia's car market in cash will be increased - in addition to the failure of the car to contribute to inflation, and the attempt of the car-conquerors to play past losses is considered by experts.
In the context of the car deficit, I believe that many car manufacturers have even been able to transfer part of the cost to the user of previous periods, which they could not invest in car prices earlier,
"VTB Capital" is an analysis of Vladimir Bespalov.
I believe that, in the financial context, car manufacturers are now very well able to support the high margin of sales."
The indirect indicator is the rate of growth of car prices observed during 2021, and the price of new vehicles increases rapidly, explains the expert.
In the long term, the market will grow and in quantitative terms and in cash, but mainly because of inflation and the complexity of the construction of cars itself, Bespalov predicts.
There will be limited opportunities for price increases with the growth of the proposal.
In the financial statement, the Russian authors will continue to grow and in the future year, even if the cost of the car is delayed, the car manufacturers will be able to obtain their income from the amounts, notes an independent consultant on the car promotion of Sergei Burgazliev.
In view of the increased demand and insufficient proposal, the car manufacturers are now trying to obtain the largest profit from each car sold, Burgaslev notes.
The increase in the production of machinery is not expected at least in the near future, while food is still growing in Russia and the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
On the basis of the situation on the market, the car was an evil investment facility, a year ago bought back by a car, even by escape, and now it is possible to sell at a cost of a certain value, the expert concludes.
Baiden said that the United States of America had been transferred to Ukraine in the event of Russia ' s invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American soldiers to Ukraine in the case of "incarnation" of Russia.
US President Joe Baiden made this statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question about whether the United States had given up on such an idea.
Baiden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
In doing so, he stressed that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of cyclone.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of the use of American troops in a unilateral manner to protect Ukraine is not worthy of the report.
Byeden explained that if Russia enters Ukraine, the United States will exert force in the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flag, B9 - all NATO countries with a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia - Bytention said.
Former president of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukraine.
In this connection, he indicated that Moscow saw the problem in the fight against the use of Turkey ' s drones by Turkey, as well as that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
