I'm sure that was an accident.
Life will be, of course.
Tom says he's writing nice.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom's gonna make it better.
Tom works in the market.
They're a quarter of the liner instruments.
I don't care if our team will win or not.
How far is it from here?
What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little involved.
You can't sit with me.
She continues to cry like she doesn't have time.
Did you see Tom leaving?
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they say it quickly.
She didn't even move.
What did that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
They all laughed.
It would mean if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish the job in time.
I gave them some food.
You've disappointed me.
That's not a big deal.
How much am I gonna get?
I'm scaring you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes into his head, if you talk to him in his tongue, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind the rope.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarckastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on his business trip.
I still can't remember where I left my keys.
Where'd you get that scar?
I wouldn't think of her look, but the story of a kid who ate two cakes is from her childhood.
I can't live such a life.
Tom's hungry like a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everyone's paying.
Oktopod Paul was right.
He likes football.
What are you doing down here?
I'm not ready yet.
Are you gonna stop breakfast in the morning?
The Norwegian diplomat was hostile to the Soviet Union, so the KGB launched a compromise action against that Norwegian girl and was asked to leave the country immediately.

Didn't you do enough?
I'll take care of Tom.
Don't draw attention.
Do you think games and learning are related?
I think that's totally funny.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's your car last year?
Account, please.
Check that the cat is out and that the door is locked when you leave.
It remains to see if I can get there in time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom was nervous about getting his fingers on the table.
You look pretty bad tonight...
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like instrument music.
You should thank Tom for the letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.
We have one victim.
You should let me in.
The eternal snow doesn't look that long.
They're not mine.
What I saw was overwhelming.

Tom got away.
These monks live in the monastery.
I don't believe in historical people.
Even a major detective like Tom can't handle all the problems without helping a colleague and a colleague.
How can I protect myself?
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem.
We need to rest, Tom.
Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Forget I said that.
I didn't make it.
Tom wants to work at the same hospital where Mary works.
I'd like to be rich like Tom.
Another store will soon open up in Boston.
I was shocked.
Tom's welcome.
Tom told me this morning he and Mary went to Boston.
Can you save me a couple of cookies?
I'm allergic to milk.
Do you know what this phrase means?
I ate the chocolate box.
Tom's a real driver.
Eat the soup while it's hot.
I won't let this happen.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I let that go?
Mary can't bear Tom's boss because he's a man of the Scottish swine.
I was everywhere in Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
The minions are back in fashion.
Thank you for being honest.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I'm doing.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I don't have any ideas about him as a musician.
Tom's shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everyone's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where did she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.
They have improved security procedures and are now better prepared than before.
It's empty.
Honestly, I'm not sure I'm right.
Don't fight.

Take care of yourself.

I can't hold on.
Her boyfriend didn't provide support.
Music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call you.
The girl let the bird out of the cage.
Does one of your friends play guitar?
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of snakes.
That might not be easy.
Why is car painting so interesting?
I put every test.
I'm sorry about your smile.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll see.
Now she's very busy.
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kelly Minn since June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed last night without crying teeth.
It's dangerous to be on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're going to be unscathed.
Is it necessary to make so much noise?
You never give me anything to do.
Tom was a year old.
Come run with me.
He's driving faster.
You're a big help, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You need to write a new one.
You can't escape from the past.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tom's keeping it to himself.
I hope I find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what happened.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
The dog house is new.
I got an e-mail written in French yesterday.
Why are you so paranoid?
He's the father of a human being.
Tom passed through his hair.
I wrote some songs last week.
What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They'll be OK.
The family had dinner in the afternoon.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
I'll clean my room.
Tom and I are not friends.
I don't see who it is.
Don't stand up.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Her hands were cold like ice.
One day it'll be mine.
Tom refused to go to bed.
It turned out it was true.
Everything you remember can help.
You'll get to know each other.
Don't stop.
Tom managed to get away right on time.
I like to watch you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very nice.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really glad I'm here.
I can't answer your question with any security.
God save me!
None of us saw Tom doing this.
Let's talk about possibilities.
I was just going to suggest you do it.
She decided to go and study in the U.S.
It was really inspiring.
Tom has three grown sons.
Take my card.
You still want this?
Well, what are we gonna do?
This is my third marriage.
The next time, it'll certainly be better.
The text is very prepared.
We're all trying to win.
Check around.
This box is almost empty.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Nothing can stop us.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
I could come with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Joe's brothers?
Have fun as long as you can.
Is that love?
Today the ship was above the Mediterranean Grebena - a mountain wedding located on the bottom of the ocean, at a depth of up to 1,500 feet [4,500 m].
Yes, I love it!
It was a little uncomfortable.
Do you have a case?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament has been released.
I hope that's not true.
Have you finished yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and came out of the window.
It was something that led to the dawn of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's hard.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She was attractive.
It's getting dark.
We better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought some black shoes.
I wasn't worried about that.

Don't laugh.
Did you tell Tom this?
You're gonna ruin it if you keep playing games.
I'm the groundman.
I can read different languages, but I don't speak anyone.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things will happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
I'll need time to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We're not gonna get involved.
You're right down there.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened them.
Go right.
It's just a move.
A lot of things are going well for me.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'll leave school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The rise between my house and your house is two kilometers.
Just waste your time.
That's a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
It doesn't work too much!
I'm proud of this team.
He's hurrying.
Try this.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is there any of this really?
What are you gonna do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have any paper I can write about?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better not to eat after seven nights.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like to sleep on the soft bed.
Stay positive.
It's all right with my ear.
I just want to get home.
You were right to take care of yourself.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Tom lives in the city center.
Don't be a dragon.
Now things are much different.
I'm very interested.
Tom got a cab to the hospital.
I really like your music.
There's no business here.
Can you please tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm excited about this.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
You're infected.
We need your help.
Is Tom aware?
Tofu's going well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Don't rain me.
She's pretty like her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
He's not standing.
A lot more, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for an increase, but he changed his mind.
Come in.
You won!
That's what both of them like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I always say that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of the movement of continents because it was so difficult to imagine that the movements of the panels were at all possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you say to Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them just as much food as they need each day.
Tom's gonna change.
I've been giving up my instincts.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't cry.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you throw photos on Jutjub?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply hurt.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you completely recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It smells like a fall.
Tom's sick today.
That's what they both like.
Is it dangerous when the melanoma spread?
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
Tom almost caught it.
They're the ones who want to leave.
The teacher explained to us what the psalmist meant.
What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Come in.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful to you.
You got everything wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's having a bad time.
Start counting.
You can't ever come back.
He's a man of blood and meat with all his men.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He ended up in jail.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom saved the money so he could go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think, what does this phrase mean?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I see your card?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man goes before a woman, it's called a favor, and if she's promoted, before a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would've stayed.
Tom got really sick.
Are you sure this thing's safe?
I've come for you.
That's what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Close that dirty mouth.
Show me the document.
I still mourn the death of my oldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you coming back now?
He must be over sixty years old.
Did you eat anything?
I was already there.
I've never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.
I agree with what you wrote.
Tell me what this is.
I'm available.
We need to talk about this on our own.
I'm on Tom's side.
You've had to catch your nose a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's wedding party.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a bigger friend.
You're lying!
Even the child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a molar.
Do you understand what I mean?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Are you sure this thing's safe?
My family loved dogs.
You're right.
They can never do it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I thought you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom laughs at Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you draw your vows?
Have you ever tried?
I don't care.
Did you eat?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's that, little cat?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom was nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied up the bridge.
It worked for me.
I'm proud of you.
I'm firm against compromise.
Everything's worth it.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
Jawbreaker's round a multi-soldier bomb like a beeser.
What's your problem?
How would you feel if you left your wife?
Everybody laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's at the meeting.
Don't fight.
Just keep your eyes on Tom.
I'll get it.
I'm in better shape than you.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
That I knew at least.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I wanted to say.
I'll call her tonight.
It was a crazy year.
Move it, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom never left his house before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been one day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Let's go.
It will last for all eternity.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife isn't a sword.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Did you see Tom's room?
Let's make some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an officer of the old intelligence service that he would like to return to the old empire of that country.
Would you like some more tea?
Exer has broken the rubber.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand.
There's a lot of galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She made a vow for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than a friend.
Can you explain to me?
I bought some quids.
It's all over.
You just saved me a lot of time.
He was a dancing partner for himself.
The little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We'd better get some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear to me that he's not going to do that.
Infrared and ultrasound atmospheres are the kind of light that is invisible to human eyes.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken it off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experimental is the best teacher," they say, but on a long track, even the best teacher is tired, if he or she has too much to give in too little time.
Share the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
You really don't need to do that.
I hope it'll be too late.
Could you just leave a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind those doors.
How could I leave?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books since.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never been camping.
I'm just listening to you.
It's too late to get angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Did you stop the courts?
When he returned from his duties in Afghanistan, Tom had spent the night.
I made a decision.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't get rich.
Do you have a right?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom's suggesting to all of us could save time.
Beautiful!
Now she's busy enough.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigarette.
Tom cooks the potatoes to make a salad from the potatoes.
They're all left.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your trap, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're not right.
It's hard to get rid of long-term love from once.
Tom likes extreme sports.
A strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is the breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We must respect personal rights.
What's that thing and your right arm?
Can I call you about 2:30?
Would someone in Diznilend with me?
Why is car painting so interesting?
I don't usually write these songs.
It's really so simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you even eating?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslavian.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too boring for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
I'm gonna get you some ice cream.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're honest.
Come and play with us.
Do you know Tom ever lied?
Mary's a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom's here this morning.
Now she's pretty busy.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom was very confused.
There's been a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't get out of here.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
She's stolen a passport.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough now.
Turn around!
It took four kilograms of gold to deliver victory medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to collect numbers in his head.
Look out for me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man involved?
Do you want to talk to Tom about me?
We have to work right now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm dying.
Everybody says that.
He's talking clearly.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met that before.
Don't cry.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We're just gonna follow you.
It's hard to know yourself.
You're gonna need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You're just shot.
I've reduced my income by 10 percent.
It may be hard to get used to unknown areas.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long consideration, I finally did things.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen often?
We're down.
Can you talk to me?
Cut off the TV.
I'm flying my shirts on short arms.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom hoped he'd become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poem he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis Schalter?
Tom could tell us how to do that.
It's just that I'm on my way.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen enough now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom's gonna remember.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with it, porn will be made with it.
Canada is a country-major hockey on the ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom saved it so he could go abroad.
I don't mean to change.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt the last unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jogging every morning before breakfast.
This time he's driving into town.
I'm not happy about that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to the Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and go to school.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found stolen money.
I've never saved that before.
I got here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do that either.
How much does a beer bottle cost?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
It's too bad!
I've had enough trouble.
I've got enough space.
Don't cry.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That car's over.
Come and see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come on!
Where's my coffee?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come on.
Just slow down!
I was saying I don't know what's going on.
My friend got 95 points on the math test.
Tom didn't allow anyone else to enter the room.
Better love than power.
They're waiting for you.
There's no "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
Could that be true?
Just keep it quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some difficult decisions.
The ammonia is the base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
Nothing has been said to me.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad time stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the newspaper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the smoke.
I know, sir.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
It's just talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You got up very fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got out of the car.
I can do more things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you are.
I agreed to buy it.
Am I just going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you a sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have mixed up in your stupid business.
We worked together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
I'm all Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're freaking me out.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm a claustrophobic.
The new border to Haugesund will become the main effective route to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire western region.
You've disappointed me.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are looking for something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your years.
Tom managed to find Merin's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sport.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought it.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I heard music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be right back.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.
I like that one.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you laugh at Tom?
You have no idea how much you're right.
Tom and I were busy.
I thought you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to associate with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her girlfriends were interested in her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom went back to his room, he couldn't calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I've buried an empty cassette.
Relax, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you ever come back?
She asks how it is possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a nice one.
Look at what it is!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary's back from school crying because her friends were in touch with her.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming.
You should come home.
Alice smiles.
We can look at Tom in the suit, for a black big keyboard with dramatic movements of the finger, creating a music that is very pleasant to listen to.
Strong winds broke a lot of boundaries from the stem last night.
Shouldn't you be ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to the man's heart leads through the stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house's built by a brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't, but I don't feel partially responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of the window now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a moment.
Come in.
You really don't need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
It's necessary to be able to read notes.
Tom's dead.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Does that make you mad?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom cooks for us.
We live in the house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm here the only one who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for humans to always give priority to the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of plans for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Otupelle, homeless children can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like it to be with you.
Police work is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you add me some distance?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She's unknown. She hates others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
The Monas were able to play tennis in the monasterys.
No one believes him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might sleep.
It's changing all the time.
No one's going anywhere.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's true.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I've turned around.
I totally forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll figure something out.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think such views are crazy.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary until he was there.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom's guilty.
We need to split up.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to pass the passport.
I think Tom drew a deeper end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a lot of pain.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about a hundred books since.
Come and play with us.
And it was just with the big pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I just got 20 points on the math test.
I'm really happy I'm here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Check this out.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I used to do.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How smart!
In short, I don't agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I still get a little bit of it.
Is this your cup, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter were two generations.
He made a plan to work in the garden for two hours a day.
The apples and the crooks are cut off, not the gold and the green woods.
I'm taking my feet off.
I really like practicing.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I brought it.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're right.
Come on, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
Time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to eat?
I was thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The record of the meeting is ready.
She looks good for her years.
What's this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being judged.
I've got an appointment tonight.
Man hopes for as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
It was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a cryptographic tool.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's going to work for this.
Go see.
Some of us hate it.
"That's what happened to you." "Uh..." "Yes, do you remember the one who sent you when you asked you to take pictures of the Epplje's brother?" "Yes." And then she said to you to write down the criticism of Mek's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a criticism of Mek." "Yes." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from it?" "I realized that Philip's scarfciger was convincing, but not misleading; and that Reriti severely pays things that I think he should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I know that?
I'm going to church only out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat before you lie down to sleep.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who needs to do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He burned the ball before he went into the pit.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's the truth about what Tom's talking about.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sorry about your chest.
You're out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have fallen and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She reached her goal.
Tom can do what he likes about me.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We've been sitting together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He's never driving.
Two sides will keep the talks this week.
I plan on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you wear a beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the gypsy.
Mom just went to the store.
I'm always nervous about passive control.
It needs help.
Stay away from me.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Can you joggle?
Don't touch the lava while he's asleep.
Tom's not like that.
Could he be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
It's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's gone.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose manuscript is this?
It's a good feeling.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's eat here.
I'll find some money.
I shot the bear.
I'm sorry I'm leaving.
He's got a bird's car.
He caught fire first.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you got this wrong.
I'm trained.
We have direct access to information.
I'm punished.
The cat was lying all along the length of the sun's light that passed through the window.
Are you going to school with a dog or a bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Will I just go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't really impressed by that.
I left Tom 2013.
Maria knows that her main weapon, beautiful face and young body, passing values.
I saw the mouse.
He's trying.
Two countries have negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
Looks like they know what they're looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
It needs a dream.
I have to tell Tom that.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's not a child anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
It's my habit to do that.
I've got a knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I've reacted in an instimulating way.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked and you were naked.
She's out of my league.
What are we really looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services that pay tax.
What does the doctor think it's okay?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom did it in an old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's see it again.
It sounds like a betrayal to me.
It needs to be done.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the cover, he wrote, "Take the tops!"
You're driving slow.
What a man you are!
Twice, remember!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save a little time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why is this language? Because it is equally beautiful and stimulated by our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperato is not only useful already and easy to learn. If you learn Esperato, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could it have been Tom?
I have three beautiful grandsons.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up in heaven.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You never get to time.
It sounds like a show.
I'll try not to upset you while you study.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't be too proud.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna move on.
Tom was completely scared.
Who's this guitar?
This won't hurt anything.
We have to run.
We can't stop Tom from doing this.
I'm not selective.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You're thinking better when you're in a hurry.
Are we all here?
I'm sorry.
Tom got sick of the pain.
Everything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I brought it.
I'll sign it.
Shame on him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like scientific fantasy?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of soda juice.
That's not my job.
I've turned around.
Honestly, I don't know.
I hope it's gonna be okay.
The wind calmed down.
I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling in the bedroom.
I'd love to remember that.
Don't you dare.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The check-up festival was held in Latvia.
We're what we are.
Where'd you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're inside.
Nobody's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Hello!
Tom's gonna stay.
That guy's talking like she's grown up.
Chargers cost three dollars.
My motorcycle's new.
Tom told me he loved me today.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I send you home?
I've already tried that.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking space there.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how important it is.
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passion biker.
How did you find Tom's tomb?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's see.
I'm busy at work.
Tom's family often moved.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't yell.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom's accidentally done.
Is he a handsome Arab man or a Hindu?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's back in the race.
And I want to see the ocean.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you're hot, yell or yell.
Tom's Greek night.
He was a man who never promised to resist.
It's probably until the regular heat is shown, because flying ice from Siberia can carry polar ligaments on them.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've been having a memory problem lately.
I'm a Canadian.
I'll try.
Do I ever make a mistake?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's an official job.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget it.
I agreed to buy it.
What's the paper?
The temperature of the sun's surface is approximately 6000 °C.
He asked himself a lot of questions about Islam.
If we go right now, we're going to Boston until 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She went through her hair.
Tom works hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom's gonna say.
I'm hungry.
Don't fight.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of aging.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it gets cold.
I'm just doing my duty.
I've taken the first step.
I like to watch you play.
It's hard to take what we said into practice.
How long has your head hurt?
Ole, the oldest needle in the world, she just burned, she was about 150 years old.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a college on the top police station.
Did you see anyone there?
My father is so old that he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know that I'm painting like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had a problem dealing with that problem.
I don't know what it's not, still or just before, it was good, but more times when I tried to get on the website today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually work happily?
I went there with my will.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant that.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.
The prisoner from the prison is quickly caught again.
Everything seemed possible at that time.
I sent a map to Tom's fax.
I have a memory problem these days.
Maybe Tom won't get to a meeting.
Tom died almost the same time.
The judge's got a check.
They have also found that the same wrong estimate has been made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this will never happen again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom's been there for a couple of days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't lie.
It should be possible to change.
Does Tom have a cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended beyond the agreed period, a proportional addition shall be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let the fats go.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's saving over 80% of what he's doing.
Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
It's not true at all.
That's great!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be that way.
I'm coming when I can.
Don't get out of here.
It's not all gold.
Are we all here?
We need to focus on our roots.
How fast!
Vera can move the mountains.
I'm not giving up!
Tom fell out of the truck while he ate the eggs.
Tom became a platoon even though his parents wanted it.
I think we met before.
And I've been wrong before.
Can you tell us more?
Tom knows it's over.
It's an issue.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom drinks a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom sat on the floor under the coconut tree.
Everybody laughed.
I'm more jealous than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come and help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First.
Tom's just a lion.
I'm a little involved.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be!
Are you ready for yet?
Tom's been involved in the migrating.
Tom always smiles at me.
She rarely, maybe never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you even eating?
How strange.
Here, I'll draw a map.
Pay attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
They all ran away.
I already wrote to Tom.
Tom had to re-write the composition.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't be getting involved in your takin' business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Was I really so happy?
Tell me what this is saying.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think it's what she said was a lie?
His young brother's known as a footballer.
Saos was too busy.
I already sent him.
How does it work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
It's my job, not Tom.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's preparing meals for him.
Where did you learn English?
The beauty lies in the eyes of the observer.
How do you feel today?
That's why you need it.
Okay, what's the secret?
Are we starting soon?
Did you see me dancing?
I'm starving.
She lives in a white house.
Tom plays a very good piano.
Tom managed to escape in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You're just hit.
I'm here for you.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors need to pay for their hats and clothes.
Does he look at me?
Don't move!
For everything Tom was guilty.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan at all?
You need to be here at least once.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I thought I didn't know Tom.
I saw a Dutch horse in a zoo.
I'm thinking about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't get out tonight.
It's not easy to have a good time with Tom.
He's a man of the word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two pieces.
It's 20 now.
Did you eat something?
Have you gone to see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a glass window.
Are you ready?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't know.
It'll be better for you in a couple of days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said I'm asking you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not even angry.
Tom's a bookie.
I thought about it.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thought of being, only if we get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom wasn't right about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the real thing.
Please, write everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're growing up.
I thought you were married.
I'll find some money.
I thought you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We need to move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like to eat white wool in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Let's have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They're evacuated to an American police hospital.
We'll run to the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom isn't strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom's disappointed you.
Tom was seriously hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do this.
First he goes to 17:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was a little weird.
Does it read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
It was just an accident.
Tom never saw us.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
This usually worked.
How did you find Tom's tomb?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now the word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stand up.
It's time to go to bed.
Tom wanted to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the fun?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How do you feel?

Man has many desires that he does not really want to fulfill and would be mistakenly assumed against him.

Do you have a dog?
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Don't be a guinea pig.

Give me the number.
I can't do that either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me earlier.
Tom's got something funny about Mary, and she laughed.
Can I see your card?

You really need to relax.
What's the purpose of life?
He's driving the train.
I've had a right cheek.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little bit more slow.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a big success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
She told me one bird.
I couldn't see who it is.
It's crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It was just not our day.
Take it all.
I gave up.

Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary from that.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom doing this.
And you wonder why we can't bring up your company?

You're different.
Shame on her.
I got two cats.

His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I didn't care.

She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?

Check it out.
Tell her.
I'd like to take it.
You're my lucky one.
I'm waiting for a bus.
Bad things will happen.

Tom seemed angry.
Don't go too far.

Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried about anything.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men during one night and then killed them.
I don't do that again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
That's why I'm very uncomfortable.
Costs will grow soon.
Was I really so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.

Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, people?
Will you help me?
It's not that bad.
Tom took the chair to the neighbor's room.
I'm destroyed.
I respect such people.
Did you see it work?
Is that right or not?

A second later, his lips turned out to be a bad smile.

Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to sleep.
What am I supposed to do?
My wife's not coming.

Did I let it go?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
Little kids like everyone to pee.
She put her hair on the papillots.
He's free of military service.
My blood's on my right.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't want to get you.
Are we safe now?
Who of your friends will come?
Can you convince me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
She's from Sloan's comedian.
You told me not to lie.
He was a member of the social elite before, rather than a representative of the broad mass.
I'm scared.
Help us achieve our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.

Did you finish the court hearing?
Only I can do it here.
Tom's gonna pay.
The money season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.

I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.

This may not be enough.
That's what you did.
Everything you have one day will have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets that our email to his mother at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have any of this?
Is this your coffee?

Because of the bad weather, the plane's late.
Check them out.

Now I'm pretty happy.

Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom's been looking around.

Check everyone.
Tell us about the ghosts.
Check everyone.
The session is closed.
I've got a lot of plans for tomorrow.
We have to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
How does she look?
I'm poor.

I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student from the department.
I'm in the middle.
And if I'm rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where do I sit?" "Where do I sit?" "Where do I sit?"
Wisdom is needed to understand: music does not exist for the deaf.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis ball.
Problem kids are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I called him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's dead.
Tell him.
How do you get your ass out of the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA had a heart attack.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
She's wearing a gold chain around the door.
I'm very proud of that.
Attourk was born in 1881 in Solun.
Tom's being honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you say this to Tom?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's just five in the morning, and it's already light out.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with it will happen at that time.
Tom's good government in French.
I can't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never passed the death of his son.
I'm just doing my duty.
They're all here.
If you don't have anything else to do, then the Greek island number.
She's always wearing a dress.
Will that almost solve the thing?
Mary put a ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom worked older and older than the other boys.
It'll last forever.
The top of these mountains is leveled.
She laughed.
The gifts of the Most High are called "The Most High," and the gifts of the Most High.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown up.
I've completely lost my mind.
I've never regretted what I've done.
I'm convinced.
Are you talking Roman?
Tom came to see me yesterday at the top.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be a place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think the end is bad," he said. "Somewhere in things people really want me to see scars, failure, disorder, disorder."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I rejected Tom.
I'm not as sure as I am.
I'm probably never gonna use this anymore.
I'd buy that.
This is crossing all borders.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I should've forgotten the passport.
Tom's reading a lot.
I hope you don't talk about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not so busy on Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logical equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move.
We should learn.
We have no other choice.
When this is the time, it's best you sit home and don't go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an observation experiment, Tom couldn't describe any picture from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
That's good enough.
I definitely had luck.
They all kept their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you while you're working.
I hope we'll visit Peking too.
You're my inspiration.
I've been holding back this time from commenting on my dear friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anybody call me?
We're going to lunch together in half an hour.
I'm still a little tired.
To make it difficult to maximize its own interests, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're out of here in five minutes.
Sorry I'm late.
Translating is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything all right between us?
I've never campaigned.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We've numbered the holes on the floor that we've broken and found out he's been 30 years old.
See you later, Tom.
Do you want a fruit duus?
Let's order a meeting.
I upset him.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom's still working under pressure.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
I'm scared.
I was happy yesterday.
And I really liked Tom.
He loves ritual.
Nobody helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his mother every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
Would you like to take a walk?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of what Serbia is, with their greatest historical achievements -- half the headaches and genocides?
Do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize a brother born.
Tom lost his sense of humor.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna look.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
They're all laughing.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
You appreciate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said we'd stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can hardly speak Hindi.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I like it.
I've already written some reports.
Don't stop.
Please come and see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one died... yet.
Can we, people, break the tree and extract the nutrients from it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another cup of milk?
Congratulations!
The odds are against me.
I'll cancel.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to drink you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom saw enough.
Shall we move soon?
They're selling sugar at work.
Tom and Mary were watching the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank you for helping Tom.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
The pictures of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and peace, are the real puzzles.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mean this again.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
We have two kids.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo in half an hour.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks sweet whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom couldn't provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad nature.
I'm gone.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a lot of bad days.
The whole country's fighting about it!
I'm not a good swimr.
Do you love me?
Tom's been preparing the omelette.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm a mess.
I was happy yesterday.
In the way Mary locked the door, Tom realized that she was sad.
It's not the best moment now.
He's no longer a child.
I'm trying to spend the futon at least twice a week.
My education made me do this what I did.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join us?
Leave the book to the top police.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it on his own.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what you need?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia give up.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had a problem dealing with that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most decent person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you such information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a minute, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks tired.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logical equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came a little earlier today than usual.
I could use a horse.
I've never actually met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This has to work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where's Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them in the car on his way to work.
I have home spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
You're working slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Snoria Sturlusona’s story goes on to tell the rest that Christianity in Norway was spreading violence.
I need you to answer.
Feel like home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I got drunk.
I thought you were busy.
That elegant yellow-eyed chain with hearts is a necklace that will "swipe your world."
It all happened at a slow pace.
Do we have to tell Tom?
She fell a lot of rain.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Here you go.
You're irradiational.
I'm mad.
The holy night was in the White House.
You have to let go of me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do what it's done for the first time.
Mari jumped out of the window into the river.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm scared.
It's great.
Did you expect something else to happen?
John and Maria always walk around holding their hands.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
It's free of charge.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just putting it off.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We lost ourselves, didn't we?
We won't let you die.
Have you gone to see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a card.
Nothing happened.
I've been showing the apple pie.
He's got a good look.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth has to be said.
Look at what it is!
We have to go to the shop.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted him to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
For breakfast, I always eat fruit and vegetables.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made us know he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the quality of water be checked once a year in the pipes, twice in the bunker.
Dear God, it is really difficult for people to pay attention to one or more things about you, your attitude or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could've done better.
I'm sure you need them.
I feel like I'm thrown into a lot of trouble.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the dog they live.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary for a long time.
"Yes, I'm sorry," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I just interrupt you for a second?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's important for a good purpose.
I've been thinking about it.
Stop trying to blame me.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls slept.
I'm just looking.
Do you want to know something?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interactivity is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
Tom's seriously hurt in the accident.
Two thirds of the students were at the meeting.
My mother's not like other mothers.
He cancelled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you don't talk about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm fired.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Mary is the most popular candidate for the new leader, but Tom won't vote on these elections.
I'm sure you'll be okay to go through.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make a place.
Tom is well-known in Australia too.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother's Greek.
Be careful with your desires.
Tom's a third-year-old student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
We've never been separated.
I've got 30.
Give me my bottle.
I'm really happy I'm here.
At that time, it was exploding with a big rat.
That's exactly what I said will happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of the Norwegian population can drink water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
That's quite normal.
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?
I thought you were busy.
When he got out of the fire, he was asleep a lot.
I never thought about it.
It's a little quiet out there.
Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand.
It wouldn't like that.
I'm really glad to meet you.
Tom's been parked twice.
Good morning.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the account.
The islands are on the sea.
I've never had a problem sleeping.
I haven't seen anything.
Is there any other options?
The expenditure for the work performed and the interest on invested capital was a few million.
I can't wait tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I have to drink something.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Merino's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back later.
The sea rose, the sea people.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any passports.
It's been a long time since I sent someone a letter.
What's the difference between imitations and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom got off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Feysbuk?
Tom's working around nine hours continuously.
I hope I can.
I told you Tom was busy.
You're good.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'll get out of here.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine while I'm doing it.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking about.
It's our only hope.
I'm tired today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that was ever published.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Hold the knife.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do a test again.
Why would you give yourself to Tom?
Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me very upset.
Is there still a light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
A lot of birds are on the border.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I thought you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I'd like that to come to my mind.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
In Paris, snow falls.
I hope Tom will return safely.
Can you laugh at Tom?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's tough or fair.
Are you free today?
The three of us ate up with the potatoes salad.
Come on yourself.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lesbian.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a stripper.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became a victim of the conspiracy, he was sentenced to extradition and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
Mother chose this covenant.
We're both not as rich as we would like.
Can you let Tom know I'm back?
She did what she was told to do.
I'm a cell.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French by myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his bad point.
You're one of us.
One leg is in the grave
Tom just told me about it.
Louder!
I'm a cosy.
Tom's not satisfied.
That would be fun.
He's crazy about the power.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at least.
How old are you?
Tom asked me if I had ever slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom was a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
I'm glad.
This place seems quite different from what it was before.
Why are your ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how it works.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty big problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's the best thing to do in the walk.
This is so cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That's a lot of help.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry I was just trying.
That river looks like a lot, doesn't it?
I can keep the secret.
Tom helped me write this system.
We hate Tom.
This one's so cool.
Tom's crossed the track.
This isn't so fun.
That's a very big secret.
Mary said she'd find out the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't increase her salary.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is there anything out of this right?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a little longer.
I don't want to do that!
I'm tired of searching.
What was your day?
What am I looking for here?
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
I definitely had luck.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could be upset.
I just want to get out of here.
Don't let him get you this good chance.
Be aware.
He's in college for the first year.
I've been looking for a strawberry juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you laugh at Tom?
My accurate knowledge of the language is enough for many situations, but not to prove my, often contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the police.
I often feel a heart attack.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I got up once.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
He's a powerful man.
That's great!
I'm glamorous.
Can you get us?
Can you get in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
How can we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Was I really so happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he won't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever been punished for driving fast?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's on the floor.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
Like most eight-year-olds, Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music works for the fagot.
U.S. Secretary John Keri broke a right-wing bone in a bicyclistic accident on Sunday in France.
Where there's a lot of grandmothers, they're kids.
It sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The bones were covered.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom was very loud.
Don't move!
In the accident, he shot an observer.
Did I let it go?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
It's weird.
Florence is the best city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
There are indications that I will accept, which is known for its luxury dishes, this year to be something more modest.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom will do that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often more violent in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who's saving words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me last night.
Look at what it is!
Life's true.
You're very unsolicited.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now it's a great time to buy this one.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom was involved with people he should never have mixed with.
Tom's been visiting us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve.
I was overextending.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This has to work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's not connected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thank you for the e-mail!
I was saying I don't know what's going on.
They're gonna keep talking tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
Tim's as much as his weakest member.
I've been there already.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I wasn't having fun, so I went home early.
Now is the time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and broke a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and bitter night.
The first phase is over.
You'll be known.
He's got a lot of money, even more.
We're glad we have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most comfortable person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I've bought a toilet today.
I'm hurt.
Tom's been with us for a few days.
Does French learn in your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the press.
Tom's gonna get better.
It's important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get involved.
I used to not like anyone.
The bones are breaking.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows that he reads the song he wrote when he was 30 years old.
Did you see Tom left?
Be careful.
How would you change that?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
He's a lot surprised.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and see.
Tom really does work well.
Do your children have their rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent him.
Go blow up with Tom for a while.
It's safe.
Tom died in a dream.
A woman's schifonist is not perfect without a little black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save a diner by telling me where it could be bought.
He can't do anything but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom's gonna live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.

Life has become very hard.
Tom was my only son.
It's real.

Stop worrying so much.
It didn't matter to me.
I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
You say you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I'm not sitting on it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
Everyone says I look like Dad.
Come before we can talk about plans.
Tom, do you prefer dogs or cats more?
He looks young for his years.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
Who are you trying to deceive?

I'm gonna have to think about that.
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people in the car that I had to stand.
I don't have a home today.
Tom and Mary agree very well.
When can Tom come home?
In the window glass, I see the look of my face.
Go talk to Tom.

You could have saved me from coming just because you told me I shouldn't have been here today.
This will make it much easier for us a dog.

You'll have to ask Tom.
That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours continuously.
This is pretty cool.
How did you find out where Tom is?
Tom will probably still be angry.

I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.

Keep digging.
What are we doing here?
Tom's self-reliance was broken when the boss removed him from front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried about anything.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I'm probably not looking at this.
Come in.
Did I call you?

What should I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't keep up the same thing in the second half of the time.

Stop trying to blame me.
Pride makes it hard to become a hero, who is close to the kind of crazy.
How long will Tom endure?
The rain season begins June.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I'd like to know that I'm painting like that.

Will we see Tom again?
Let's think about the worst thing that can happen.
Walk slowly.
Let's try.
This is chaos.
My parents don't like my girlfriend, they think it's not good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning and didn't finish his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Such a situation can't tolerate things.

Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's hurrying.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't go too far.
Look at that.

I'm interested.
More loud, please.
Can you talk to Tom about me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep a few hours.
What happened?
A news satellite is a military satellite capable of monitoring many activities on the ground, listening to communication lines, recording the working frequency of radar systems...

I could've used it.
I hope I can write two or three songs during the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
It doesn't mean that it's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom will be back safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't be mad.

Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have a perfume?
Don't play monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
That's what they say. You want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we're doing.
When screaming doesn't help, raise your voice!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was being ignored.
Tom wanted to take Merin's phone number, but she refused to let him go.
I'm begging someone to do it instead of me.
You're still untested.
We'll have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Tom wore black and white shirts.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to have survived an accident.
No one I know goes out there anymore because it's a big mess.
I'm teaching Korean.
I'm lost.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of things in that store.
You're driving slow.
Tom must have had a key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you interested in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't intend to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came for that.
Tom probably hates me too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, we're dry cats, please, don't move.
Just give me a chance.
What's your mom smiling about?
How many people were there?
They're all quiet.
Follow my hat, please.
I'm worried.
I want a sword!
Don't talk.
It's amazing!
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom got into Harvard.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I don't think about it.
You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
Why don't you come back?
We've all done it.
What have you done now?
Answer me right away.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget we have to do home.
It would be nice to be waiting for me.
They sat in the circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We're on time.
Norwegian prisons are the most luxurious in the world.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
He did.
You need a hobby.
Keep working.

We need to bring another bottle of wine.
Where did you find this knife?

I'm not sure when Tom's coming.
It's not connected.
Tom used to be scared of the dog.
Finally, we have all the names of the field in Norway, and that will be of great help to our users.
Tom's gonna talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left side.
Where's the toilet?
It doesn't look like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our work much easier.
Tom was involved with people who had a very bad influence on him.
Where did I leave the keys?
I got 100 points on the math test.
Am I in love?
How do you know so much?
I'm changing myself.
It's up to you to choose.
The global network was replaced by Tom Berners Li in 1989.
Maybe Tom's gonna agree to do that.
Don't put the lactose on the table.
It's not over until it's over.
It's a big day today, son!
Tell me what you wrote.
Keep him in the eye.
Be home by half seven.
That's not all we have.
Stay where you are, Tom.
I suggest you visit the British War Museum in London.
The day he was born, he got a picture of a cat for luck with his colleagues at work.

Bring some food.
Are you free on Sunday?
That's a liar, isn't it?
Thank you!
I can't just surrender.
Do you like it or not?
Life's going on!
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I like that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel important.
Can we just get started?
Do you know what this phrase means?
Looks like he's living in Britain.
Bet-be's an Idiophony case.
You pay me well.
Tom said okay.
I don't want to discuss this now.
Tom opened a new restaurant, but he couldn't make it for him for the first 12 months.
Tom's right this time.
You're losing.
A lot of it happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I'm giving up.
What's on your mind?
I gave them a present for the anniversary.
This isn't water for drinking.
Tom showed me how to read.
Was I really so happy?
Are you kidding me?
That's how I understood.
Tom wrote several hundred articles and several books.
Come on.
What do you mean?
Tom wrote down Merin's phone number.
They're good chances we'll win.
The meeting lasted an hour.
I can swim only about three kilometers in a row.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a coward.
The beer's good.
That you've never done this before.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I'm him.

We'll live as kings.
I didn't write this.
I'm not ready to go.
You have to stay with me.
I'm glad you answered.

Tom got rid of it.
If you don't understand, you have to say that.
My parents died.
It's really nice.
I'll scream.
Don't worry.
I'm taking it!
Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach you to write.
Million depends on the conditions on the road.
Don't fight.
What did you do now?
The sun was shining, and yet it was cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom will remember.
Tom could lose himself.
He asked me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
I'm writing a terrible one.
Tom used to be a football player.
I owe you an apology.
I've upset him.
Tom's gonna go.
Tom was speaking with a strong voice.

Looks like Tom's more busy than usual.
Don't go too far.
Tom likes to thank you.
Let Tom have a party.

Would you like some tea?
What's the longest river in the world?
Just stay away from this.

I laughed.
Just give Tom a second.
I gave them a present for the anniversary.
I saw Tom play a lot of times.
Everybody tells me I'm weird.
I'll take a drinker for my bike.
I'm very proud of that.
What did you say to Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of the three defined methods to achieve optimal results.
It's encouraging news.
You shouldn't go out now, it's almost an hour.

Have you ever written a computer program?
These projects never end.
I love apples more than oranges.
There's one secret.
Could it be true?
Don't let him get in your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
What's your car year?
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry about those of you who were probably hurt; that wasn't my intention.
I told you it was going to work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.
Crimes must be punished.
Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom's doing a little bit of a good job.
I shot the bear.
I've been looking for you.
Tom's been severely beaten.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote myself.
You didn't make a serious mistake.
I don't like writing.
You ask me questions you already know the answers.
I haven't seen anything.
A few men are angry at Tom at the bar and Tom told them he wasn't afraid to face them.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
Tom couldn't produce any evidence that would support his statement.
I'm not so happy.
'Will anyone have a beer?
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
I won't say anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
How do I call the cab?
Tom signed Mary as a waiter.
Open it.
Tom's very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
I can't, neither can I.
Do you like roller?
Everything's gonna be fine at the end, if it's not okay, then it's not even the end.
Move, people.
Are you a sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Talk in your name, Tom.
We shouldn't talk to others.
Have you completely recovered?
I'm proud of it.
Where did I lock up the keys?
There is a clear difference between the best and the best.

Do I ever make a mistake?
Look at your job!

What did you conclude?
We know that's not true.
We're all going to die.
Tom has two children.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to laugh and cry.

I know I'm not perfect.
It was supposed to be like this.
Tom was upset about you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I take your dictionary?
Tom ate the whole chocolate box.
Can we do this later?
The truth has to be said.
Do you like costumes?
Didn't you do enough?
What do you know about me?
I think that's very smart.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere to talk?
Explain that in simple terms.
Tom's just coffee without coffee.
Tom pulled out a bottler.
We need to bring another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.

This is Copabacan!
I'm learning a few languages.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stay here.
Tom didn't even think he was trying to convince Mary to do that.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What have you done here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I don't fully agree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Tom says better than me.
There's nothing going on for me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my kids.
The teacher wrote something on the table, but I couldn't read it because it was too small.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll succeed.
We have enough seats for everything.
That was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Everyone can get yours.
Tom didn't let me answer Merino's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom to go to dinner.
Tom seemed to be under arrest.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
He won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Have you gone to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll go in the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking a day off.
Are you blaming me?
It's damaged the desk's layout yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Maybe I'm not sleeping tonight.
You're just wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many glasses do you have?
I've never had a problem sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Watch out!
I'm not trying to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I've been married.
Are they all strong?
Is everything solved now?
Please send me a doctor's account.
What's this about?
I want you a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Merino's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?"
That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You spyed on me.
The pen I'm writing belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary are all good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom's got a smile on his face.
I'm scared.
What's your name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area of many new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom was a little nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wallet.
It turned out I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Don't come to my girl.
I'm sorry I just tried.
I'm not even angry.
Jumi is one of my friends.
He just needed some time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Maria started to get out of here.
As far up as you can get down.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do this.
I'm serious about this.
You appreciate me.
Tom's almost never making mistakes when he writes in French.
The police didn't give up the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.

I was just thinking about you.

It's not going far from the Main Street, but you can get number 31.
It's the worst.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.

If I knew your email address, I'd write you.
Tom could beat anyone.
I'm trying as much as I can here.
I already said I don't know how it is.
The government has fallen.
Tom's got some hot wine.
This will last forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed his goal.
I totally disagree with you.
Get out of here.
Let me repeat that.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I'm working in Milan.
Come back in one day.
There was quite a different effect than intended.
I'm surprised at Tom's answer.
Everybody laughs.
I liked going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book's been sold.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I liked going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say hello.
You should have been my friend!
People need to stop hate.
I don't think he'll make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I'm not going to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother is enjoying her father's tea ceremony.
She laughed.
They're all mistaken.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.

How does that work?
We don't agree well with our neighbors.

They decided to get married.
What's Tom drinking?
Exercise has a lot to do with it.
It's about that, and it's learned to overcome.
He's trying.

It's too loud for me here.
I want to be sweet.
Tom's got a lot of German accents.

There she is.
I was saying I don't know what's going on.
Just stay with me.
I forgot to write a name on the exam.
Does Tom have a key?
Tom's ready.
You always work.
There are situations in the shahu where it is paid to sacrifice the figure to cut the advantage for a long term.
Young children should learn to cooperate with animals.
You haven't finished yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you a sarcastic?
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's on her way.
My mother likes music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Plan your home skiing.
Tom left his drinks.
I'm pretty shocked about this.
The spaghetti is empty.
Tom decided to "against."
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If you'd do that for me, you'd do a lot of good.
He was a yellow bear and a boson.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain how I get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in there, Tom?
Serve yourself.
I'm completely free of money.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a minute?
Don't let them in your head.
She cut my right hand off.
Well, now it's enough!
I'm selling coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water, and he didn't take off his clothes.
I'm a little crazy.
I'll be happy to agree.
Every bird has its own cat flying.
Do you want to see the total movement of the sun that will leave Svalbard in the dark of March 20, 2015?

What did you just write in the candle?
I know it's illegal.
I learned hard while I was in school.
They wanted to punish me.
Don't talk.
You look fat.

I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They are different like the heavens and the earth.
Tom was totally alone.
The horse's here.
They all fell asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to say anything to his parents.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I like that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Union, the largest and international, in the large Tver region, with the same size as several English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he taught him to go home on a writing machine, and he told the teacher he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm going out to eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I was playing well.
Am I safe now?
Please, write it down.
We didn't have this in the plan for you.
Tom's selling cars.
It's starting to smell.
Tom was obviously upset.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We fell in love last night.
Was I really so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I used to do.
Are you questioning me?
Tom worked his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what they both like.
There's something out there.
Police, police!
I already ordered her.
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me a lot.
What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's really a nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this movement.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in Parliament.
I want to be a swimming pool.
Do we want to see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have a lot of friends.
We don't know what's coming tomorrow.
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
I'm confused.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I don't lose hope.
I have a plan, don't worry.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us to the camp next weekend?
Have you decided what you're gonna do?
Drive carefully.
Did I ask you?
How long has Tom stayed?
People tell me things.
To hell!
Tom's in the pool.
Did Tom trust you in the story?
I was so tired that I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was walking.
I don't want anything from you.
How's it going?
Don't mess with me.
Tom's also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give you everything that wouldn't happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you interested in this?
Everyone's up.
I thought I didn't know Tom.
You can't ever be so stupid that you don't smell.
Don't move.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'm going to leave earlier today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, opportunities to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonus and promotion opportunities.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed it.
It's encouraging news.
Give me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Happy Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do that alone?
Is everything solved now?
How can it be that mathematics, which, though, is only a product of human thinking independent of experience, is so excitingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom's a real person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
It's Muriel's code.
I had my hands on the speed.
That's the risk.
His wife covered his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Get off me!
In order to change the red meat, I've been wearing a tight chest in the chest of a bakery for tonight.
I'm always angry.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just got out.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've got it.
They're not mine.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and published over the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his pain, after one night of drinking.
Why don't we just get some rest?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I'm talking about it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I'm just getting up.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom's dropped the frozen breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak fast.
It'll be half three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought some black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Cirrh is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's a very rare one.
Tom wanted to be good.
I just don't rush.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get out of here.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Are you better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passing, but beautiful memories live.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Did you repair the courts?
We fought hard.
It was a cup of tea.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time to get down through Park Street.
The police arrested him for driving in a drunk state.
We'll be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not a sword.
We hope he likes people.
We all have a price.
That gave him an idea.
I'm lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Go through any obstacles with this truck's monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and e-mails to friends.
He's always wearing dark clothes.
The luck was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men remain children for the rest of their lives.
Now we need the truth.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why are you asking?
It's big.
How fast it's too soon.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I've barely managed to hide my temper because of her attractiveness.
Butter's making milk.
We can't do anything about that.
Everything's better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss him.
