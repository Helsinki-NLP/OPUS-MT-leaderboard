Eemel Kouki led Hurrikaan's home education in opening - Savo Volley's second victory
Seven times after the man's flight from the Mestaruusliiga, Hurikaan-Loimaa started in the summer of 2018-19 when Raision Loim died on Saturday 3-0.
From Romania back in Finland, general player Eemel Kouki was 22 points more effective than Hurrikaan.
There were some offices outside, but they didn't do it, and then a call came from Loima.
It's time soon to be agreed tomorrow, Kouki said.
I also learned that Loimusa also played Tom Rumpunen's support at 18 points Koukia.
The effectiveness of the fairs was at the end of the contract at 17 points on the part of Samu Kaislasalo.
The winning of the game is always important.
Many players had an experience on the other side, and it led to extra play.
We're not ready yet, but continuing the millet is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Defining Savo Volley Effectively
Miro Amättenen was 18 points to Savo Volley's efficiency when the group lost Vieremä on Vanta Ducksin 3-0.
Our game was especially exciting at the time of the attack, but fortunately, we were able to win the victory.
At least I didn't have any information on the different charges when I played against my group, Mátanten said.
Four in the airport in the 3rd series of 2000-01, Antti Siltala started his career at 12 points.
Major Jukka Tuvinen was pleased with a lot of things.
The hall was small, but it's been dark all the time.
The good file was out of the house.
Miro was all right, Silly saved a good game, Tuvinen said.
The previous duration of the battle was 2006-07, and then he won the victory over Pielavade Samosa Tuovisen as the prime minister at the same time.
Thiago Maciel was at Ducks' 14 points.
Once again, I'm thinking of Akaka-Volley.
Since 2012-13, too much scored by Jon Mikkonen has started very hard this way.
Hackuri made 25 points when Akakaa-Volley took his remote opening at the loss of Kokkola Tiiker 3-2.
It's been a long time since I've had a good time.
Today there was a murder near because we had four times lost 17-21.
There was some confusion, and when five others came there, Mikkone said.
Some time ago, while still in the final proceedings, the most effective of the Tiikres had been the 28-point hacker of Edvarts Buivids.
Mr. Aleksandrs Kudjashaws supported 17 points.
I just can't take anything from a guy's hacker, Mike's sick.
Finland in comparison with the world's human capital
Finland is on the edge of the world in comparison with human capital, says the newsman Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
During the years, the country was compared to 195.
In both years, Finland was the only one in the statistics.
In 2016 there was almost the same rate as in 1990.
Later in Finland, there were Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland moved to a higher location and found Taiwan on a list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan entered the worst balance.
Human capital will be reviewed by the public education system, access to education boundaries, skills and health.
The World Bank has signed in connection with economic growth in human capital.
Real Madrid Thibaut Court was held in Atletico's district, the local game ended in a stateless state.
The Real Madrid painting of the Thibaut Court of Venyi, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended up unmapped after the morning of the Spanish football match.
Atletico Madrid of Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were close to the ground, but the Belgian army of the Court was opposed to the attack.
The court played in Atletico three times while Chelsea was a player.
At the beginning of the International Football League, Fifa chose him as a world leader for the year.
In the real world, Gareth Bale got the best place, but his curse was finally directed toward the end of the world's open side.
Bale left after lunch because of the more travel.
According to the ESPN, the counterfeit Realists also complained about the move to Juvents, also called Christian Ronaldo.
In the United States, we are now attacked against abortion rights - A powerful document tells us why
In the United States, the Senate was trying to find out if one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could choose President Donald Trumpin's position on the motion for a motion for a resolution by Mr Kavanaugh.
On the part of the Republican side, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice would bring to mind a decision made on the name of the Wade, which took place in the United States in April 1973.
Ricki Sternin and Annie Sundberg documentary film Reversing Roe - U.S. and the rights of abortion tell us how the current situation has been in the past few years.
As incredible as it feels, the subject is timely in Finland too.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against the safe abortion and has received special support from our country's representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has left the only abortions to be a doctor in Missouri's state for the purposes of the law.
The client's armed guards tell their defenses about the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind clinics of the killings of terrorists.
Let's move to the time when the abortion was a legal offence in the United States.
The association of the Lutheran churches was then known as the creation of abstinence doctors who trusted women.
The reasons of the question priest are good, but they don't even need them, the picture of an abortion itself is enough for the dead woman.
The deaths in the United States were about 5,000 years ago.
In particular, the Republican parties were involved in the legislation of abortions.
In 1967, Colonel Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law in California.
Later called Reagan, in the 1980 presidential election campaign, he turned his back on his belief in the opposition of political voters.
His Aborttics also surrounded his successor, George Bush.
And so did Donald Trump.
In this case, the firmer document is looking for a basis for abortion policy.
When a tax exemption was lifted from religious organizations that supported road transport, they became politically active.
They chose abortions.
The religion has brought exceptional solutions to the political situation.
In writing this, the United States is in a situation in which the voice of deep concern has been shaken, but the voice of religious justice has been raised by the President, who has chosen the highest right as a proposal for Kavanaugh, which many women now blame for sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can be given the power to determine the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israel's army shot seven Palestinians, a group of two children, with great worries.
Some 200 Palestinians have been killed in the year Israel has arrived at the border crossing.
Israel's soldiers shot seven Palestinians at the Gaza border, the Palestinian Ministry of Health tells them.
There are two children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, who are 12 and 14 years of age.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been infected.
Ninety-eight of these were infected by the species.
The army of Israel has confirmed that it opened up and made a border crossing, when the conspirators destroyed Israel’s armies with stones and with arrows.
The army is saying that when they start using force, they will not shoot or shoot at the other side of the border.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza Strip after March, when the Palestinians started to limit weekly entertainment.
The victims are 12,000 according to the United Nations Human Rights Authority.
In 1948, Palestinians were forced to enter the areas where Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established.
A Palestinian spy has killed one Israeli soldier.
Deforestation and agriculture in Israel has been the result of the explosions by the Palestinian side of the lakes and the helium bombs.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty shot - you didn't get to shoot yourself.
Wigan's superior, Chey Dunkley, looked like he was lost to him on the way back to the penal area.
Specialist Gavin Ward gave the game a move.
According to his explanation, the office was clean.
I couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation would have been difficult for Special Agent Wardy, who judged Norwich in 85 minutes when Pukki was released.
Ward seemed to be punished, and Mario Vrancic needed a 1-0-votetomate.
The ball's been made to Norwich five medals in the Navy.
The previous one was born last Saturday against the QPR with a symmetrical spinal cord.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
When the ball was lost, he went on to the end of the situation.
He read the paintings, and he walked out of the woods.
Norwich's appointment was in five weeks.
The group's going to be in the trunk.
There's a five-winning bullet behind it.
The Pedophilic Help Service was immediately filled with stock - in Finland about 40,000 experiences of interest to children
According to the estimate, at least two percent of men and a small proportion of women experience some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland this means about 40,000 people.
It has been difficult to get help from children or young people who have been sexually interested in sex.
Support for criminal care and the SeriE joint SeriE project is training professionals to meet pedophiles as a customer and helping people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced early in the morning, advice and therapy began to be provided at Sexpo’s e-mail and meetings were saved very quickly at the end of the project, Yele tells.
However, these are permitted to measure the amount of free will.
Sexual fantasies involving children lead to many embarrassment.
Most pedophile feelings have not been observed in themselves and thus have not done anything criminal.
However, the opinion is generally a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get away from thinking that grieves and humiliates them.
They also care for normal life, says Dr. Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a special expert on the project.
I think the job is valuable if one child survives sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologists?
In the United States, President Donald Trump Nobel won the prize of peace - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is, on the basis of the railways, one of the most popular prizes.
At least at the level of spaces, the role of Trump in achieving North Korea is to be committed to nuclearism.
The greatest recommendations for peace in the Nobel Peace Prize are based on reports by President Moon Jae and North Korean leader Kim Jong, who have already agreed three times this year and agreed to seek peace among their countries.
The temperature among Koreans is remarkable, since there have been hygienics in recent years.
However, in the years leading up to nuclear destruction and the Earth’s Red Cross, there is no doubt that the award of Kim would also be critical.
The Nobel Prize winnings are published from the start of the world, and as a family, the most important thing is the peace prize.
If the reward is not granted to Korean diplomats, one of the candidates is a Congolese physician, Denis Mukwege.
The estimated gynecology has kept the hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo thousands of women who have been victims of gang rape and have grown to be a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has focused his work on sexual violence, which is a powerful product of many conflicts.
A strong proposal has also been made to the United Nations refugee organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Prize winning this year has been announced by the Nobel Prize.
The names of the candidates shall not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't have been bad if Nobel had it.
In May the minister asked him in the White House if he should consider the peace agreement.
Everyone likes it, but I'd never say it myself, Trump said a chimilla.
I want to get this ready.
I would like to congratulate the whole world, but the President continued to refer to North Korea's negotiations.
There are, however, obstacles that make Trupin's Nobel Prize inconsistency.
The Norwegian Nobel laureate Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multi-ethnic world order - just international cooperation, which was seen as an opponent of Trump.
In the 2000s, three U.S. policies have been awarded, all of which have been democratic: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
The award of Trump was therefore required by the Nobel Committee for a full code of ideology.
Fire notification in hours: Cars were used as fuel and timed wrong direction
On 8 September, the traffic accident in Lohja alone occurred.
The traffic in the tunnel was interrupted because of the notification, both Turun and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system-wide problem, the company tried to make transport normal.
But it didn't work very fast.
We tried to open up the road once before, but the Railway Centre said that it could not be opened, because the road has car owners as well and they know how it is going, the day-to-day pilot Pasi Kjärien told the STT right away.
The engine was then launched at the wrong time only after a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, the traffic security liaison officer Tapio Heskanen surprises.
According to traffic rules, engines and sensors cannot be stopped for any reason.
Transport safety reminds us that in exceptional circumstances there is no risk of transport in emergency solutions.
The warning devices must always provide the best possible stopway.
On the other hand, the time-limited engine has been denied, as well as the construction of the u-turn and the re-establishment of the engine.
The same prohibitions are also valid in the sense that, in addition, there is always a link between airports.
It is also prohibited to stop without a valid cause, as is true of the suspension.
There have even been cases in which the driver has been stopped by the tunnel to drive the world.
It should be clear that this is a wrong place and time for action, Heskanen says in the Communication on Transport Safety.
Irves fans would have wanted to keep on celebrating, even if the ship remained on the other side of the sea.
The Ilves fans carrying the M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on the ship on board, even if the ship had remained on the coast, to tell the ship’s captain that Juho Sirya was operating during the event.
The M/S Tampere, on a trip to Tampere, later thought about leaving his vehicle on Saturday afternoon and stayed on the north coast of the Old Sea in Akaka.
There were 19 passengers and five members of the crew were evacuated to the harbor at night.
No one got hurt in the morning.
Irves fans would have wanted to keep on celebrating in the ship until morning, but certainly it was more reasonable to send them to the palace by the door and by the bus home, Sirya told the STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the adoption of Ilvessen and HPK, which ended in 4-3 votes.
According to the surgeon, the cold of the day led to the fact that the surface of the water in the Old Sea was about half a meter below normal.
Navigation was also difficult, according to Sirj's report, for nearly half of the marks were in the cover of the logbooks, and therefore its leaks were not normally seen in the dark.
No mention of noise
A few days after the ship was crashing between Tampere and Helsing, the ship was hit by a storm on the west side of the Rumusensalm.
The larger dramatic case was not linked to Sirj, since the ship’s speed was very low during the course of the course and did not cause the most significant disturbance.
According to the sailor, the landing on the ground has not caused shipwrecks and pressures, and the crossings of the ship are going on normally.
In the morning, the driver went to check on the ship’s crew before the ship was taken off the coast.
We're still on duty to check that there's no harm caused by this, Sirya tells us.
Sirjä believes that M/S Tampere can be treated properly for the first week of the week.
The ship's cross-section continues to reach its own date.
Not used for ambulances
The rescue facility received a warning on Saturday afternoon shortly after 20 years.
On Friday, ambulances were warned to take away unsuspected passengers, but the ambulances had no use.
The late night, Mr. Matti Willman told me that the conditions on the sea were difficult because of darkness and almost severe wind.
The rescue facility was informed by half a month later that all the crew on the ship had been evacuated and passengers have moved to Tampere by line.
In 1957, the railway train was built in the previous years of 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The Court of Justice of Trumpin, who has been charged with harassment and robbery, may be guilty of a criminal offence.
Mr Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of Justice, presented in the United States, may well remain in office for his purpose, according to programme director Mika Aalola of the External Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and abuse during school hours.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought so much political pressure on the Republican side that President Donald Trump may decide to present an official to another person.
In the United States, the President's proposal to the Supreme Court of Justice has then been seriously discriminated against.
In this case, the court case has generally been brought up, says Aalola.
The President has thus been able to maintain his growth.
Name should be added to the list of democracies
The highest right of the United States is to try to be on top of politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, a new judge's election has become politically very difficult.
If Kavanaugh is named, the decision will probably send Aaltola to the Democratic Party in the meantime.
It would increase the volume of vote among young people and women who would probably vote for democracy.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to a higher degree would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The opportunity to be named does not belong to any of the Presidents, as judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are nominated alive.
In practice, some of them have left their own application for a divorce at the age of 70 to 80 years.
Part of the Republicans are also unsure of the name
In the United States, the Supreme Court of Justice is normally informed of the fact that Aalola is true.
Although Trump has only set a week's deadline for the FBI's additional release, it can, according to Aaltola, reveal something present.
Yes, it can.
It's hard to get out of here, says Aalola.
According to the Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's compatibility or incompatibility will be discussed in an open manner before the Senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate, 51-49, but at least two female Republican senators are suspiciously named Kavanaugh.
It would be unfortunate that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would be destroyed.
A woman identified Salisbury as a military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has been told by a public radio company to recognize the horrors of Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service of the suspect.
The woman said on the basis of the photos that there is a military communication with Anatoli Tshepi, who works at GRU.
The Bellingcat network and the Russian Insider Russian community previously reported their discovery of other suspects as Tsepiga.
They had already said that they found evidence that men’s present personality is a mystery personality.
The BBC team traveled near the border between Russia and China, where Chephia was located.
The woman who lived on the street recognized the picture of young Chepigan Bellingcat.
He introduced the same man to the British police, where he was presenting himself as a man called Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russians are skeptical of the murder of former double agent Sergei Sscriptal and his daughter at the Novitshok-hermomyrk in March.
The scripters would find out in the spirit.
Everste Tshepi has been awarded in addition to the 2014 Väänkar honorary mark of Russia.
The Russians still have doubts about the GRU connection.
In September, suspected suspects told Russian TV that they were visiting Salisbury as tourists.
Old-fashioned soldiers in the Soviet Revolution
Now there is a living example of what the Government of Cyprus defines in the context of the reform of the military reform framework.
In 2016, the Vala military services are produced by Oulika, who has been elected the former Regional Director of Atendon as the Health Service.
The Heads of State shall notify the Authority of the change threshold.
If the fleets are now rising, the future of the state forces will continue.
As the mid-term decision makers progressed, most of them are also prepared for a major structural change in the population, which would end the health department's facility and the small memory unit.
In addition to home care, which means a long distance between people living in private homes, they are forced to move to the nearest "home" care centre.
It was believed that the government would pay for it.
The left-hand side of the village was not a bad preparation, but a good opportunity for the public, which became a lot of property, neighbours, and also responsible for other parties.
I presented to you on the parts of the military-country preparation, how adults are treated in the state of Valala at the present time in most of the Nordic countries.
He also had the authority of the neighboring society to take over Carina Lentin.
The local team did a great deal of good things, and it was back in Ouluka's factory in the backyard.
Sote manufacturers don't write to any paper that Attendo has built a new Vaalana nursing home, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers are only talking about services, but they do not tell you what level of treatment it receives or what staff structure Atendo needs to treat adults when it comes to treatment.
Without a nurse?
In particular, the premises of the health centre are closed so that there is no day-to-day maintenance of the doctor.
Attendo should also be provided with medical care from the Ministry of Health.
The example of the option tells us how central authorities are turning over the unauthorized information and the authorities are forced to face the wall with the counter-transitional restrictions.
Thus, the central part of the island is emptying its inhabitants because who will stay there safely to live freely if there is a chance to change.
Was there one option that the whole earth should be used?
Turkey's President Erdogan opened the Grand Duchy in Cologne.
In Germany, thousands of people in the city of Cologne have shown their mind when Turkey's visitor President Recep Tayip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
A number of hundreds of people had been gathered to the shore of Reinjo since the morning.
Erdogan is not healthy, including in the minds of the constables, and he was sentenced to fascism in school.
During the visit of Erdogan torstane, several comments have been made, and security measures have been difficult.
In the cold streets, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, inter alia, the Turkish human rights system.
Erdogan's support had also been collected to the proximity of the Grand Duchy.
However, the police had distinguished a large region from the presence of a Moscow security environment.
In his opening speech, Erdogan called for the success of its German campaign and assessed its strong relationship between Germany and Turkey.
During his voyage, Erdogan contacted the allies of Angela Merkel.
Erdogan and Merkel complained about their ongoing reconstruction of relations with countries that had suffered significantly since Turkey’s turn-in in 2016.
However, it stressed that there are serious differences between countries, including human rights issues.
Assessment of the environment
Mr. Henriette Reker and Prime Minister Armin Laschet of Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Mayor of Cologne, followed his participation in the openings when the assessment of Erdogan's visit was appreciated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told Erdogan about his visit to Switzerland.
I want to have a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and tortured.
For Erdogan, everything that excludes his own mind is terrorism.
In the last phase of the Erdogan German campaign in Nordrhein-Westfalen, a significant part of the population is Turkish.
Three charges in Slovakia on the murder of the supplier
Three people in Slovakia have been charged with the murder of Jan Kucia.
The prosecutor told the family that three people were charged with the murder of Kucia and this terrible crime as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in an investigation, but five of them were released.
The woman was found in Bratislava with her pregnant companion, who died in February.
He's been studying the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
The police are suspicious of Kucia's findings.
The slaughter and Kuciak published article has raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the area of military service in the south-eastern part of the state of emergency.
The result is also due to Sunday's arrival in Karjaline.
This may be seen in the newspaper’s distribution of emergency areas where distribution to communities is required to be made from outsiders.
The situation was similar to that of the newspaper, and the problem may continue as a country.
Posts are put on a lot of paperboards in the country.
The publications of other Finnish officials shall be sent separately to the country concerned.
The distribution of these papers will soon come to an end.
Water is a Finnish astronomer
Operator Arto Nyberg is currently in charge of the upcoming debate programme, including Vesa Heilalaa.
The water is the result of an environmental disaster in the study, which he purchased from Virginia Galactic in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which was required to pay as a bank.
If the original plans had been in place, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
However, the date of departure has expired over the years.
Now it turns out that things are in order after a failure, in 2014, after the death and death of the victim.
If it's all going well, commercial flights will still start this year or at the latest during the first year.
Water flight number is 300, that is, his trip takes place from the first departure of about a year.
The plane lasts 2.5 hours and is in a busy state for 5 minutes at 100 km high, the Finnish astronomer tells you about his coming home.
In the same way, he also finds satisfaction in the environment.
As a child, I read about the name of the Avarustaka and saw the Star Trek series on television.
The war has been seen, and that's why the idea remained...
Why not?
Everyone's got their own poison.
Manchester City was a very old man
Manchester City continued to be killed in Valioli when it disappeared on Saturday at home in Brighton's country from 2 to 0.
As a result of the sixth victory of the Governing Body, Malarias are active in the ranks of Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero.
Sterling was able to drive his four-way approach to an empty land when Leroy Sané found him at 30 minutes from Brighton's backyard.
Aguero made his own statement when he and Sterling went back to Brighton's retirement at 65th.
Argentinian was able to install 2-0-voltages for a penalty period easily.
With six victories and one level of distance, City begins driving the Valioliiga at 19 points.
However, one of the less played Liverpool, only one point at a time.
Liverpool is located on its own on the 7th floor of Chelsea.
Youngsters chose new decision makers in Joensusus
The Finnish New Yorkers elected the new decision makers for the next three-year period 2019-2021 at their Sunday meeting.
The President was elected from Anu Sivonen to the Supreme Savo and vice-president of Petra Mäkelän Hamee.
The Watch Tower Society was elected to 40 senior members and 40 members, the Finnish New Yorkers will be informed on Sunday.

Lewis Hamilton went over Kim's apartment and surprised Ferraria: "It's a very important driver"
In his interview with the Swiss President of the United Kingdom of Mersun, he was asked if the release of Kim Räikkös from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton finish.
Hamilton leads to the MM point of Ferrari's second kiss with Sebastian Vettelė at 40 points.
Less than three weeks later, Ferrari said that the Räikkönen was not going to go to court first, and the same Räikköne was informed that he had moved to Sauber.
Hamilton doesn't believe in natural sciences that the Rock would find the hooks in the sand.
I don't think Kim's going to change her mind.
He's an extraordinary professional, a fantastic driver.
He's staying with me, and I'm sure Ferrari's leaving a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously been told that the League has been one of his predecessors.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was a young man, and I played F1 player at PlayStation all day long.
I've always been Kim, which is a crazy time, Hamilton said in June.
The F1-Course will continue to be held in Russia's participation on Sunday.
At 14 o'clock, it's going to Mercedes's Valtteri Bottas.
I've been after the kiss for a while.
The battle of the A-Nuor SM was complete: the opponent reached the site with only 7 players.
The top row of the football boys ends in the evening, where they play the last round of the street.
Before the start of the 13th round, the starting points for the Mastership Competition were clear: FC Lahti Akatami has been able to adapt to the IFP in practice.
In order to turn the situation into the last circle, Ilvessen, who is second in the battle, must be able to control PK-35 and hope for the elimination of solvents.
In practice, however, the master of the lathes was assured, since Vasa IFK had reached Lathai with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer leftovers, the adoption would not have been possible.
FC Lahti Akatemia won the prize 16-0.
At the store, the lawyers led 7-0.
One reason for the poor player is that the group has played the same number of players in the A-new SM series, P20 series and the C-section of men.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkos in practice against the destruction of the entire country.
On the day of the second round of decisions, Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK's guest shop and with the same hope that Tampere Uniteds will lose their business against KuFua in the Siilinjärvälava.

Four people were involved in an accident.
Two of them were hit by lightning, the rescue device is informed.
Good luck with the report.
According to the rescue facility, the road was marked by the trails of the port.
The police party went to an accident site.
Supo expects new means of information: Device contracts and prescriptions already made, not removing from the external plan
According to Chief of Supos, Antti Pelttar, the information manual has been purchased by making equipment projects and training staff.
The budget should continue to increase by around EUR 10 million in the coming up of the information channels.
In Helsinki Ratakadu, the protection policy (supon) facilities are already fully prepared to complete the entry into force of the media.
The Head of the Society, Antti Pelttar, tells Lennen Medial that future information permits have already been made for equipment projects.
Serena Williams is surprised by the video he's singing in the upper room... campaigning for information on the race.
The tennis superstar, Serena Williams, is meeting again.
Now he campaignes to raise awareness of the ringleading by publishing an Instagram video where he sings just his hands in front of his rings, says AFP.
The hat is an Australian The Divinylss hit I Touch Myself in 1991.
The video Williams supports the operation of Australia's railway crossing.
"I dreamed of the Divines global emergency to remind women to regularly carry out self-checks of [the race]," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the midst of a misunderstanding, but I wanted to do it because it affects all women regardless of their skin color in the world.
A temporary discovery is all a and it's saving a lot of lives.
The Divinyls's second author is Chrissy Amplett, who died five years ago at the age of 53.
Music videos are part of the I Touch Myself project that has been designed to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He went out of his wheelchair, but he gave us an emergency room to remind the women to put her health on the front," says Williams.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
The video comments will show William's courage.

Would you like to go to work in a small river tomorrow?
This is the facts for and against
It's hot. It's hot.
A lot of Arpoos stay home or not.
However, the work force supports the idea of supporting others to suffer because the people may be tired, even if their symptoms are small.
In the middle of the river, the symptoms of the flu are spreading in the middle of the river.
In the next option, you may already be able to touch others, even if your symptoms are small, tell a publication of Prevention.
So do you want to stay home?
Prevention requires flow even when a person does not have any symptoms on his own.
The virus is already taking days before the infections begin and before five days of the week.
Children may be more likely to suffer from disease.
As soon as you're aware of the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when the sun wakes up and there's no more heat, says Professor Gregory Poland.
Training also supports avoiding.
Too fast to return to the island to slow down.
In addition, wash your hands, brush your teeth, and throw your hands into the hole.
But you want to move?
If you need to remove a disease from your home, consider using it.
The machine doesn't like viruses in the wrong place, but like a user, it's got to be aware of the area of the head.
At that time, no strings will be put on either the mouth or the mouth, Poland says.
The brains are also limited to the machine.
How, then, can you avoid the trappings?
The best way to continue is to wash your hands and avoid growing up.
However, it is difficult to avoid the consequences.
For example, in the United States, the average exchange rate is between the eye, the nose or the mouth between 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.

The restaurant M/S Tampere crossed the streets of the Holy Sea - "Sustained by the stone"
The inner vessel M/S Tampere was sent to the soldiers later on his family's day on the island of Akalla.
The rescue plant received a warning of the water traffic accidents on its family day after two decades.
The 30-metre M/S Tampere has been thought of by the karik, and is firmly attached to the stone on the stone, described by daily fireman Matti Willman.
The ship had 19 passengers and five men.
According to the rescue facility, personnel were avoided.
Travellers and almost all members of the crew have been evacuated from the ship.
Now they are transferred by line car to Tampere, the day-to-day chief told Jari Nieminen STTT one night later.
On Friday, ambulances were warned to take away evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship traveling to Tampere was thought to be off the coast of the island of Jumusensalme.
The police will find out the cause of the incident.
The day-to-day pilot Matti Willman told me last night that the conditions on the sea are difficult because of darkness and almost severe wind.
According to the rescue facility, the ship's court is wrong.
The ship doesn't appear to be raining.
The manufacturers shall proceed after the evacuation operation to examine the situation on the ground.
In 1957, built M/S Tampere is now an inland waterway operating as a restaurant, with a maximum allowable passenger number of 180 people.
The ship also has a meeting to be held in private.
According to the ship’s web sites, the passenger is in the past in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Staying out of fear - look at the day's events about this.
This looks like this and tomorrow's admiring.
Sunday’s darkness is on the horizon, and the hundreds of thousands of thousands of our land are forced all along, and the East Finland’s waters are spreading and becoming more sundial.
There's a lunchpot.
The daily temperatures are between +7 and +12 degrees, in the North Pole there is a higher temperature.
During the day, the south and the central part of the country will be covered by rain and may become a weak season.
There is also a wide range of clouds in the Lapis, but most of them fall.
The sun's on the north side.
The sun’s temperature varies from the previous +10 hours to the North Pole near the zero.
Ex-managers require Robert Heleneus to pay unpaid wages
The explorer Robert Heleneus's winter trip against Erka Teper saves money.
Tonight-Sanomat announced that Jaakko Helmsen and spareman Jussi Kokkila had left the challenge, where Helenuksel had a total of more than EUR 80 000 in advance of the unpaid manager’s tickets.
According to the questionnaire, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenuks 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to agree, but there's no other option.
There's been a clear performance here, and there's been a lot of work done, Kokkila says to the Night-Samom.
The current manager of Hellenium sent Markus Sundman to the night response to the incident to the sight of the hunter.
Helenus argues that he is obliged to pay the amount required.
In reply, Kokkila and Helmin had offered financial support to Helleneux and had promised to be able to arrange for his purchases and sponsorships.
It was probably agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay the wages only for the percentage of his income.
In turn, Heleneus was assured that there is no need for any payment but to receive the results of their arrangements.
This is also normal and the only use in the management of professionals.
It has never been agreed upon, and this would have been more logical in the case of Heleneus, to find out in his message.
Cooperation has never been made under a written agreement.
In reply, Helenius would have initially wished for a written profit, but Kokkila and Sundman had received the creation for the first time by the end of 2014.
He endorsed the proposal for his own sake and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helsinki.
Helenus did not take any time in his dealings with Kokkila and Helms.
After the end of the year of cooperation, Helenuks had been shown to the "individual but measuring" bill from the manager's job.
This year, your foot has been raised on the same charges.
Hellenius is considered to be a cruel act of Helmens and Kokkila, in contrast.
Helenius is today at the IBF's hard-core seven-six challenger in Erka Teper in Stuttgart.

Sari Piippo left his Urana in Brussels and went home in Finland - to think of two ideas about the series: the lack of the equipment situation did not slow down
In the past, my husband was away from a divorce where he proposed that he be a person in his own history, told an espocalypse blogger, housekeeper and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo tells us that he has been a European economic and legal translator in Brussels until ten years later, after four children, he became a refugee.
I've been home for a long time.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought what the boy would do when the little boy started to be big.
Then the 2014 picture became a series of images.
Pippo tells us that he had never dreamed of making a painting, even though he had read Ak Ankkaa, Tintti and Asterix at a small time.
I had been confined to my childhood, but when these creative works began to be born, the situation changed.
At first, I made some of the ten manuals at the party.
My daughter Vivi Valkama (s. 2000) is probably a border guard, but I didn't get her caught up in the middle of 2016 when I gave Vivia with a border guard.
In fact, he endured a series of ten times, and then he had to start trying himself, to beat Pipepo, who tells him of being a great counselor.
It's easy, and it's a handy tool to try to get something out of here.
I didn't even try to limit the paper, tell Pipepo about his relationship with the restrictions he normally celebrates at night.
I'm afraid I'm not going to do it all the time, but I don't usually do it once.
One third of the snowflakes are going on for even more hours.
I'm gonna do the painting once and for all, and I like to play with the colors.
It's always difficult to start crossing because it's not a strong line.
Sari Piippo tells of his appreciation for the current series of words, including Scott Adams' Dilberti.
The L-theme of the creative group is a young porcine mother with a salatic head.
The other people are men, Pissies and Cexos.
In the creative world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own lives and social media.
Sari Pippo does not want to preach or offer a package even though it is between the Creator and the Creator.
Pippo tells her story to her husband and to her children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at your painting and realize that I've done this today.
And the challenges are enough for the people!
Creativity series can be read on the website of Creomompa.symbloggit.com
Loto's millionaire was left behind - these were the right numbers.
No full amount was found in Lotto at 39/2018.
The biggest win in the East was seen in Launtai-Joker, which brought 20 000 euros to Vanta and Vaasaan.
The first week in Lotto's power is EUR 3.6 million.
I found two out of the quality Jokers, six of them.
Another 20 000 Euros win will travel to Vantale S-Market in Tikkuril with a live winning card.

Indonesia's landing: The airman killed himself - didn't leave a cool turn before hundreds of passengers got safe
In Indonesia, 21-year-old Air Force Commander Anthony Gunawan Agung has grown to be the ruler of the country.
Agung remained alone in the airport until hundreds of passengers were safely transported from the island by the treatment of landfill.
The young man was at the airport of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie, in the city of Pallun, when the landing took place on Friday afternoon.
On the other side of the airport, Agung refused to leave his place before he was guided by the welcome of the Batik Air travel agency.
So he could save hundreds of human beings, and the Indonesian Air Force told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie's airport on Monday after landing.
The flight attendant turned around and walked away.
In the end, Agung tried to escape by attacking the fourth round of the tower.
His leg was broken, and he got serious internal injuries.
Agung was taken to a nearby hospital.
He was able to travel by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he lost 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, and the Air Force representative told The Jakarta Post.
The sequence continued to save the plane, and the force was measured at the end of 7.5 magnitude.
She lost at least 832 people.
The Indonesian Air Administration has respected Agung’s neutrality in social media.
Rehn pointed out that Europe's conclusion to trade is: "Let's look at the next tweet"
The trade gap between the United States and China is widening across the world economy.
In all Europe, growth flows have been calculated and Finland’s Bank has gradually reduced its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said in the context of Ylen that while there is no positive impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which is reflected in company investment decisions.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
I think that Europe has a very good reputation.
It has been able to build an interface with the United States and to share the peace-building situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not think that Rehn seems to be on the feet of the merchant fleet.
You have to look at the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We've got an unexpected time with my partner in Washington, but he said on Ylen's questionnaire.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the whole Western world.
Markets reacted strongly yesterday to the Italian government's storm-to-day presentation clearly in the subsidised budget.
In the first year, more than 2.4 per cent of the population was born.
Rehn thinks the situation in Italy is a concern.
Five per cent of the country's loans are problems, and unplanned loans are more than 10 per cent.
In addition, its public economy is in bad shape, and the country again shows its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be possible to support new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would bring the new economic crisis to Europe.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be fine.
The difference would be much more negative.
Rehn started as President of the Finnish Bank in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will be responsible for the journey year.
The debate has begun with his successor.
Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikas' name has been rejected in speech.
It's no problem if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he's not going to comment on this longer.

There are still some slips in the national theatre.
The presentation of Tampere is finished.
Liput Myy Lippu.fi.
In the Middle Ages, suppliers and artists in the area have long been preparing a certificate that has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something else that nobody's ever heard from.
"I am surprised at the strongness of Helsinki at night, the impact of your report on the Earth on the other side and the story of a very timely health issue," says Esa Lija, one of the producers of the Black Table.
After the presentation, there is an opportunity to meet HS suppliers and writers and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized the evenings of life journalism for three years.
They have been at first recommended and often end-users.
Over 15,000 people have already been on the scene.
In the fourth grade, Bonnier was awarded a year's journalism.
The participants expressed their appreciation for the new way to make journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
In May 2019 the Black Paper is seen in the National Theatre in March and June.
The presentation will also visit Tampere and Turkey.
There are different content in the presentation that came to be seen in the future than in today’s novels.
The missing witness was found because of the "unprecedented trial"
The division of the Finnish police drone is a global phenomenon: "We're asking for training"
According to the police department, police can use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example in crime investigation and information purposes.
The police finally succeeded in finding a missing criminal in Raha in just a few minutes.
Dr. Kimmo Himberg of the Police Academy questioned the case and pointed out, among other things, that "we are also the world's top of the world through unhindered experience and effective education."
Drone's probably a new chapter, and it's even more new in the police department.
There are no statistics on the fact that the Finnish police would be the master of the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong view, however, that is the case.
This has been explained, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There's a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for Turkish visitors to look at the Swedish police's drone operation.
We're going to ask for training.
It's going to be all over again.
Himberg recalls that finding lost in northern Finland is as important as possible soon as possible.
As noted, the missing ones in Rahab’s case were found only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're meant to learn more.
Already, drones are being used in many police stations, and their use is increasing and increasing in the future.
That's what I'd say. Himberg tells me.
In addition to the search for missing police, Himberg may use drones, for example, in accident or crime investigation and in certain information projects.
For example, there is already a need to take a little longer to verify that there is a potential threat of violence there.
Drone can use the pre-communicator.
Karjalan Rugby grew up in the same family
Karjalan Rugby juhil Kuopios' victory for the 2nd division on Saturday.
The joens were still on the side of the 7-12th floor of Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found one in the second section and destroyed the front of the 26-12.
The master of the 2-division is exactly the same as Karjalan Rugbyll's historical growth in the 1st division.
In the past, the track has been played in the unit, but the Finnish rugby series was then divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-threaded 1 division.
Seura's going to take a seat on the beach, but it's going to know for the first time that it's going to be cold.
The current need for twenty-nine players has to get up to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer games, so the cost of the game must also be consistent with that.
Kotcaniem begins on the way to Montreal, strengthens the main authority.
In Näjekjekko NHL, Montreal Canadiens's leading governor, Claude Julien, confirmed on Twitter that the Finnish politician Jesper Kotkaniemi is starting on the way to Montreal.
Montreal owned the super-freedom of Kotkaniemen, 18, on the first round number three times in the stock market.
The attackers joined Montreal at the end of its exercise of power and have submitted strong measures in September's enforcement proceedings.
In his first operation, he was immediately able to make a day.
The director, Julien, met a Finnish senior development team after the arrival of the results.
The NHL racer starts in the first week of torture against Finland's time.
Montreal is located on the open-air tour of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
This week in Finland, there's been a lot of talk about driving.
The president of some government, Risto Siilasmaa, told HS in his interview, was writing a Paranoid Optimist in which he was responsible for leading his philosophy.
At the same time, he appreciates the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Olila.
Ollila was deeply critical of the charges, but previously the Nokia reports have discussed the inability of the leaders to act as a group; fear and incompatibility, which led to the collapse of the mobile business.
The risk-effectiveness and continuity of the company's growth phase were lost.
The week in Helsinki also organized a business-life event in Nordic Business Forum, which led to the World Trade Center in Finland.
In addition to Barack Obaman's 12 business districts, the Laval rose.
Talk about good behavior.
The leader's legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader should be confident to take the company to the future even when the company is going well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are spiritually most closely associated with the decisions of the past.
The founder of John Mackey, known as the widest natural selection, was John Mackey, said that the director should share the message with the entire staff of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely a victory for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote of the Introverts of the past book, said that the most successful leaders were under investigation.
They work peacefully, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodora of the Finance Department recalled that the good manager’s characteristics must be shared with the company’s life-cycle.
At the start of the company, the manager must share the story of the company's future.
The growing company needs a driver who knows the numbers.
These students at the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
It was dangerous for them to have a lot of information.
A good leader needs a lot.
That's why driving is so often smaller, even at the highest level.
There were also Chile and Ollila.
They were talking to each other in the middle of the street.
However, they may have wondered if they were the right leaders of Nokia at the right time.
And their humility has not been easy to evaluate.
Sara Chafak arrived at a beautiful red map directly from Los Angeles - most of the year abroad
But Sara Chafak arrived at the mystery in a beautiful black museum.
In 2012 there was also a small scale in the showcase of Miss Finland.
I'm a little bit of a podium.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I'm gonna stay there for the most part of my time, Chafak is telling me his stories.
Chafak tells you to use it in Los Angeles.
He's done the other way around.
In the United States, he describes himself as an interesting person, as well as as in Finland.
In fact, he has to do more than that, because the model works are always easy to find.
It's got to be stronger and aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreography Sonya Lindfors for 30 000 euros live art -palkinto Kuopiosa
The artist Sonya Lindfors won 30 000 euros on the day of the prize in Cyprus.
The Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art has been awarded to Lindfors works in pairs of choreography, community activity and education.

In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, there were a number of international artists.
The exhibition will be distributed annually on the field of live art to a competent, exceptional strong artist or group.
The Danish police found a big operation looking for Volvon: "We can't tell you anything"
The vast search of Danish police has produced results.
At the start of the operation, the movement was closed at the ports of Juttinrum and Ison-Belt.
All the land and coastal traffic on the island of Själlan was closed in Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
The police are looking for Russia's black Volvo V90 registration.
The IS aimed at the daily police station in Copenhagen.
Searched car has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found. Henrik Storm Köpenhamina's police report to the Night Samim.
According to Storm, the black Volvola is not a direct contact with the police.
He says the biggest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet told the police on Sunday about the information situation.
Investigative President Jørgen Bergen Skov was the cost of the vitamin surgery.
He didn't want to tell me what crime was being investigated.
But Skov said it's a "hard crime" thing.
This was a threat to the human soul.
Three people have been found in the operation.
The police don't tell us if they've been arrested.
According to the letter, the restrictions on rail transport have been lifted.
You've been following the law enforcement police on Twitter too.
According to the STT, however, the general public in general is no longer concerned, as the threat was addressed to certain people.
Macedonia's name has been causing decades of discrimination - now the people vote on the matter in the appropriate elections.
In Macedonia, in the Balkans, the most recent proposal is to be voted on by the country for a new name.
According to the agreements between Macedonia and Greece, your name should be in Macedonia.
Greece has thus been able to prevent the efforts of Macedonia from becoming a member of NATO and the EU.
According to the Greek name Macedonia, it belongs to the northern part of the country.
The question of national vote does not mention a new name, but it is clear whether voters support Macedonia's EU and NATO accession by adopting the agreement.
The vote started online at least in the capital city of Skopje, in the middle of the school.
Olivera Argirosvka, a nurse who was retired from school, hoped for the support of the contract.
The vote will mean a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change for young people, he said.
In 1991 the name of Macedonia itself was used in official relations with the Republic of Macedonia, namely the Republic of Estonia.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
The national legal opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has also been called upon to vote in favour of the people.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to increase the voting threshold by over 50 per cent.
The national vote is not binding, but the victory of the Yes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
In order to change the Constitution, there is a need for a majority of the two-thirds majority of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The vote will close at eight o'clock in Finland.
Come on!
Robert Helenius was born in Erkan Teperin.

Helenius would have decided to take the eight in one moment, when he fell to the left hand of Teper.
Teper couldn't get up on the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" was attacked by his opponent in the third one, when German swine began to bleed.
Helenus and Teper were on their first visit.

Canada is fighting time to get a match from Nafta with the United States
Time threatens the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the United States and Canada in negotiations between the United States and Canada.
The United States has set up a workshop on Sunday, and the country's negotiators have discussed clearly over the weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, held a general meeting of the United Nations in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
The United States, Canada and Mexico initiated negotiations on the requirement of President Donald Trump about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement in Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States entered into a contract with each other, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been born.
The United States and Mexico wish to enter into force the agreement before the presidential elections won by the President of Mexico, Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador, took place in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that plans to sign the agreement at the end of November were with or not in Canada.
For these periods, the text of the Agreement between the United States and Canada should be prepared in the morning so that the United States Congress will have sufficient time to assess it.

The reason for the arrest was to protect from crime and terror.
The prisoners were released after the situation had calmed down, Valentin said.
He told us about the night's events before.
The deal ended 0-0.
After the end of the trip, a large crowd of HJK's supporters were traveling to the village.
The situation led to a deterioration between the supporters of the gangs and the gangs.
In order to end the situation, it was necessary, inter alia, for railway police.
In addition to Kent, the explosion occurred in an area close to the metro station, where some of the arrests were also carried out.
I wasn't in the place, but what you're thinking about, so that's how it was supposed to be.
It is estimated that no crime has been reported as a result of the events.
The rapporteur called for the beginning of its SE era in the world, and also for the final.

Students show a rare sight: the ancient tragedy - feared Orestea affects visual vision
The dangers of anti-Trade are rare in Finnish sights.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen an ancient tragedy in Sofokleen Filokette in 1988.
Now the Theatricocortics School was brought to the National Theatre at the start of the race of the antiquated only as an example of the remaining patternology, Aishylos Oreste.
In the beginning of 2015, Lava opened!! Project Theatricocortic School shows trainers are working internationally with a professional director.
This fourth project, like the first one, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
In April, Orestea, an international prime minister, arrived in Berlin.
The Council's recommendation on the Russian Federation to strengthen the report on the completion of the Court of Justice's judgment on the destruction of the Court of Justice and the establishment of the Court of Justice for a period of twelve minutes, in particular by the extension of the customs duties.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Christ Simonsura’s wonderful presentation (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theater’s pages of presentation focus on a simple and beautiful presentation.
Its central center is the dynamics between the sun and the stars that appear on the horizon, and the dynamism between the sky.
In the present case, both two-and three-thirds of the digits are used.
The exhibitors have never been removed from the scene, so, for example, the killings of Agamemnon and this war area of Kassandra are shown by showing, as was the case in the anti-examination treaty.
The report does not suggest that it is an anti-examination tradition that it is believed to be.
Rather, the eyes of the viewer are created in a modern, faithful translation of the text, which is constantly aware of the ritualistic truth.
The rose has succeeded in becoming a solid group, a single organism, with a group of rhythms present.
In particular, in the south-easts, very expressive, well-designed group-forming systems, exhibitors are able to reach their rights in the background, only by using the white outer surface, by displaying them.
That's amazing.
I think the presentation goes on to Kouvola and Oulu's Theater.
The Korean manufacturer is preparing its first water pump
The novelty begins to appear in Europe, in particular because of the solidarity agreement with Hyinda and the Swedish H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published in Hannover IAA, Hyundai provides a thousand new models of the car to the health company and its partners.
In that market, Hyundai will continue to use a fuel fuel tank and the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as a water tank manufacturer.
In this world's first project, we will bring fuel technology to a much longer stage.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by following the development of the tank network, Hyundai Motor's security manager In Cheol Lee said in the public policy of the contract.
Several times, the yurts raced in Kayaan
A little over three-thirds of the man was a bad guy at a restaurant in central Kaaan and representing him in the morning.
The man first found one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the place.
Outside, he would work in another man's land, and in the absence of a third man, he found himself again.
The police arrested the criminal.
In the police station, a man was still aggressive and would beat the other police on his feet.
The man also threatened the police by harming and killing them.
The man was taken to peace.
Let us examine the matter in three ways, as well as in the violent response of the official.
In the middle of the night, another tragedy occurred during the morning.
I'm sorry about two men.
A 20-year-old kayanaman killed a victim.
A little later, another man killed him on the ground, and the man who had earlier beaten him was still a victim.
The outsiders dragged the criminals away from the scene, and the police were summoned to the scene.
However, the perpetrators had to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask observers to contact the Kaian police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail research.kainuu@polisis.fi.
Long line radio player Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, a long-term supplier, died at the age of 83.
Radio operator Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He went to a payroll that he told on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going now.
The doctor has also said that, once a day of life, he commented on the situation for the night months ago.
The security of the trade mark and the seat shall be ensured.
I first received a press release in 1984.
When some of these years have come to an end, it is usually about the news.
When I wrote (Kaljalineen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of the workers in the retail trade, I was shocked and even angry for a moment.
I also talked about the case of the Services Professional Union (PAM) Commissioner for the Environment, Erika Kärärä.
He's saying the criminals don't tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though the workers obviously claim to be different.
The police know that only very serious cases have been tried and that many of the right regimes remain unreported.
"Companys have the obligation to statistics closely based on their situation in the workplace, but these statistics remain in internal use and their data is not collected," he said.
They don't have any access to statistics.
In developing countries, there has always been a problem that they do not always produce physical diseases.
Psychiatric traumas can be much more serious than bruises and injuries.
There is a difficulty between the different situations of violence and the threat of violence when a certain level of aggressive threat must also be reduced to violence, even if it is not possible to use it.
Too many fear at work, even if it's not happening.
Some residents are unscathed.
The deal's got guards.
During the opening hours, there was a considerable shift in the media from its effects to the security of the sellers.
"Then in time, many workers organized security services to at least at night for feelings and to prevent work alone," Kärärä’s comment.
When nothing happens, we'll make the wrong decision.
This would seem to have a positive effect now, but this creates a new negative trend.
When alarming conditions remained in good hands, it was thought that caution would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we're trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
A good crime is a specialist, and it is very understandable that sellers should not want to make an investigation of a criminal who usually lives in the hands of a trader.
However, according to the 2011 law, the fine is reduced to a minimum if it takes place in the workplace.
I think there's a need for preliminary cases now.
When the next time I'm going to sell my dad or it's gonna hurt him, the police should investigate him and the prosecutor should apologize.
When justice was held in the prison of a few criminals and it was decided that they would be punished so severely.
A society in which food trade must be open to the local community at least once a day must ensure the safety of the workers.
Heidi Sohlberg called on the misses before the end of the call, "Sara, Iiro is married then."
I haven't seen anything like this this year on TV, but I'm sending a message to show the Viafree site.
The mission will be carried out by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasatin and Viaplain NHL and KHL students from Iiro Harjula.
Backstagen and a red man, Janni Hussi works.
Before sending directly, a delegation informed the local authorities and the media about the costs of the shipment.
At first, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjulla the hardy apples.
Now, all the women!
Now, look at this, our husband, Sohlberg failed his colleague at the general strike.
It's been following a lot more than a few more years, Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other, and Sohlberg fell on the narrow side of a small village.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg would lie down and look at Sarah.
What is more likely, Sohlberg referred to the motion to the rather ecumenical Sieppin, who made a comment, even though it seemed amazing.
Sieppe spoke for the first time in the newspaper of the Night-Samom.
The mission officer told me he didn't want to open up any more reasons in the public, because it's between him and Roope Salms.
He said he doesn't have a rush to a new relationship, but he's going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own affairs, and especially on my own life, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage union was still under way during the later period when Sohlberg started calling Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula to be a Parisian couple.
The three of us were laughing at the ball.
Iirohan was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi's gone.
The Northern Hemisphere was bound to the open area by burning, burning and burning a strong castle
On the other hand, a 34-year-old man in Kokkola has been sentenced to three years in prison for a crime that he has committed.
The crime scene included fever, headaches and nausea.
The Court ruled that the State had been deprived of those cases.
Because of France's suspicion of a lot of rape.
However, the right of appeal for this case has been denied.
For the sake of cocaine, there were four kinds of abuses, cruel torture, rape, the threat of the law, liberation, torture, and two threats.
Crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May.
As a result, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
Last week, as a torturer, the Supreme Court handed down its judgment and appointed a 34-year-old prisoner to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of pregnancy
In addition, from 34 years of age, two Turkish nationals were accused of being free of charge and two Turkish nationals were sentenced to forced labor on 22 May.
However, these charges of justice have proved to be inexhaustible.
The killing was dealt with at the back of the doors closed in court.
However, the Court ruled in a public resolution.
According to the Court of Justice, the accused had been subjected to violence, threats and rape in situations where this had been linked.
The condemned animal was burned with fire on the altar, burned with fire, and consumed a very strong jar, and poured water and water on it.
At the same time, the right of the State has appointed criminal instruments to be lost: wheat and barley, nuts, wheat, wheat and rice.
Four witnesses
According to the Court of Justice, the parties continued to communicate between actions.
Of course, most of the most serious crimes occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women, and two men were heard in court.
At 34 years of age, the victims will be paid compensation for pressure, pain, suffering, and temporary illness totalling EUR 5800.
He may feel that he has such money because the judge already has old debts in his family.
Prison sentence is not a man's first.
I don't have a name to protect the victim's privacy at night.
The recent court of appeal is not the legal authority of this writing.
Europe's four points leading to Ryder Cup solution
European golfers were imprisoned on Sunday as a result of their practice in racing against the United States.
Europe leads the player Ryder Cupia score 10-6 in Paris while still playing two games a day.
Europe won three of its four rounds on Saturdays, and the winnings in the afternoon were 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who were able to play together on Saturdays and Saturdays.
In the past, none of the European parliamentarians had been misled.
On Sunday, two of them aim for more history.
No European player has won five points together in Ryder Cup, and no American player has won more than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK renders its supporters a series of horrors in the Hokka Valley: "The Force does not belong to the football game"
HJK would publish a report on the day-to-day event in which it judges its supporters in the FC Honka district of Tapipola.
"We are sorry for what happened after the Honka-HJK operation," the report says.
By the end of the trial, about 50 HJK's supporters had turned to the country, and part seemed trying to challenge enough with Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a murder between supporters.
The prosecutions were not allowed to rest, but the police and the railway police were also required.
HJK will inform the group that the players and actors have been affected by the incident.
The following events after the adoption are usually not based on the values we observe at 111 years of age.
"We are constantly talking about all the action that threatens the safety of the event," the report says.
The HJK shall allow authorities and event organizers to help identify and remove harmful factors.
The support culture is part of the football game and the HJK is important.
We all support positive, joyful and encouraging action in football games.
"It's not part of this," the report says.
The Philippines can fly by a drone car to avoid traffic accidents.
Mendiola is a Filipino poet, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing group of people in the world who steals from their own flying car or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has, for example, such factors as Audi and Airbus.
But Mendiola doesn't believe in mass production.
According to reports from around the world, man has used much of his property to build his dream.
He started six years ago to develop his flying car.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Later on, he said he was the first successful tester on his device over seven meters high.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic accidents.
I hope that the device will trigger positive reactions.
It was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: work-related activities will take place in children’s day-care and social and health services
In the public and welfare areas of the world tomorrow, the exchanges of work and age are particularly evident in social and health services and in day care for children, JHL's president, Pajevi Niemi-Laine, assessed.
The effects will be widespread, and they will certainly be seen in a way that is not enough for the staff in place.
Everyone needs to think about how he wants his child.
The employer must now take care that the services are playing and that no one is in danger, Niemi-Laine tells the STT.
According to Niemi Laineen, there was also a decrease in the number of workers at the beginning of the year when the members of the JHL were at the time of the exchange of employment and annual contracts.
The workers have made it possible for the staff to be paid, but the workers have left over or changed the doors.
This is not a job interview yet.
There is always a standard of working order for each employee to be taken into account for regular working hours and to do so only.
JHL is responsible for the government's efforts to reduce the volume of small enterprises.
The employer's employer, Markku Jalonen, does not intend to assess the impact of excessive employment and annual exchanges.
However, he does not believe that they are very attractive, even though the services may be weak.
The workers around Finland have been aware of this and have prepared what is involved.
The area is so wide, social and health and technical sectors that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, by region and by workers, Jalonen told the STT.
Jalonen says that in the past week, experiences were already obtained, including the close and basic management of the Superintendent and the Social and Health Professional Organization of Tehran, three days of continuous action.
Their effects were short-lived.
The JHL's annual and annual exchange of work concerns, among other things, citizens, the church, the state and private social and health workers.
For example, family caregivers are confined to the outside.
At this stage, there are almost 100,000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions can last a long time.
The association has also been prepared for other employment activities if the preparation continues to take place.
The government should now admit that this is a wall and a tough one.
I'm thinking of the leg and the ay movement and the government have to come against it.
This is especially true that the bones are already in the dark, although the presentation has not yet been given, Jalonen's diary.
Great Coralism is produced by the power of children and adults - at the summits of the exhibition, we learn about the nature of heat and ocean currents
In other rooms, the Great Corallerian collection was first held in Hampuri and the last evening it was presented in Finland the second time, this time in Canaltala.
In the way of the larger works of the group, the Great Coralism is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end in conjunction with the general public.
This time, however, there will also be a clear-cut presentation, which will sharpen and replace the findings made in the activities carried out at the beginning.
The theaters also have hundreds of seats for children.
The child’s appearance has already been taken in the manufacturing phase.
However, great Coralism is not a childish initiative but a presentation by adults and children in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and insights from the children’s custom to take knowledge from and practice art.
The ability of children to lose their ability to practice and play together also increases the gap between adults and children.
Great Coralism also reminds us of certain satellites, coastals and natural information, but ultimately it is based on other, non-human facilities around visits.
Great Coralism begins to be known by coral and coral reefs for life and fish movements.
In six different areas of the continent, we learn about the dangers of heat and ocean currents.
Finally, an hour’s presentation will be made, where music, weapons, and boring maps and woods will help you to learn the life of coral reefs.
There are people in the great Coralire, and there are people who observe the life of coral reefs and coral reefs that are being examined.
In addition, there are coral reefs.
Many of the sights and sights that have been shown in the direction of many make the appearance closer and more vivid.
There are some people in the country, the country in which they live, and the other life in which they live, or the country in which they live, and all of this at the same time.
It doesn't make any difference to children.
In other rooms, a group seeks to achieve the level of thought and action that is achieved when it is made up of children and adults.
On the other hand, the participation of children makes it more important.
After a work party, Sitratari arranges a quiet message of opinion for dangerous corals.
No matter how difficult it may be to think of the importance of exercising self - control in the pursuit of the spirit of self - sacrifice.
In other places, it has built up its work so that it also respects the diversity of life in politics.
There are other species, there are other kinds of information, other species and their future generations, whose levels are limited to the population and players.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood wasn't smart.
Today's kids and young people are more responsible than ever.
Young people start smoking and smoking all the time, younger and younger.
I think kids should be kids all the time, and don't fight for days and sex, because others say they're doing it.
I was shocked when my friend told me that she had to ask her sister in the fifth grade for a "boy cancer" trust.
When he came to ask for his sister's divorce, he told her about his sexual experiences that night.
I can't imagine my sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned all our childhood that it's not possible to date, and that sex is a matter of adults.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a healthy life, and they will not need to grow older because of the pressure of a group of friends.
I see more and more young girls in Instagram, who are depicted in their faces and reveal their clothes on their heads.
Snapchatta is used to take and send images in the evening.
It's harder for girls to think how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look 18-year-olds and their parents.
My childhood was about playing in the woods and playing games.
I'm glad my childhood wasn't an intellectual.
I've been a child for many years, and I didn't need to think about what others think of me.
Above: Officials have told the government that the case does not involve Ariston Helmi's association with national security
The defence police and defence forces, according to Ilkka Kanerva, went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been told that the study of Aristo Helme is not currently linked to national security, but to organized crime, Yle reported.
Ilkka Kanerva (kok), President of the General Defence Committee, confirmed the information of the sources that had been identified.
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and the defence police were conducting an ongoing investigation in the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee this week.
This is considered primarily economic corruption.
They must have been tired of not speculating that there would be something else here, Mr Ylen's comment on the question.
According to the above, the material nature of the safeguards has not so far been shown in connection with national security, but the investigation is contrary to the area.
We can't know anything else about what's going on out there, one of Ylen's challengers.
In the past week, large households in the island of Turun and Mantera have raised the question of whether there is only economic uncertainty or a threat to Finland's internal security.
The night before, the meeting was held this week, where complaints were made both for and against.
Video: the dream of saving Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool’s hundreds of Valioliiga’s initiative came to a conclusion, but it was still more satisfactory than a group of 1-1-tasals in Stamford Bridgel.
In the morning, it will be a good time of year for Manchester City to reach Stamford Bridge and take 1-0 visa.
And then the Pep Guardian system sent the entire Valiiliaga signal that City was now real.
Everyone remembers how the last time it ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp reached the same ideal in the West London.
The Reds had begun with the six-year-old victory of Valioliga.
Liverpool became stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk felt that he was the only one to manage his own farm.
Chelseala was a semi-weekly excellent visitor from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the alternative point of view and decided to take a course in a unique direction.
Now, of course, Hazard was right from the beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first played with Matthew Kovacic and Jorgin in a small room.
Finally, the Croatians saw Hazard’s victory ahead and sent a full-pressure to this.
Hazard thought a little bit about the punishment area, but then he bombed the perfect left side of the road to the back of the river.
Alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't get as much as he did on his back.
Klopp must have felt slightly unjust about the execution site, as soon after Antonio Rüdiger fell from Mo Salah's guide on the map.
On the second floor, too, Chelsea Vesser Kepa came to the facts.
Baskivath quickly responded to the Sadio Mané storm and your work was done on the roof of the tower.
On the other hand, Alison's reputation for losing her way through Hazard's.
The best place for the visitors came in 72 minutes when James Milner found the center of Bobby Firminon.
However, the half of Brazil’s population was headed by the poet David Luis, who saved the country’s capital.
So it didn't last for 89 minutes when the replacement Daniel Sturridge came free to shoot 25 meters.
Sturridge played his old house, and the attacker bombed it for its honor, unresponsive to the top.
Liverpool's hundreds of percent surplus came to a decision on level 1-1, but it's still in the pipeline, along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also very closely involved in the maritime navigation of two points behind the wheels.
In the case of climate change, the pathogens are heart-to-hearts
I remember when a newspaper about a decade ago asked about the different Finnish influence, which divides the Finnish people.
The answer to Juice Leskis was the only thought: the head of the team.
Some of the sexes have noses and some don't.
There's only one thing we can do to get a kid out of here, and there's one thing that's been offered.
Finland has been granted in the EU at the time of the annual transition.
Many feel the same about the fact that twice a year the transmission of the pellets has been a nightmare and caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement is at least the easiest step in the solution in Finland, although it has been easy.
The difficulty is now to decide which end of the clock is to end: the current summer or winter or some other period of time.
This will also make it possible for the people to say their opinion on the Ottagata.fi page.
The question is open to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it is open to families on 12 October.
The debate is held at a coffee shop and in social media, and everyone has a say in his speech.
They defend time based on their position in the morning on the well-being of the people and on the middle of the night on the influence of the voice of the outside world and through it on the well-being of the people.
Both sides have their support and good reason.
Studies also suggest that the morning light breaks down a person’s day and gives him an office.
On the other hand, if it does not suffer in the dark, increase the freedom to move people outside and give better opportunities to the sick, for example.
The amount of the additional amount has already been calculated for hours after normal working days.
I'd like to take both of you, but it's bad for us to sit in the north corner of the planet. We can't do anything.
The roofs are too dark and are too heavy in every case.
The debate on a typical subject is that its own views and other views are strongly opposed.
The arguments of the opposite side are not just heard, because it's important how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, there is a risk that some market will try to turn the other head.
That's where I'm going to go back to bed.
It is a matter of horror that is easy to claim, because the matter does not require great tension and, for reasons, sufficient mutual understanding.
In general, these types of questions are often discussed more closely and one without fruit.
I'm sorry if the wrong option becomes a complaint, but I don't agree with it.
And it always offers an appropriate sin offering if life is felt on the surface.
Josbah fought outside the neighborhood.
Josban's first neighboring game in Divar, Nurmon Jyya, produced three sets of matches against Nurmon Jyya.
Josba went from Seinäjojo to home to a 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still on the ground for the third time, but Joshua sought the compositions and turned the men into bones.
At the time of 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniem gathered a 6-5-votetomal.
The rest of the groups were played in the balance room for a few minutes.
Josban was more effective than Jusuo Lehtinemi (2+1).
The double box was powerful even when Teemu Tuhannen (1+1), Jere Karatnen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also arrived.
Miika Kosonenen (1+0) also saved her country during her birth in a dome cage.
Josbala is six minutes after three rounds.
The following will be visited by O2-Jyväsky two weeks later.
I'm going to church every Sunday for 200 years.
The next 200th anniversary of the church will be held tomorrow in very busy hours.
A week after that, the church was destroyed by a riot.
At the end of the church, they were warned to leave after two o'clock in the evening.
Despite the pain today, however, there is a place of worship.
Although no one would like to do that, the Enon Church is now the oldest church of the Joensun Congregation.
In the middle of the church, the cold has always been the heart of Eno despite all the country and other allies of the world.
The family is starting at the Enon Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we move to the circuit assembly outside the camp of a military coup d'état.
The program has a long day of all sorts inside and outside.
For example, a church council may be held in the home of a widow who served as a circuit overseer for 37 years in Ari Räässe.
The birth of the Church also means the end of one period.
Already removed from use, the Kingdom Hall built in 1982 has opened its doors for the last time today.
Now we're in the bathrooms in the former office, the Capitol Markku Koistenen says.
The Congregation Hall destroyed internal problems, but the church has stood healthy at that location for 200 years.
Elon Musk claims to be the head of the government of Tesla - Petos charges were agreed at $40 million
The manufacturer Tesla and the CEO of the company Elon Musk have agreed with the US Securities Market Authority SEC.
SEC doubted the Moscow prosecutor's claim for securities, and Musk was in danger of having taken a stand for his founding company.
But the music can continue as Tesla's delivery director.
Instead, Musk has to speak for three years at the place of the President of the Government of Tesla.
The company must be hired by the president of the foreign government.
Music also needs more control.
According to the agreement, Teslan has to pay two independent leaders and to monitor further the communication of Muski.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay at least 20 million dollars (about EUR 17 million) to match the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and the difficulties caused by Tesla's shareholders," says director Steven Peikin SEC.
The killing took place in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he could take the company out of the trash.
Music also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
Twitt's in charge of Teslan's part-time course.
The SEC suspected the Moscow prosecutor's worth of paper.
According to the Office, it was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company’s other manager or potential financiers.
In fact, the agency blamed Moscow for the abuse of investors.
The SEC announced that it had been attacked by the company and Muski as a whole.
The SEC stated its claim that Musk will be sentenced to trial and that he will be denied any further action by the tax companies.
SEC's challenge kept investors, and Teslan's share went into force in October.
More than 800 people died in the end of Indonesia and tsunamis
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, according to AFP, according to the disaster department of the country.
The number of deaths is still believed to be increasing, because the solution to the destruction is central.
According to former President Yusuf Kallan, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The current earthquake struck the tsunami that attacked the island of Sulawes, please in the city.
A warning was given immediately after the expiry of the tsunami, which, however, was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all the dead in the information are at least twice as different from the Flood.
The rescue authorities are concerned, inter alia, about the region of Dongäan, which is still very uncertain.
Now many people know that they're dead.
In order to ensure that the aid is granted, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.
The Indonesian army has been warned to help rescue workers find victims.
To the disaster area today, President Joko Widodon urged the soldiers to continue their rescues without delay day and night.
One of the main centers of rescue is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to be between 50 and 60 people on the streets.
The chief of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, told us that the famous Roa Roa-Roa hotel funerals were held at night in a private life.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
According to my concern, there would be a rapid increase in the supply of heavy fuel to the port and to the tsunami.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones.
Help, you in Palu and your neighbor.
My friend's family is still in the castle, one of the writer's friends was in the Facebook group.
The number of political calls per year in the hands of the terrorists in Britain
Many British politicians were alarmed when their contact information was publicly hidden in the application because of the lack of it.
The disturbances reached, inter alia, the telephone numbers of the ministers.
This included the application of the British Conservative Party meeting in the Government.
For example, British environmental, nutrition and rural ministers Michael Gove, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were in trouble.
A lot of citizens have been affected by the threat.
As a result of the lack of confidentiality of the application, the general approach was applied to policy profiles which were part of the Conservative Party's annual mobile application.
The public was able to access profiles using the policy email, which was easily available on the network.
The profile writer was able to view and form a profiled substance.
Someone was able to exchange Boris Johnson for a professional porn picture and the title.
Michael Goven was transformed into a professional mediamogul of Rupert Murdochin.
The Guardian Collegiate Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting was allowed to write to other people’s profiles on these e-mails.
The writers may then review the profile profile information and even send messages in this name.
The meeting took place on the number of every supplier, politician and participant, a public estimate, Foster.
The conservative party's informant asked for an apology.
He said that technical problems are solved and the application is now working safely.
The United Kingdom's IT support for the data year.
The application was created by an Australian Crown Comms company.
The workplace party in the opposition considers that the conservative party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland's public is every week a large number of Polish people who are being arrested.
Careful observers drew attention to the reactions of The Wall Finland's university programme.
The Wall quickly spread the U.S. format in the world, joining the Finnish version of Nelos last night.
Heikki Paasosen's parents game show is described in the same studio in Poland where other international productions are done.
In the study of the study, the possibilities were exceptional, as the size of the platform was 12 meters high in height required for space.
During the course of the social media, a programme of studies was introduced, which was launched as a semi-stakeholder.
On Twitter, the viridian discussed whether the students in the studio understood that half of the students were sitting at the game playing nothing.
The Head of Four Home Programs Unne Sormunen explains the matter to Night.
He tells us that the studio is close to the players, other Finnish, foreign residents in Poland, and even half of the audiences.
The public is made up of international defenders in Finland, even as in other countries as in the same production period The Wall.
In Finland, there are so many such professions, such as the so-called professional skills used in the descriptions of the various programmes, sormune experiences.
He recalls that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if it does not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green walls of the wall are easy to separate from each other.
However, there are translators who hold the translation.
There are two translations that translate into a simultaneous translation to the studio manager all the time.
And then the studio director guides the public and tells us what pass is going on there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormune says.
He compares the situation to how David and Hasselhoff were delivered in domestic production last summer.
David Hassselhoff was a few years ago with Talent in Finland's descriptions of us in Finland.
He had a full-time symphony interpretation, and he knew all that was said in the illustrations, the amount of Sormun.
Japan's subsidized Typhoonian front towards the arrival of a leader - the authorities warn of earthquakes and floods
Officials also warn of possible earthquakes and floods.
There are at least 50 people in the Taifuni Tram, but according to the authorities, the island of Vampire has been avoided and there is no other information about the death penalty.
The east coast of Okinawa has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK radio company, people have been evicted to the ground, and electricity has been stolen from over 300,000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been canceled, and the crews are in a position to stop because of the sea.
Myrsky is expected to be in close proximity to the Section for half a day in the time of Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the shores of the sea, but it also has strong winds and ports.
It's in Tokyo today.
According to legislators, Trami suffers from Japan to the mines.
I've got my nose in front of me.
This is a bad start.
The sky was already nearing its peak when the group disappeared on Saturday morning at home to Vaasan Sport, read more 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The police now have five fatalities, and the six points in the box are two.
None of the other advocates or two players below have yet to do the painting.
Pressures also grow all the time.
The sport against the public is already running at a time when the game was almost half behind it.
Six games have been saved, and of course there's no reason to do so.
I'm worried about it, because it's a bad thing we've saved.
In fact, the second time the presentation was devastating, Jerno Kärki told Essa the actions of 1+2.
Sports won, of course.
The group had a game from the background, so it would have been made visible.
Maybe it did, but these things didn't work out.
The day’s journey continued to grow
The day's mother, Kirkko Hyvärinen, admires the overall number of events that take place in the island's view.
Some thought it might not be so many people this year, the Hyvrvarin will meet in the morning.
In July 2017, the Tractoric SM negotiations were held at the same time with Sunday, so the expectations that the total number could be slightly lower than the previous year.
On the other hand, however, it took a long time before ten, the sellers told the end of the products, the resale was sold at almost 500 doses, and the Hyvärnen heard the rise in the number of cars.
The estimate of travel time has been about 6000, the Holy Tells Later in the evening.
At five o’clock in the morning and in the afternoon, there was a particularly large amount of programs for children, which would have attracted them to the preview area.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimated that it would take longer than that.
Salesmen also visit Liberia each year from their own territory.
This year, sales of producers, handlings, shipping and shipping products had reached almost one hundred of their customers.
On Sunday, Mother Prickko Hyvarinen admired the generality of the audience.
A hundred of them were blessed on Saturday.
In the children's series, Teija Kivinie's beautiful song won a general vote.

7 x beautiful white - from this you know a good lamp
Raise your mind to the spirit, create the right feeling of commitment, and read your eyes without letup.
Good lighting supports a bag.
We brought together three good reasons to point to the light.
Vinkit gave Innolux to the marketing and marketing director, Tarja Jokinemi.
Make service to your eyes
The importance of correction increases what is behind the years of age.
A sufficient amount of time can be spent on problems that many will face over the age of time when the sense of loss is reduced and frustration is increasing.
The need for parental authority is also growing.
Six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-s
Thus, the effects of alcohol on the environment and the properties of light are supported by a set of health conditions already in place.
Good light gives enough light, but it's not bad, Jokiniem.
Create beauty around you
It's only a fair way to show up with the right light.
At this point, the container has a choice.
In Sweden, there is a Japanese-style combination of beauty, scandalousness and Japanese.
On the other hand, a 70-year-old inspiration with a modern and play-up retrotyly strong color, metal-degradable or oil-coloured, has grown to a high level.
The aid is as expensive as the house in other parts of the country.
Materials now see wood, concrete, ceramic, paper, leather and cotton.
Display Your Personality
The house is now divided into more than before, and it has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want to talk at home, even in the dark, where they have a story to tell.
People clearly apply for Finnish and Nordic products whose origins and designers are known.
So there's a lot of design information, Jokinemi says.
It is not necessary to buy a new trend device at home, but a classic that has been saved for many years.
In fact, the ignorant, arrogant, and elegant classics keep their surface in mind for the second year, Jokiniem says.
Thank you and I'll see you.
KooCo showed the door to the Canadian thief after three games.
Koo Koon and the attackers, Brendan O'Donnel's tracks are breaking up.
The Canadian leader played three Liiga operations together without any tools, KooKoo tells in his report.
In August, O'Donnell transferred to the Single-Year Agreement, which included a sustainable period of time at the end of September.
In the last 26 years, the attackers have played in KHL in the Red Star River and in the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no information about O'Donnel's new follow-up yet.
The player wants to look like an example in rotation -- the goods go to the world's turning points, the shape changes to paper.
The Special Game Game Games are currently being converted into packaging materials in addition to the game.
The products of the customer's bicycle shop are no longer packaged for fashions, but for packaging material made of paper.
For example, the products listed on the network are packaged for packages from farmers.
All the packages that come to us are going to be re-use.
We can use tables ten times, as long as the package is in good condition that it can be used, Ville Puurula Oulun is told about the game.
As a core material, the company shall make use of either word or other related rolling stock.
The cubs will be avoided as long as possible.
In recent times, it is our intention to move to the recycling material even in the scrolls.
The move wants to show others an example.
It is not a matter of extreme hardship to turn to Puulala.
It's not a big problem to turn around.
This includes savings, for example, when used as a novelty.
The rotation is naturally compatible with the operation of the Games, as the games and equipment used, including the main product selection of new products, include the movement of new products.
Each piece of information: One and the same piece works in each place
Classes work through the second place rather than the second place.
They create a good basis for garderobic multi-use, as it is easy to collect different habitats around quality classics.
The most widely used classics in the skin area are quality flowers.
This category also belongs to a black half.
There is no fault in the natural material produced black in these semi-collars.
The garment can be joined to both straight legs, to soft flesh, and around it can be made up of a small housing and a broad style.
The pool is suitable for young and modern woodpeckers and classic beautiful style markets.
I saw you trust the style.
Syksy's trends are due to the use of blood and fatty acids, the black half-life and the third-life kidney.
In the middle of the class, along with the other classics, the blue-red and wine-red loafers, they form a female and beautiful home.
It is a blackish, blackish, by combining it with the trendy velvets of the grass: the fragrant grass, the tall grass, and the fatty weaves.

The satellite activity of Russian intelligence services has a long history
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign communication to the SVR or the GRU's military communication would have been released from this activity.
The so-called DRG groups had special features during the summer activity of the Council.
The name will be a group of Russian-speaking disseminating groups: the Sabatoasis and the Information Group.
The experts working in the western KGB security service are preparing detailed plans for important satellite locations, told the KGB's archipelago architect Vasili Mitros (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s.
The areas included ports, lakes, large basins, oil spills and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired the DRG group for the uniforms and seating operations of Bundeswehr, railways, freight guards and information providers.
This trick was used by Russian law enforcement officers in Crimea in February 2014: they were involved in local Ukrainian police bombings, based on checks carried out by Ukrainian leaders, and separated from the Crimea country.
In the course of the Cold War, the agents of the Sabatoasi group were meeting the needs of the country with mines, explosives, explosives, and means of communication.
Another year in 1998 in Switzerland, the KGB found the hand of the bomber, who was fired by the authorities when it was burned on the water.
Police aimed at four train days in the country last night
The police were arrested on the various sides of the Northern Karillaa four bicycles on Friday and Saturday night.
At 18 years of age, an accountant man spoke 1,57 promulgated.
He spent half a night at the beginning of the Kayaanths, asking for two passengers.
At the Volvijärven Kuorvarantan, the car broke into four at night, and the only one in the car was a 19-year-old local man who spoke to the police for 1.54 prom.
He didn't have any serious bleeding.
In the middle of the highway, a 20-year-old foreign man approached an Alkometer 1,33 miles [133 km] away.
The police suspects these men from the Turkish railway station and from the Polvijärve transporter.
On Saturday morning in the Tuupovavara, the local package car was transported by a 36-year-old man to the mouth of 0.52 prom.
I doubt he's on the wheel break.

As a witness on TV today: The killer was left to die twice
An American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experiences.
The photos of the East have been taken from them.
Everest is now getting her first time on Finland's TV.
In May 1996, the destruction of Lumimyrsky surprised the climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormakur’s 2015 guide tells of the solution that has been dealt with in the field.
The tragedy has taken pictures and documents from the past.
The facts are also discussed in this case.
The world's tallest mountain, 22 years ago, is the life of eight footballers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the racing community: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just that Hall works at Weathers' school.
The spirit of Weathers could have saved before Nepal's departure.
As a result, he lost sight of it and the air pressure, and therefore the spell was to be left between.
Rob Hall went on his trip and he didn't come back.
Weather's struggle for life and death, however, had begun.
At Myrsky's height, he disappeared, and he hasn't found his way back to the camp.
When a man came to find him, he was found in such a bad condition that he did not believe in the resurrection.
Weathers was left dead.
But as a miracle trade, he got on his feet and found others.
Sadly, Weathers was thought to continue to die, and once again he was left alone with his own foot.
It's obvious that, unlike other expectations, Beck Weathers remained in the spirit.
At some point, fellow believers too began to believe that he had been helped.
In the film, Beck Weathersie presents Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today has been celebrating the church of Eno for 200 years.
The church has been held today since 200 years of age by the church.

The festivals began at the church of Eno at the time of the 10th family of the family, after which the occasion was offered at the Enon Congregation Hall.
The church was full.
The family attended 517.
First, Mr. Armi Rautavour was glad that people had come to the church so much.
It's a great joy still long and gives power to work, Routavuri (in the picture).
The fire of the church of the reconnaissance has touched many, and it has not been visited in the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
In the first church, the church is now destroyed by the church of the former Evangelical Congregations of Joensuu.
In 1770, the wooden church was formed.
In the antiquities crisis, a map was arranged in the morning, where a church destroyed in the palace was delayed and repatriated.
Photos and Videos: My doctor left a great deal in Greece - The sea lost and the loss changed for a while
A powerful symmetrical sysmmetry took place on Saturday morning in Greece.
I've been called Zorb as my international surgeon, or my doctor.
The Greek Air Station has issued a red warning to the areas of Attica, Peloponnesos, Jonah Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
In the pictures taken from the background, you can see a lot of the comings around Greece.
On Twitter, the video shows how the houses in the city of Kiaton have appeared together in the Corinth area for some reason to come.
The second video shows how the car has had to be transported by steaming water.
In the name of the playoffonezosus, the heavy wind caused strong flooding.
Finland's Athenian Grand Duchy guides people on the Facebook page to secure the darkness in Greece.

My extracurricular rupture, or my doctor, brings with him arms and even the backbone.
According to CNN, according to a 2011 study published by the medical doctor, only once or for two years around the world, typically due to the high temperature of the sea.
Now, the spoken darkness left the arrivals in Tunisia and Libya before it continued its journey to northern Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also caused refugees on such islands as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps are limited in their access to adequate protection.
In the middle of the Middle East, the region is also destroyed in the Athenian environment.
In Greece, my doctor also took drugs in November.
The sea doesn't have to go now, flying in timetables - in the threat of syysmmyrsk in the Greek islands, the best of thousands of Finns
The boats that sail on the sea are set and are also encouraged to be careful not to cross the coast or other coastal waters on the seabed.
Such instructions have been distributed to the railway 3,500 in Greece through the Eastern European Union for a Finnish weekend.
The events will be necessary because even the fear - inspiring Zorbas winter has been predicted to be a slow Greek island this week.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed may rise in the woods up to 45 metres per second.
It's a lot of hatred that's going to increase the number of lines.
All passengers from Finland who have reported their telephone numbers through the Eastern and South Finland have been warned by the tour operators by means of strong wind text messages.
However, the sun and the heat
According to Inka Ikosen, an expert in the communication of the Sunshine Sunsets has been avoided from the worst in summer.
For example, flights have been calculated and increased according to normal schedule.
We've been following the situation all the time.
Security is on the way.
I brought the media reporter Antonia Schroederus says that their flight has also been on schedule.
We are constantly in touch with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the beginning of the day.
The roads are the most popular in Greece's islands, including Rhodex and Crete, currently totaling 1,500 Finnish explorers.
In addition, few hundreds of passengers are allowed to stay in smaller areas.
For example, the worst drought in the Koss Islands gets to the sun in the morning.
On the other side of the night, Rodoks had watched the sun and the temperature fell 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C], the account of the Icon of the Sun.
Zorbachen has been considered to be the next major Turkey, in fact a little west.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, for example, and have reviewed the number of Finnish flights to Antalya Tue, says Schroeder.
Shirley Karvisella and Janni Hussille are completely identical to those in the mastics - so they react to the situation.
The media person and fitness coach Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Suomi's final in the open night.
Huss will tell you what he's got from Meslewi.
I went to the movement and I decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great kiss this night, Huss smile.
In fact, the same summer afternoon was the choice of one of Shirley Karvin's guests.
The two also noticed themselves living in the same place and faced the situation with a smile.
Karvine told him at night-Samim that he was coming to get ready quickly, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussis works as a backstage and red carpet driver in the missionary field, and he talks about the importance of the adventures that have reached the place.
There's a slight change back in the Hussy, because he changed as a family from Campis to Jätkäsar.
Now, I'm going to stay there, let's see what's going on.
It's funny that in the new apartment there's your own office, on Hussein.
Before I changed Hussein's name in Greece alone.
It was great. I was just in a hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress hit me, I got a fluff, but otherwise I was really successful, Hussein's story.
The use of Shirley Karvise at the airport raised a great deal of attention - a series of live eyeglasses
In 2016 and 2016, Miss Suomi Shirley Karvinen told Miss Suomi's final performance on a red map of her performance with radio broadcasts and Love Island Suomi photos.
The speed has been sufficient even to ensure that Karvin reached its final destination from Finnair.
I've got to go and put my hair in the car.
This is the glamorous.
I'll be back in the morning, Carvin's wedding.
Karvin's gonna tell us all about his own body in the middle of the living.
His preparation also aroused the interest of his colleagues.
I had a big game, and I had a blind man's eyes.
I was at least interested in the opinion of others.
Karvin will fly to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he'll be in a few days.
Karvin tells us how he enjoys his holiday as a member of the Love Island of Finland.
He describes his experience as being so far to stop.
Karvin's going to tell you when he's starting to slow down as a spring breaker.
It's kind of serious.
These are the real feelings of the people, Karvine describes the feelings of the victims of the program.
How did they cross the border?
Three perfect examples
The classic features are the accessories that work through the second place rather than the second place.
Often the classics are ten years old, but sometimes modernized individuals are able to do so.
A few years ago, as a result of drought and drought, overfishing has not been removed.
According to that name, the dust surfaces gradually returns to normal for a year and a season.
They seem to be able to share user opinions, but they encourage the model to support trials, no - no - no - no - no - no.
The superintendent is rightly suited to any local situation.
It's about the color, the length, the thickness, or the tricko, the simple skin or mechanical action of the toes.
Longevity is seen in both the festivals and the archaeologists.
The blacks are a great match to the warmest locals.
They adequately balance the choice of the male, the female, and the female, even the female.

It's easy, but it's so sweet!
Two robot cars start moving to Espoo
They're moving through the end of the year, and they're taking passengers to bed, the city of Espo.
Otanian robotics work in the role of the bus driver, because first of all, in the dryer area, it is intended to launch your traffic on a robotic bus.
The project develops and pilots the year-round robotic traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles in Finland.
In the test, you'll find out how robotic cars pass through the current cave network.
The same city offers robotics the opportunity to develop technology in the real environment, says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic vehicles are fully automatic in the presence of other vehicles without special transport systems.
The safety of the guns is always met by the aidee.
The armed forces have been in a number of different angles throughout their lives and have assessed whether they are free of charge.
If it is not, they will explain whether a vehicle, a bomber or, for example, a helicopter has been detected, tells Sensible 4 of the delivery director Harry Santamala, who is responsible for the development of robotic transport.
Robotio cars run all three days a week: Tuesdays 13-15.30, Wednesdays 10-15 and Thursdays 10-15.
The robots stop at six stop on the road and take passengers to bed.
You stopped the robotics, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

The mokoma-ythye is based on the lava from the middle of the kitchen and the toilet.
Mokoma-yhe tells us about the amazing situation on the Facebook page at Tampere's Package Hall.
At Tampere's apartment, the sky was turned into a dramatic turning on Sunday when the band founded Santtu Henälänen broke out from the lava to the center.
The situation got worse when the band was on its way south.
This guy's got a lot of trouble.
The band will know about this on the Facebook page.

Let's hope for a much better metal line!
The short ends of the chain tend to be on the safe side, read on the pages.
Many fans respond to an alarmed update where bastist-Santtu makes a hole in his hands in the bed.
This news has been expected, it was time to worry about how bad it was.
The relief is great, you'll get better through time.
Tsempi and long steps to Santu and go on to another band plus a thousand!

Police control the forest in North Karjala and Savo
The East-Suomen police station conducted forest control on Friday and Sunday with the Metsäaltungungungungungung and the Finnish gas station in North Karjalas and North-Savo, the police officers told the social media on Sunday.
The supervisory authority was in the law of the forest and in the credibility of the forest.
Each forest species was subject to a review of the forest map and the State country's forest authorisation.
In addition, the control levels for forest fires and the authorized number of self-propelled weapons used in the canal investigation were reviewed.
According to the police, 112 forest owners were checked during the control period, and only one forester was found to be lacking the required forest authorisation.
An unauthorized request was made for 12 days.
In addition, the police denied 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them were suspicious of the railway ban.
In addition, the parties dealt with five traffic jams, once again the police.
It can be said, together, that foresters are very well aware of the likelihood of forest destruction.
A lot of farmers were surprised at the control.
One forester claimed that "I've been foresting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The East Finland police station continues to monitor forest management in conjunction with other supervisory authorities.
Moscow goes to Turkey to follow the choice of Syrian quota packs
Minister of Interior Kai Mykkänen (K.k.) is travelling to Turkey in the near future to follow up on the election of future quota refugees from Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugees this year.
The elections are usually held several times a year, including representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Labour and Economic Affairs and the police.
The Security Council is already in the best position to deal with the challenge in Turkey.
UNHCR first selects persons in particular vulnerable areas.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be refugees in a particularly vulnerable area, such as single - parent families, orphans and the sick, women and children.
More people will be selected in the future groups in Finland than there are in the continent, because in practice some remain unreachable for various reasons.
I would also like to see the civil organisations operating at the border of the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylun and Syrian.
The trip also includes the national mayor of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Lukka Salmi.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concluded that the Commission did not consider that the aid granted by the Commission was compatible with the internal market and that the aid granted by the Union industry was compatible with the internal market.
Finland has taken the quota packages from the 1970s.
Last year the quota has been 750 packs a year.
The price was 1,050 years for a couple of years, but the government did not then have the right to raise it.
The meeting has supported the weight rise, but the project has finally failed against you.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Cep.) recently presented the increase of the quota by 1 500-2,000 people per year.
The major visit is the first in this government to be made by the Minister of the Interior to follow up on the selection of the quotas.
Former Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (c.) and Paula Risikko (c.) had to move to their new assignments before the visitors were scheduled.
Finland will receive EUR 10 000 from the EU for each of the payments in particular in the affected area.
Now let's go to the polls - we don't know if it's funny or funny anymore.
On the last day of the month, the karjaline renewed the legislation to amend the animal health code.
The article found that legislation originally prohibits the holding of all animals which are not specifically permitted under the regulations of the ministries.
Thus, all other animals mentioned in the specific Regulation are initially prohibited.
If legislation is concluded, it means that we are ignoring the general principle in Western democracies that the law prohibits, in particular, activities that threaten social security or a good way of life.
It is now in the process of prohibiting all acts which are not permitted by law or regulation.
The change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tested in the company, for example, and to do nothing before the law or regulation adopted.
The operation of the government in the legislative process has generally been weak.
If we are now going to know that in Finland, initially, everything is prohibited, which is not otherwise permitted, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I'm not sure if you're not asking for an update.
But this legislation does not belong to democracy.
I do not know the Constitution very well, but I think it will accept such a "all prohibited procedure which is not permitted by law or regulation" as a separate procedure.
Hopefully, there is a wise minister who will stop the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell wins: I'm sick of four trends in cancer
The trend of this disease is going to be in the womb.

Alexia's baby, 3 cc, slamming slowly on Jeren's neck
At the centre of the family of the kingdom, a three-month-old Alexia virus will rise.
Nana Karalahti tells Keraval based on the Aito Date code.
Traveller Nana Karalahti, 30, and ex-school student Jere Karalahti, 43, received family inheritance from July.

On Wednesday, the Greek air service provided a red warning to the regions of South Greece at Attica, Peloponnesos, Jonah Islands, Cycladen and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Greece's travel agencies warned of the Finnish Zorba drought in Greece.
The Finnish Athenian Grand Duchy would also publish a Myrsky Warning.
Travellers were invited to follow legal procedures and instructions from local authorities.
A little while after I got in touch, there was a lot of wind and a lot of rain.
People were very quiet, and the newsman from Laura Aalton's Tui office told the STT this evening.
Aalton described the situation in the same way as on Saturday.
Last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also not received any messages from the Finnish missing.

Kim Räikönen visited the cause of Mercedes's improvement compared to Ferrari's.
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was able to admit that the worst competitor in Mercedes was too strong back in Russia's gp times.
However, there is no need for panic in the Ferrari store, the experienced driver assesses.
They were just faster than we were, but there's no big deal about it.
Our car was the best time for the whole weekend, but they were just too fast, four times too early, and their talent with Sebastian Vettelli was clearly left behind by the word of Räikkönen.
Ferrara had a hard time in the past in Singapore.
In the meantime, the question was raised as to what is really going on in the case of Mercedes' request.
They seem to go faster than we are. It's so simple.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always an assessment, and they seem to be us right now.
Does she know why?
In time, there was a slight decline in the future of Räikkös in the case of Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrara for the first time, was the seventh, and the last ageing season was also marked by Marcus Ericsson.
Ten refugees in Sweden are best for over three years.
And while in the second season, five drivers left all the way behind, the result was that they were in a bad mood for Sauber.
And what about the future of a brave warrior?
Yes, if you compare where they were from, there's been a big step forward.
There's a different story in the first year, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius, your cousin Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Heleneus and Erka Teper's visit to Stuttgart last night at the same time.
The German was in the process of becoming a more proactive party, but he did not have the right skills for the family.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the take by severe cross-sections that were found to be very good for the family.
Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The explosion finally came to an end in one of the eight days when Helenus fell to the left in direct contact with Teperin.
Osama was so strong that she did not even try to climb up the stairs in front of her house.
When I was sure of this, Helenius suddenly came to the front.
In his late teens, he began to develop a good sense of identity with his opponent.
Then he changed his tongue for a moment.
Thank you for all the viewers and Finnish advisors.
We were taken by night today.
Hellenius was happy right after the reception.
That was a really great victory for the daughter of Helen.
Perhaps it would be possible to get access to MM treatment, Helenus's comment to the Night before the night.
Instead, the killer would have been able to decide the whole robbery.
Of course it's been remembered.
There's no more young man here, 34-year-old Helenus admitted before Teper.
The number of enemy attacks in Indonesia can be multiplied
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country is calling for a clear increase in the victim's murder.
According to former President Yusuf Kallan, the total number of enemies can rise to thousands.
Poor conditions
The rescuers were looking for survivors of the disaster and also the victims of the suffering of the Sulawes island: from the port city and its neighboring village Dongâna.
Secondly, all the victims are from Palu, Donghan's situation is still missing.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are injured.
There are still people who have not been able to get out of the fighting buildings.
For example, Roa Roa's hotel in Palu has been created.
The rescuers are echoing the cries of the rest of the people, but the lack of armed forces has slowed down the beginning of rescues.
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo has appointed the military to rescue and attack equipment.
It is necessary for the military and its shipyard, because in the disaster zone, electricity and computer communications are many places away.
The fuel savings are also in demand.
Miss Suomi's infamous response and a long tradition led to a hunger strike
Billnas in Sweden will be selected for the best of the new Miss Finland.
A question was raised to each of the dissidents during the interrogation period.
The financiers raised the question of the balance sheet.
In particular, the number six of Emilia Anttikoske, 23, the unfathomable response came to the place at the time of the general, but beautiful jokes.
The question raised to the Antics was brought through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what's the last book that has been read misfinally.
Antiochus thought he was responding well before the riots started.
Thank you for asking, Kirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said about it.
In general, the report was received by the Court of Justice until Antioch continued to respond:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
I'm sure there's something about the economic data.
So the last book I've read is that someone against you, Anttikoski.
After his response, Anttikoski received from the general apologies from the public as a stopover.
Later, under misdemeanoured Antioch, he turned his attention to the fact that he did not want to take up arms because of his principle.

The symbols don't attract friends - Four facts from the union
What does it do about a person's recommended, charismatic, or beautiful?
The researchers of the University of Sydney have analyzed the case with two small-scale "cool" boys, who are made up of two different boundaries: a generally attractive college and that I was part of the opposite secondary school.
Unfortunately, there were many socially desired boundaries in schools, according to the researchers ’ description: they were outgoing, friendly, appropriate and capable.
There were also typical prejudices, selfishness, capitalism, and pride among the others.
They were in the process of drawing experiences and keeping only a small amount of external evaluations.
Both types combined a good sense of self and a strong sense of life.
The role of Kavis is no longer cool: high status in teen years does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is how a United Nations study published in the 2014 Child Development chapter is published.
In the early years of young people who were closely observing, photographed, applied to good looks, and tried to recommend others, young people had increased the risk of using days and days to think about crimes.
In human relationships, they were weaker than they were in the past.
In high status, lupuss, brands, or bells don't make a man's cooly or at least an attractive follow-up.
In a study published in the August Social Psychological and Privacy Science, a large part of the people were willing to develop their friendship in a normal market rather than to be marked with those who were trapped, even though most of them chose a better place in the knowledge situation.

During the weekend in southern Greece, you can get as much water as in Finland for half a year.
The Zorbas-Herhummyrmysky ice during the week of Greece.
Be careful if you live in the region of Peloponnesos, Jonah Islands, Cyclaaden or Crete.
Myrsky is very powerful, so the Finnish Athenian Supreme Court announces it on the Facebook page.
According to the Grand Duchy, the Greek air service has given the regions a red warning.
In the near future, there will also be a provision in Forecan's blog.
It says that the most severe trees in the lake are up to 45 meters per second.
Because of comparison, from the beginning of Finland, the Kuisma-mursky spoke the strongest route in 31 meters per second.
According to the blog Zorbas-Myrskin, however, the greatest concern is not the wind, but the sandy beaches.
During the week, you can get more than 300 millimetres of water in South Korea.
It's about half of Finland's annual seed.
Severe Weather Europe has shared the development of the video sea on Facebook.
Zorbas-Mursky has caused the arrival of Tunisia and Libya this week.

Mr. Botts, will he help you with the adrenaline in Sotshi?
Valteri Bottas was a little more than ten minutes after his flight from Russia's gp when he was in front of the media.
The fine circle left behind Merced's company Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a vital criticism to the Finnish poet in this way.
It's going to turn.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the center of the settlement.
It's feeling good, it's kind of important yet, Bottas has found out.
I've been leaving this year only once, in the Middle East, so time is spent in law.
This bike was good for me earlier, and I got a good ride back.
So it's not easy to finish the Sotshin radar, so it's going to be especially important.
And of course, Bottas was able to answer the question, whether he's gonna win tomorrow or whether he's in front of Hamilton, who's close to MM.
The point of my departure is, of course, that I try to win.
There can be no other purpose in leaving, Buttas refused.
But then we'll fight both of these monsters.
The leader of Lewis is Sebastian Vettelin's time, and I'm quite different, so it should be remembered.
Let's see what's going on, but Bottas is full of you.
After some time, Hamilton was very happy about the success of Bottsen, and the taste of Toto Wolffle's Toto.
The Lewis had a plan to win the Valtter, but he didn't succeed in a standoff.
The governor knows that he has to review everything he has to do in order to win Lewis.
And he was so excited that the adrenaline from your bag out, Wolff failed.
The question is whether Botts and Hamilton's time was right, Wolff answered the charges.
We'll discuss tomorrow morning, and see how your friend goes.
The Chinese Erno Kinnunen arrived at the capital city of Finland in the street
The SM series of the railway vehicle was closed rarely.
I've never heard of the brothers who have ever ended up as masters of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen in his decision-making area in the environment of the Turun and Salon, because Eerik won SM1 and Henrik SM2.
The Chinese Erno Kinnunen guaranteed the best achievement of his career when the third place I decided to sign to him of the SM4 category of two-year-old cars in Finland.
Honda Civicl, a contestant in the Kinningungen and Maple Lücken Ville Mäkelä started with the market participation model because the starting points were clear: the rent in the ski group returned to the SM title.
In the darkness of the spring, two had to be given a level when some of the extra resources were thrown into another special trial.
It's got to set up a third floor.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to hold hands.
On Saturday, only the second row was followed by Justin Tepon's speed.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their group
The Syrian Foreign Minister requires the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their group from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Meeting on Monday morning, said that foreign groups must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
I remember saying that foreign forces are fighting terrorism in Syria, and the war against terrorists is “the end” according to him.
In the UN, Muallem also urged the Syrians to return to their homeland.
However, the seven years for the continued war will not seem to end.
The war has killed more than 360,000 people.
As a member of the Union, Angela Merkel told her family in Germany that in October, there was plans to meet Syria, which would also include the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans looked at the Supreme Court of Justice TV.
Judge Bret Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who are in charge of his concern, received a very different number of people from the surrounding areas.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were on the top of their televisions.
I came to Donald Trumpin, who was named Kavanaugh and who was responsible for his concern, Professor Blasey Ford, was in front of the Senate's trial committee in front of his story.
According to the results from the start, there were six main audiences: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, total 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their network, millions more followed.
The NCB reported that the survival rate was 6.8 million people, and the CNN reported on the beginning of the year’s forecast of 8.2 million lives.
The number of CNNs increases by more than 10 million when youtuben and Facebook account for the follow-up.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million.
Digital startups are the property of the canals, television viewing is originally from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final numbers on Earth, but they are, in each case, the most common.
It's about 20 million.
In the United States, over 20 million spectators will normally only be admitted to the sports industry, the world's largest Oscar and Grammy branches, and hundreds of political events, such as presidential talks and presidential elections in 2016.
In the U.S. annual watch programme, the U.S. football team's NFL's final trade in Super Bowl is on its way.
This year, Super Bowl collected some 103 million people across the street from the NBC.
During the last year, the first talk of the assembly in Trump, according to Nielsen, was viewed by some 48 million people and 30 million officials.
Quick-dry
The Supreme Court of Justice is an extremely important case in the United States because the authorities are alive.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia disappeared from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing President Barack Obama from appointing him as his successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was the representative of the Republican President, Ronald Reagan, but he was in many of the issues of the so-called civil war that the vote could be resolved on behalf of the nine-year-old Court of Justice.
He was an advocate of the rights of abortion and sexual abuses and, for example, in 2015 ruled that the same sex had acquired the right to marriage throughout the Union.
Kavanaugh is significantly more conservative than the cannon.
His choice of the highest right may be to read the ten-year term of the right conservation force.
Children have the right to access their information to their parents
Only 10-year-olds will see their children's health records on the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Of course, the situation of the Kanta service at the beginning of the day was even more alarming: the parents were not even able to look at minor health data or prescriptions.
The situation was temporarily corrected by a period of less than 10 years in 2016.
Thereafter, the procedures have been allowed to be corrected, but the adjustment has been far from surprising.
Now, the correction is on leave in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the amendment of the legal framework should not have been more than an emergency.
Then, with the understanding of the world, it is about the pressure of the nose: now that the baby is arrested, it is opened.
A child can show his information to his parents if he has a bank account or an official personal card.
But how many 10-year-olds are there?
The personal card is taxable, and the banknotes are not even available at the age of 10.
In practice, the fourth grade data in the school will not be able to see anyone other than by asking for them.
This is not about the rights of parents and children.
It is extremely important for the child to be treated so that the parents can be involved.
It is natural to care for the privacy of secondary-age rights.
They may also have family members who cannot talk about all things freely.
They are often associated with sexual health, which is a very important human right.
In the United States, the FBI initiated a decommissioning of disturbances against Kavanaugh
According to U.S. media, the FBI will find at least two women's surprises.
One of the other women was hearing the Senate's hearing this week.
Kavanaugh has challenged the charges of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
In the United States, President Donald Trump appointed the FBI to resolve the charges on the request of the Senate's judicial committee.
The explanation can't last a week longer.
According to Washington Post, it's a crime investigation of a more limited solution, and it's not necessarily becoming public.
A man threatened to kill a police officer in Kajaan.
In addition, the incineration of the cliques continued in the rooms.
The police tell the police that they're putting a man's gun on the police station.
The police had to face the threat of a suspect's ill-treatment on the other side of the night in Kajana.
The official is aware of the incident that began when a 30-year-old man desperately challenged to be in the central hospital.
The man was a bad guy from the other customer in the hospital.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
The killer out there attacked another man by beating him on the ground.
When the third party tried, the man found him too.
A third-party incident led to a police call.
The party took the man and took him to the police station, the police tell him.
The suspect was still aggressively used by the police.
A man would shoot another cop on his feet.
He threatened to kill the cops, and he threatened to kill the cops.
The police tell the man to "smooth down" his passport.
The man is suspicious of the three abuses and the violent opposition of the official.
Aid organizations are preparing to start work in the Indonesian Sulawese - "Plud Water is the fastest."
The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to assist Indonesia Sulawesi, according to Finnish news agency Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading rescue, but the need for additional equipment is already apparent at this stage.
UNICEF works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal action, UNICEF has always had full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people from the grave, both living and dead.
In the city of Sulawesi, rescue measures are under way, but in the Donghean region, the situation is somewhat more unclear.
There are places before which contacts are not working.
The aid measures are difficult because they are also away, the truth is that Haru.
The buildings are often high in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
When our survivors are found, they need protection, for example, from the beginning of the Flood and clean water.
Clean water is the fastest in crisis situations.
First of all, the most people can be provided with water cleanup tablets, which are also in the warehouse of UNICEF.
Water systems are trying to fix as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported primarily in rivers.
In crisis situations, many children are getting away with their parents.
The search for family members and the integration of families is part of the task of UNICEF.
Food aid is also part of the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, emergency equipment will be used in advance.
However, in other words, UNICEF has already launched a financial crisis to help the Indian landscape and tsunami victims.
billionaire Elon Musk ends up as the president of the government of Teslan - 20 million dollars of coins
Elon Musk, founder of warning structures and electric cars companies, avoids fraud under an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
billionaire Elon Musk will cease to be the president of the Teslan government and will be responsible for 20 million dollars.
Musk claims to be part of the agreement he concluded with the US Securities Markets Authority.
By agreeing that Musk avoids fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Moscow's securities contract due to its fraud in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing an electric car company for Tesla's removal from the dust, which gave the company a rapid increase in the share rate.
According to the agreement, Musk cannot act as President of the government of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Teslan has to be appointed as its government as a new "unaccompanied member" and to take two "non-compulsory leaders".
Teslan must also establish a committee to monitor the communication of Muski.
The music can still continue as Tesla's delivery director.
In addition to the 20 million dollars of staff, Tesla also has to pay 20 million shares to the financial supervisor.
Delay between rolls while the pointer is moving
According to SEC, Muskin was led by investors and Teslan shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the funding that Tesla would buy from the Persians again as your private subsidiary.
According to billionaires, the company would have been purchased out of its share price of $420.
The Tésla share rate increased by more than 10 per cent in the afternoon, but later it fell.
According to the SEC, Muskin's claim was no basis.
According to the audit, he did not actually negotiate his claim for funding.
He had also not discussed the association with another group of leaders or company governments.
This week, the rate dropped by 14 per cent when SEC’s securities auditors reported corruption.
The new agreement is expected to re-establish the company's rates.
The last judgment is not a cause
Of course, the roots of the tree are not dry when visas are not moving.
That's a technical message.
The storm of the Helsinki court has been halted.
The visas show the time of two days.
The situation is like a medieval horror scene: even when the church heard of the church’s screams and screams would come to its own.
This is not a natural test, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it's gone.
It's been seen by a repairer, but some of them have gone wrong and are expected to have a new part, the resurrection of Evelyn James.
By the same time, James will confirm the church in Helsinki - a Twitter style already mentioned.
The Court stated that the last judgment was not a cause for the suspension of the appeal.
James tells me the church's bells aren't the same because of him.
