Valiant additional deputates are worried about what they look like marinettes.
Some deputists do not understand why their deputative status should be changed to the status of the House of Wales.
The MPs refused to change the name of the local walk on the name of the House of Wales.
The computers of all political views think it's some shame.
One deputate-liberal said his colleagues were worried that it was summed up with the words "drunny" and "undead".
For readers outside Wales: in the Russian language twp means "door", and pwp means "indangerous".
The deputy said that her group was not fully satisfied and offered alternatives.
Valais conservators said their group was ready to discuss the change in the name of the origin, but they noted that it was a short-term transition from a member of the Valiant Parliament to a "Mariette".
In this context, the Italian letter is the same as the Greek english letter u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing the draft Act on the Elimination of Change on the Name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Members of the House are calling for will, of course, be the question of the members themselves."
The Law on the War of Wales from 2017 gives Valiansk the right to change his own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the national consultation on the proposals in which there was a broad support to call for progress by the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the adoption of an additional deputate, the Commission has given priority to members of Parliament of Wales or the CUP, but the CUP variable has received the greatest support during public consultations.
Additional deputates, apparently, suggest alternative variants, but the way to reach consensus may be the main pain for elders, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to present a bill on changes in weight for several weeks.
The reform demands will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on the disaggregation of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional delegates will be able to conduct a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they are doing their bidding.
Macedonians vote on the referendum by changing the country's name
On Sunday the electors will declare their country's name in the Republic of Northern Macedonia, or oppose it.
The national vote was organized to resolve a many-year question from neighbor Greece, which has its own area under the name of Macedonia.
In Athens they have long maintained that their name of their northern neighbour represents their presence on their territory, which has hindered Macedonia's inclusion and friendship in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
President George John John of Macedonia, a referendum on the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the prime minister of the referendum, in this regard Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, asserts that the change of the names is simply a cost to be paid after entering the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The temples of Saint Martin slammed, the boars in Garlem win for the existence of
"Before, as the old people I talked to were, there was a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
'Today there is neither one here nor another'
He said that the destruction of the bar was understandable.
"People have different relationships and relationships at present," he said.
"The bars are no longer the bare local rooms where people go on to stay."
As for the churches, he is not concerned that the money from selling has been activated for such a long time as it is expected by the letters, and sooner or later they will return there from the beginning.
The churches,--he added,--may be replaced by the late ladies with canadaminists, filled with people who will not help the temple that will remain in the area.
"The vast majority of drivers who buy candamines in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why it's a fast day when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that the majority of people who go to these candymines will become the guests of these churches."
Both of the churches were built of a set of whites until Harlem became a black paradise – the Church of St. grad in 1870, the Church of Saint Martin – ten years later.
The first white beard was worn in the 1930s.
The black covering that was nearby got the right to property on the building.
The Church of Saint Martin was caught by a mob of people under the leadership of a similar John Howard Johnson, who marked a gang of gunners on the main gang in Harlem 125 street where they refused to hire or hire a witch.
The fire left the building badly damaged in 1939, but the governors under the leadership of Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put it into operation.
Similar David Johnson, son of the daughter of Johnson and his successor to the Church of Saint Martin, pride called the royal "named poor people."
The expert who played in the painting also called it "Cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical tool".
Professor Cifani Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first in the world of corals in which the artist's artist, Dianius A. Lind, who was 18 years old, went to the largest carillion in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merivezer said that in the Church of Saint Martin he was not replaced.
What happened in the Church of St. Martin in the last few months was a complex story between architects and explorers, some of whom were charged with misinformed church leaders, others Europeans.
The EPA – a managing authority composed of co-authors – wrote in EPA in a paper with a warning that the Eurasia "trys to convert outputs" to the EPA, although it did not participate in the smallest architects and assistants sent by EPA.
Some arrivals were concerned about the lack of transparency on the part of the European Union.
Acula was wounded by a 13-year-old boy at the time of the divorce of the Lobsters in California.
On Saturday the shark was attacked and wounded by a 13-year-old boy who sailed to the Lobsters in California on the day of the opening season of the Lobsters' hunting season.
An attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning on the beach of Becon-Bitch in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that the morning of the morning he had engaged with his friends for half an hour, when he heard how a boy cried, asking for help, and then drowned with the rest to help get him out of the water.
At first Hamel thought it was just a awakening from the hunting of the lobes, and then he said, "I realized that something bad had happened: "I had a taste!
I'm tired!"
"All his key was broken," said Hamel, adding that he noticed it when he came to the boy.
I called everyone to get out of the water, "In the water near the shark!" added Hamel.
The boy was transferred by air to a child's dance hall in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The phenomenon of the sharks that caused the attack is unknown.
The rescuer of Captain Larry Jailz said on the video screen that the shark was noticed in this place a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was a safe discovery.
Jailz added that patience had gained the weight of the upper part of the pit.
The citizens have closed their way to the beach from Punta Beach in Casablade to Svam in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct investigations and for safety.
Jailz noted that in this region there are more than 135 videos of sharks, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plan to move to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening up sections with the beautiful backyards in the universe where the found specialists will work.
Within the British beauty market, the price of 2.8 billion pounds of silver that continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household furniture are falling down, the more wary beauty ladies will be represented in 11 salons throughout the country and also in other new halls next year, which will be a demonstration of success.
Investments in the area of beauty come from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to fill a place in the police that were previously occupied by televisions, microcrackers and homerooms.
Sainsbury's said that to double the ranges of beauty, offering to 3,000 products, including such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which appear first.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in the federal departments like those that can be found in shops like Boots.
War goods also start their Boutique comic line, so most of the products will fit for vegans, and this trend becomes more demanding among young buyers.
In addition, the brand-new Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croatia in south London, and the second opened in Selie-Owk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Buying online and going to buy small quantities of products every day in local shops around the house will lead to more efforts by supermarkets to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupey, performing director Saninsbury's, said that wild points would be more like in the universe, because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's discotheques, Lidl using a lot of services and non-carriage gears.
Sainsbury's placed a handy dots of Argos in hundreds of stores, and also placed several Habits points from the time that two years ago came to both networks, that, he said, stopped growing sales of food products and made it more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty sections and appetites has not been completed successfully.
Sainsbury'ss was a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share income from the patents ended after a series of divisions in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after three years ago, Saninsbury's sold its appetite business along with 281 stores of Celesio's appetite network of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds of Starling.
It was announced that Lloyds played their role in this area, expanding the aortics of late brands to look after the skin, in that number La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director Sansbury's, said: "We have changed the outward appearance of our beautiful halls to improve the conditions for our clients.
We have also invested in teaching our employees who can offer their recommendations.
Our brands are designed to care for any needs, and the attractive and handy environment makes us a better home of beauty, which is opposed to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones woke up after Holly Wiluby refused to leave the department for 11 million pounds of styrlings.
Dragons De Peter Johns was released after the televisiontic Holly Wilubi refused to leave the area for 11 million pounds of starlings with his brand, which specializes in the form of life to settle on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Wilwby there's no time for the brand of return for home and Truly's accessories.
The couple business became like the brand Gwent Peltrow Goop.
Today, the 37-year-old widow announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left the Dragon's Den Peter Jones star, which is now expanding with his profitable business by creating a brand-new shop to settle in his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Johns discovered that when a girl's "silent" television came into contact with the author at his business headquarters in Marlow (Bakinghamshire), her new shares of 1.5 million pounds of Starling mean that she will no longer have enough time to take care of the house-to-house rooms and accessories of the Truly brand.
Business was similar to Gwent Peltra's Goop bridge and was doubled to double the profits of Wilubi at 11 million pounds of Starling.
When 37-year-old Willowby informed Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Johns left Great Britain and headed into one of his own restrooms.
The source reported: Truly was Holly's top priority.
It appeared to her in a long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants totally paralyzed.
No one wanted to believe what had happened in the author, very soon had to start both.
In Marlow's headquarters there's a warehouse full of rooms ready for sale.
Experts believe that this morning's educational output, which enters the largest number of British stars, can cost millions of companies due to large investments in different warehouses – from shower and candles to repairs and home furnishings, as well as from possible delays in their operation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Johns and his wife Tarry Cape for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Johns joined in the shepherding of the elders in Lovevik.
The couple are happy together, and Johns has a 40-percent share in the Bolivian television firm.
Willowby will be the M&S brand representative and replace MacPartlin's sweetness as a leading ITV "I'm a characterist".
Yesterday at night, near Jones, she said, "We won't comment on his business."
I'm sure we'll talk after we're in love.
He announced a criticism that comes from the media of mass information about his comment, which is considered "unpresiding" for what he is currently talking about as a North Korean leader.
Why is President Trup so much to refuse?
The tramp said to his Parisian "Kitarian" voice.
"I do not deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was announced by the Trappa as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks went into the hole.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korea's public prosecutor Lee Ann Ho announced to the AAN General Assembly on Saturday that the U.S. General's president was not expecting the "relevant events" in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the round of discussions.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continued to use sanctions directed at holding pressure.
The trauma took a much more optimistic position in its speech.
"We'll be very successful with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could end with her from North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have good seats now."
He said that his efforts to improve ties with Kim had resulted in significant results: completing rocket tests, helping to get the employees back home, and bringing back the Americans' savings home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"Being on the side of the president is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to fire on this whole arena, we already have about 200 people," said Trump, pointing at the crowd right before him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have dropped the islands, hundreds of people have been killed.
For example, after the earthquake on the V. Lambok, the limited illegal organizations said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lamboca has been displaced, there has been no national disaster, which is a necessary condition for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they did not turn to international aid, so it was a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbong.
He wants the Children's Education Fund and collects the command to travel to Paul until he knows if his employees are allowed to work in places.
Mr. Sutopa, the representative of the National Agency in the struggle with the Chinese disasters, said that the Indian officials are assessing the situation in Paul to find out if international agencies will be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that continue to pass through India, the country is still well prepared for the surprise of nature.
Although the Achieves had been built, they were almost nowhere in the other coastal islands.
A remarkable failure of the siren to warn about the tsunamis in Paul led to a great number of avoirs, wanting to warn and there was.
Even in the best of times, the transition between many Indonesian islands was a difficult task.
And the syllables have built up the logic of moving.
The balnician ship that was placed on the B. Lambok for the healing of the avalanche of earthquakes is near Paul, but the road to the new disaster would take at least three days.
President Jack Vidoda set up his pre-eminent campaign to improve the infrastructure of Indonesia and to spend money on car routes and skiings.
But the lack of funding is followed by Joke's administration, because next year there will be new elections.
Mr. Joke is also faced with a prolonged inter-confessive tension in Indonesia, where Muslim representatives of the majority take more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when the Christian and Muslim gangs were on the streets using swords, clubs and arrows and another cold weapon.
Look: Daniel Stage from Liverpool pushes the sword away against Chelsea
Daniel Stage saved Liverpool from the Chelsea play in Premier-Lise, reducing the number of 89 minutes on Saturday at St.ford Bridge in London.
The old man received a transfer from Jordan Shakyri, when they were about 30 meters away from the creation of Chelsea, which was large with the number 1-0.
He made a pint with a sword left of himself before making a shot in a far wall.
The attempt ended by beating high under the upper wall when the mouse flew to the right top corner of the net.
The sword, as a result, flew over the head of Cape Arbobalagh, which jumped, simply into the net.
"He just tried to get into this position to catch the sword, and such players as Shak, always tried to catch as he could go on, so I just tried to win us as much time as I could," Starj said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that running Conte, made a easy pass, not too much to think about, and just hit on the sword."
"Celsey" shouted 1:0 at the beginning of the second time after the 25th minute the Belgian star Eden Asar was killed.
Assaulting the blues on this mat he did after Matthew Kowačić, before returning to the area, and running in half of the "Liverpool" field.
The cook quickly found himself in the center of the field.
Then he made an effective hit by passing the sword of Azar back.
Asar avoided the defense and broke into the lower left corner of the next stage of the "Liverpool" boxer, Elisan Becker.
"Liverpool" comes from Naples at the Liggy Championships' group stage at 3 o'clock in the afternoon at San Paulo Stadium in Italy.
Chelsea meets with "Videoon" in Lise Europe WEFA at 3 o'clock on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832
The number of people who died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reports the Agency on the relief of the occurrence of the tsunamis in the morning.
At a press conference, the representative of Sutopo Nugroh's First Cause said that according to the messages, many people found themselves in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by the earthquake of 7.5 walls, which took place on Friday and called for an altitude of up to 7 meters.
The city of Paul, in which more than 380,000 people live, was buried in the ruins of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after they had arrested a woman.
The murder investigation was started after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhed, Mercedes.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with serious injuries in the Graysan-Muses area on the street of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspecting murder.
The police called to turn to their people from this area who saw or heard anything.
Detective Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is on an early stage, but I would like to turn to anyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhede or saw or heard anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also call on all, in particular, taxis, videomakers who may have removed some videos, to contact us because they can have information that is extremely important to our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own house.
Today's friends came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said it's in the process of informing the closest of their allies.
The taxi driver who lives in Graysan-Muses just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The living room now says it's going to be a few more hours before they're allowed to come back.
The police explained to one man that the whole paradise is now a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene.
She said, "That's so bad."
At 14:00, two police forums were located in a curved perimeter, another forum was outside.
A number of police officers were standing inside the perimeter following a multiquarious building.
Everyone who has the information must contact @MerPolCC police department, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously by number 0800 555 111, calling 247 out of 30 witnesses.
The Parliamentary Statute of Cromwell has become the last anniversary of the "recording of history".
His removal would be a poetic justice for him, like the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, welcomed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
"But Cromwell's Tafary described the proposal of Mr. Creek as "study" and "test to re-write the story".
John Goldsmith, the mayor of the Cromville Palace, said: In the course of the current debate on the demolition of the status, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's memory around the Westminster Palace would become the subject of these actions.
The iconacies of English civil wars were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps evil Cromwell will be brought into the cave for his probation of Thomas in the previous year.
The clear presentation of Mr. William Hama Tornacroft about Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the story of the event, which many think should be discussed.
Mr. Goldsmith said The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people know from the end of the 19th century better than today as Parliament's defense from outside pressure, in his case it was a manarchy.
This is a completely accurate presentation, the subject of long-term historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognized figure that represents one of the sides of this conflict.
His achievements as a Lord-Protector also deserve to be marked and renounced."
The priest-in-law has led to the death of a Chinese farmer.
As local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southern China.
"The man who knows only by the way, Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and a bloody blood, beside the bread on the market of Lupanshi in Guyche's law," reported the South China Post Sunday newspaper.
The Swinwava was charged with bringing a pig vaccine into the Chinese province of China on May 30, 2005.
It is reported that he, along with his brother-in-law, came from a neighboring June to sell 15 coins on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring newspaper was opened.
He said that there was a big nose with blood on the chest in the kitchen.
According to the report, the medical expert confirmed that the 550-kilogram-kilogram-knife had left the farm.
"My brother's legs were torn and damaged," said the uncle from the Vow saying (by quoted Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the camera showed that John went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour ago.
An animal that had killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his beloved brother.
The market manager informed Evening News that the candle was closed to prevent the attack on anyone else while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The message, the family of Yuan and the market administration will hear a talk about compensation for his death.
Even if the pigs attack people, they're rare, but they've been before.
Yes, in 2016 the wedding attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man's getting serious injuries.
Ten years ago, the weight of 650 pounds pushed a Valian farmer to his tractor and kept it until his wife stopped the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Aragon was brought together by his candles in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a drop-off crack.
"They're just funny.
They're curious and very curious... they don't want to harm anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect," he said.
The Roses will take a strong drop of rain to the south west of the United States.
It's a forecast, the rose is weak because it's moving over the more cold waters of the northern part of Mexico.
However, the next day Rosa will take the lead in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States.
Roza's speed, at category 1, consisted of 85 million hours per hour at 5 o'clock in the morning of the East Time on Sunday, and was set at 385 miles south west of Punta Ewhenia in Mexico.
'Roza', as expected, goes to the end of the week.
In the middle of the ocean, it begins to form a low pressure area moving east to the west coast of the U.S.. When, on Monday, the South California coast is approaching, in the face of a tropical storm, it starts to push the deep-stairs to the south west of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will take up in some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches.
And then the tropical storm, which flows from the surrounding area of the lower pressure, calls the most powerful waves on the south-west.
Spaces from 1 to 4 inches of abducts call dangerous sudden flooding, landfills, and possible flooding in the desert.
A deep, deep-rooted abundance will lead to the number of places to reach 2-3 full in an hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the north-west, especially in most of Arizona, is expected to be 2 to 4 generations of the continents.
As a result of the clustered parts of the tropical rainforests, there may be a sudden turn of events, under the conditions of a rapid deterioration of the conditions.
It would be very unlikely to go out in the desert because of the risk of tragic accidents.
A strong rain can lead to the canyons to turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be subjugated by the periphery wind and dust.
The surrounding area of low pressure will bring a strong rain in the southern California border.
Possible summary cases more than on-the-fly can lead to an insignificant flow of moisture and make smooth paths.
It's going to be the first lion in the addendum season.
Some scattered tropical rains begin to approach Arizona at the end of the week and at the beginning of the Monday before the rain comes all over at the end of the Monday and in the autumn.
A strong rain will spread in the area of the Four Towers in the desert and will continue to fall.
In the refrigerator, you can watch the strong temperature changes in the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropicals remain warm enough.
This sometimes leads to a sudden change in temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of a rare temperature change in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missuri) and Amahia (Netherlands), St. Louis and De-Mayan (Ayova), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try to cool and grow again.
It is expected that in many of the central and eastern states of the United States, temperatures will begin to warm up from 80 degrees south to the part of the North-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees in the author, which is about 10 degrees higher in the middle.
Our long term climate forecast shows the high probability of higher temperatures in the east of the United States to the first half of the drought.
More than 20 million people were watched listening to Bretta Kawan.
More than 20 million people on six television networks were watching interesting testimony on Thursday in the Supreme Court of Justice between Brett Kavan and Christian Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was intended to take place in the 1980s.
At the same time, political opposition continues, the majority of them have banned their regular programs for the use of the extraordinary news on Friday: a memorial prepared by the Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck for the FBI: it was designed to conduct a weekly investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was 100 percent sure that the drunk Cavan had caught her and tried to download her from her late evening at the senior school.
Kawana, in her mild testimony, said that 100% sure it wasn't.
Apparently, more than 20.4 million people who reported to Nielsen's company on Friday looked at him.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not available immediately for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen's company, it's usually a problem with an honest person who's watching TV in the office.
To compare: The size of the audience is the same as when playing in play-off or Oscar's prime.
"The Fox News channel, which experts recently supported the appointment of Kawan, led all networks in the middle of 5.69 million viewers all day," said Nielsen.
ABC took another location with 3.26 million viewers.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million," said Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after listening.
Flyk was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the death toll of the republican prosecutor's office announced that he would vote in support of Cavana, he was beaten by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when the Protestants shouted at his address and when he tried to lift the lift to the hearing at the Court's committee.
He stood with his left eye for a few minutes when he was lying down, and it passed into the straight ephemeral on the CNN channel.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"What do you think, he says the truth of the country?
And they said unto him, Thou hast both power and authority: but many women have power over her.
Flyk said his office had published a statement, and informed him before the elevator closed, that he still had to say something about the committee's hearings.
All cables and wholesale networks had a couple of hours to pass through when the Court's committee had to vote on the election of the Kavan candidate at the Seine Square.
But Flyk said what to do, just knowing that the FBI will consider the defendants against the candidate for the next week, to which the democracies call the minority.
Flyk was surrounded by partial speakers with his friend, senator-democrates, Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kunsa and several senators, Flyk made a decision.
The election of Flake was strong, because it was obvious that there would be no votes in the Republicans to confirm Cavan without investigation.
President Trump began investigating charges against Kawana in the FBI.
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom My blame for the "police in politics" for the brexitis
While interviewing the newspaper Sunday Times Prime Minister Teresa, my lawyer accused me of leaving the European Union, that they're "playing politics" with the future of Britain and attracting national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tersha, came to the Conference of the Conservative Party at the British Birmingham on 29 July 2018.
In an interview with her at the first floor of the newspaper, she was the minister of the closed office of Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "shocking" plan on the brake, saying that it was proposed that Britain and the EC had one tariffs, was "all wrong."
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested a suspect in the death of the LSU Dayton Simpson.
The police fired a death shot at Waida Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the command of the University of Louisiana.
"The 20-year-old Dayton Simpsan was arrested and placed in a tower on charges of murder at a second stage," reported the police leader Baton-Ruj.
The journalists showed the video of the shooting between Sims and Simpsan, and the police said Sims lost the sharks during the shooting.
"The police took the sharks from the scene and said that they were exposed to the DNA Simpson," reports WAFB, CBS.
After a question, the Simpson police said that he had admitted to a deadly shooting in Wade.
“The deposit fee is set at $350,000,” reports Advocate.
The next amendment of the East Baton-Russia published on Friday the previous report, which states that the cause of death is a head and tail fire.
The department of the state police station in Louisiana, the state's criminal police lab, the South University police are asking the residents of the area for help in investigating which would stop the attack.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Aleva, thanked the legal authority of the region for the "extremeability and effort to justice".
Simsu was only 20 years old.
As he grew up at 6 feet old in Baton-Rug, where his father Wayne also played in basketball under the command of the University of Louisiana.
In the middle of the last season, he collected 5.6 points, 2.6 points for the game.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Way, said that the command was "sustained" and "in shock" from the death of Wade.
"That's what I always worry about," said Wade.
Volcano off the coast of Mexico
The populace, which is made up of the volcano of the Papcatpetella, reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The national centre for warning of the tsunami on Saturday offered Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crash and for 24 hours 183 cases of gas and dust were recorded.

Police interview with Catholic separatists prior to the vote on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the volunteers had met with the police on the streets of the public order, and thousands of others had joined the demonstration in replacing the first thought of the Parisian vote on the Catalan division.
A group of spies were in masks that were kept by the police on the streets of the public order, left their eggs and blown up a parachute, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fight was won when the police used their doubts to keep the demonstrators.
For several hours, a group of fighters for independence scheduled for "Don't forget, don't give up," met with the prosthetics who shouted, "Life Spain".
As for local press messages, fourteen people have gone through some sort of sort of tragedy that has occurred during the trial.
The tension in the region that seeks to be independent remains high over a year after the referendum of one of the judges, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which marked Catholics as separatists.
The electors in the vast majority were far from being independent, although the wings of the electors were low, which in a significant way were understood by the polling blocs.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in the summer after the police tried to stop voting at the polls throughout the region as a result of the acts of the dissidents.
Groups that are independent have been held on Friday night to promote demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the prosecutors were forced to go another way.
68-year-old Narciss Hermes, an electric who attends a separatist procession with his wife, said that he no longer relies on the prospect of gaining the independence of the Catalans.
"A year ago we passed one of the best moments.
I saw how my parents cried out with joy when they could vote, but now we are tired," he said.
In spite of the importance of life, but a small change in the regional elections in the snow last year, Catholic parties who are independent tried to keep the momentum in this year with many of their most famous leaders and found themselves either in favor of or in disappointment, waiting for the court to organize the referendum and the next announcement of independence.
42-year-old Jan Puch, who writes a statement in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was handled by politicians from both sides.
He said, “Be all excited.”
On Saturday, Ariel Junckers, one of nine Catholic leaders who are in SIZA from the end of last year, announced that they would participate in elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The election as a candidate for European elections is the best way to justify the regression of democratic values and repressions we have seen from the Spanish authorities," he said.
The Londoners: Men taken after being treated at home on a car
Three men in the age of 33, 34 and 39 were kidnapped after their car suddenly stopped at home in London.
The incident took place in the Belingrad-Cresent area at 4:30 p.m. in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said that it was damaged by the bridge and the building itself.
There may have been a bullet in the car at some point.
As a result of Manga's hit, Lovingstan's victory over Rangers' number 1:0
First Valley of Mangy for the benefit of Lvivingstan assured him of victory
The success of Livingstone's game was rangers, and it was a trap to appoint Steven Gerard after he had several matches in 18 games on behalf of the Ibrox Club's manager.
The Dolly Mangy strike was great because Harry Holt rose up at one level with the Hibernates in the second division.
Commander Gerard won't get out in the Premier League this season, and the next week he'll meet with the leader, Commander Harts, who'll stay at eight points.
To this Rangers in Lisie Europe is taken into four vescal vesicles répid.
"Lovingstan," at that time, continued his unplayed series in a division to six games, and chief coach Holt still feels right after Kenya Miller's replacement in the past month.
Lvivingstan misses the chance of being a big visitor
The Holta command must have warned long before they were killed, but such a call called the Rangers problem.
Scott Robinson stopped, but lost his chance to kill in the bridge, after which Alan Lettow was able to only direct his noble width to meet the attacks of Craig Halket.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play before them, knowing that they might worry about the guest at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
On the edge of the Rangers, a strike was allowed, and Lvivingstan sent a bomb, Deklan Galler and Robinson together to cross Mango, who made a pass and killed from the center of the field.
To this point, Rangers' domaind, but it was found that the defense of the command was ineffective, and Liam Kelly's cousin was practically not involved
That was still going on in the second half, though Alfred Marelius really saved Kelly.
The sword from Scott Pitman was depicted by the Ranger's novel by Alan McGregarm, and Litgos came from the second "Levengstan".
The sword continued to be found in the "Livegstan" bridge and was displayed, while as two request panels, after the Halquet was called on to replace Glenn Middleton, and the demand for a hand-hake was dismissed.
"Fenomene" from "Levengstan" - analysis
BBC Scotland Journalist Alessdeier Lamant at Arne Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal productivity and results for "Lovingstan".
For men they were wonderful, continuing to wait on this emerging trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed from the moment they returned to the upper corner, but should give the appropriate Holt for how he stimulated the command from the moment he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was generous, building a well-organized defense while Menga held Connor Goldsan and Joe Ural all over the field.
Rangers didn't get any inspiration.
As good as they weren't with Gerard, they didn't meet these standards.
In the last match, they didn't have a match, just once they killed in a fight, which was some kind of worrying call for Rangers, which was found in the middle of the list.
Moves flat review to the next item in the list.
On Saturday, 29th of January, there was a smile and a feeling of empty flying when the Turkish and German mailmen met at the Berlin breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's final visit to Germany, which led to the renewal of relations between NATO allies.
They have dealt with human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdagan was headed to Cologne to open a new giant game.
In this city, the largest number of Turkish population in Turkey is living outside the borders of Turkey.
The police sent for security measures not to give a crowd of 25,000 people to gather before the battle, but a number of officers were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of traitors against Erdagana, many of whom were traitors, also expressed their reasoning, judging both the politicality of Erdagana, and the decision of the German court to welcome him to the country.
The prosecutors for and against show the differences between the guest, which one of the German Turks informed the hero, and the other judge as an autocrat.
DTS in Deptfarde: The driver is missing when dealing with the car
The driver died as a result of a car crash in London.
The accident took place around the streets of Bejjjed Street and Evelin Street, the road opened in Deptfarde, on the south-west of the city, such as at 10:15 in the British time.
The driver stopped, the workers arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident took place a few months after another terrorist died as a result of an encounter on the Childers Street, such as in a mile from the location of the Saturday camp.
The static police said their employees were working to get to know the man and to tell him about his closest friend.
There are bus stops and bus stops around that place, and car drivers have been advised to avoid this area.
LongLarten Tower: Six employees injured during the riots
"Six tourist workers have been hit by a set of man-to-men riots," reports the Penitentiary Survey.
The expeditions took place in the Long Larzyn Tower in Upper Brittany at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday, and continued on the roof.
To fight the riots in which the eight wounded were held in one wing, the Tarnada Spectrum was launched.
In the workplace, workers have suffered from severe traumas.
The representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "A special trained Turkish personnel were directed to fight those who had done the Long Larsin tour.
Six employees went through the race after they got hit.
We're not strung by violence in our communities, and we've understood that we'll be sent to the police and we can spend more time with the thieves."
The Royal Tower of Long Larsin contains more than 500 wounded, some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the tour had passed through the bath after an attack by a wounded man.
And in the past year, police officers on the streets of the public order have been called into the market to deal with serious irregularities during which workers have been subjected to attacks by the windmills.
The Rosary is threatened by the garden of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong waves (which can be useful for the dry regions)
Tropical injuries rarely occur in Arizona, but this is what may happen at the beginning of the next week, because there are traces of Roza's infection in the south-west part of the desert that involve the risk of sudden seizures.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on recent developments in West Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, South-East California and South, in that number in the ranks of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Roza's author will go straight through Phenix, approaching the dinner at midnight.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix pointed out in Twitter that only “ten of the tropical cyclones have caused a fatal storm or a drop of pressure within 200 million of Phoenix since 1950!
Catrina (1967) was injured 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona.
The last model of the National Center for Diseases is expected to fall from 2 to 4 purposes, while in individual places it can reach 6 places in the region of Magalion in Arizona.
On the other side of the south-west desert, in that number of central rocks and the Great Basins, it's likely to fall from 1 to 2 goals, with these individual results can reach 4 goals.
For those who are outside the risk of sudden behaviour, the Rosary could be prolonged because their regions are covered by drought.
Although the behavior is a very serious problem, some of these events are likely to be beneficial, because in the south-west of the present time, droughts are being watched.
The U.S. agency's data on the monitoring of droughts, taking a little over 40 percent of Arizona's territory to survive the extraordinary drought of another category," reports weather.com.
First of all, the route of the Roza hurricane will lead to the discovery of the Gulf of South California on the Mexican island of Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of the hurricane with the maximum wind at 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Ewchenia in Mexico, and moves at full speed 12 miles per hour.
The heat comes with more cold water in the Pacific and that's why it's cold.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm strikes, there will be a river out of the mountains by day or by night in the afternoon.
Cases in various parts of Mexico may be strong, creating a significant risk of seizure.
"The total number of cases is expected from 3 to 6 from Lower California to the north-west Sanlera, where possible cases to 10," reports weather.com.
Then Ruja will move across Mexico in the face of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning, in the face of a tragic fall of pressure, which will then continue to move through Arizona and the southern part of the state of Yuta to the author's evening.
"The main danger is expected from "Ross" or its fate, it is very strong in Lower California and northwestern Sanor and South-East US," the National Centre of Urgans reported.
They are expected to lead to danger to life and sudden behaviour and village flows and wake up in the upper room.
A father in Midsammer Norton: four attempted to build a killer
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were shot in the face of a murder attempt after finding a 16-year-old body with the idea of a serious injury in Summersett.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the area of Theraj Exselsier in Midsammer Norton about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was put in a hospital where he remained in a "stable" state.
"The 17-year-old boy and both other, 18 and 20-year-olds, were shot at night in the Radstok, Evon and Samerset," the police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone what happened to move forward in their search.
"Someone steals from the territory and the anger of the Democratic Party," said Trump.
"A vote for Judge Cavano is a vote for the rejection of the Dmacratic Party's arbitrary and arbitrary tactics," said Trip on the street in Wiling, East Virginia.
The tramp said that Cavano's "scared from the ground and the rage" of the Democratic Party during the process of selecting him on the post.
Cavano gave the statements before Congress in Thursday, intensively and campaigning against Christine Blaise Ford's accusation that he had sexually raped her for ten years when they were still in prison.
Ford also gave a statement during her hearings about her accusation.
On Saturday, the President said that "the Americans had seen blizzards, beautiful and brave characters" in Cavano.
"A voice in support of the Kawani Court is one of the most successful experts in the rule of law in our time, the right to a great history of state service," he said to a crowd of Western citizens.
The president briefly referred to the Kawano election, discussing the importance of the Republicans' struggle in the period of interlocutory elections.
"Five weeks remained to one of the most major elections of our time.
I do not know but I know."
"That's why I always win for great candidates."
The trap is unacceptable that the Democrats intend to "stop and break".
"It is expected that the first key process vote at the sequential level on the Kavanovo election will take place not later than Friday," the senior assistant of the CNN Parliament announced.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of people who are suffering from old age
"At least 384 people have been killed, many have disappeared as a result of the influence of giant waves on the beaches when on the Indian island of Solaves the fighting earthquakes and tsunamis began," the government said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the beach in Paul's town on Friday, when they fell up at six feet (18 feet) white on the shores, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
After the quake, the magnetism of 7.5 has occurred with tsunamis.
"When the tsunamis were threatened yesterday, the people were still on the beach and not immediately escaped, and they became a fugitive," said the president of the Indonesian agency in a briefing at Jakarte on the relief of the disaster at Sutopo First Nugroho.
"Cunami took the car, the rails, the houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km /h (up to 497 km /h) before the strike on the coastal line.
According to his words, some people survived only because they fell on trees to escape from the tsunamis.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Paul.
The aerospaces, published by the Czech disaster agencies, showed that many buildings and goods were destroyed, the masses ran and broke, and the match was surrounded by water.
The next spring continued to climb the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy generated by a powerful earthquake on Friday, for example, 200 times exceeds the power of an atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow hole, could increase the size of the tunnels.
The thief called the damage a "great" and reported that thousands of houses, balsams, cave centers and the hotel were destroyed.
According to his words, the bodies of some avoirs were found under the clouds of broken buildings, adding that 540 people got wounded, and 29 died without news.
"Ahevers and damages can be the longest length of a coastal line of 300 km (190 km) to the whole of Paul, the area called Dongula, which is closer to the center of the earthquake," Nugroh said.
Dongula's relationship "was completely damaged," Nugroha said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," says the Red Cross, adding that its workers and volunteers have been led into a long-term paradise.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be very bitter," he said.
On Saturday, the agency criticized the fact that they didn't report the tsunamis in Paul, but the prosecutors said that they had arrived at the time when a warning was made.
In amateur photos published on social networks, you can hear how a man on the top of the building shouts people in the street a warning of the tsunami.
After a few minutes, the water wall fell on the shore, pulling behind its buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the validity of the removal of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis called for a serious decommissioning of electricity that had damaged communications around Paul, so the government had a hard time altering rescue operations.
According to the U.S. soldiers, they started driving freight planes with the help of Jackart and other garages, but the evacuated still needed food and other items of first need.
The city airport was opened only for assistance and will be closed to the earthquake.
On Sunday, President Jack Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Paul.
As a result of tsunamis in Indonesia, the loss of more than 800 people
It's very bad.
"While the workers of the World Vision from Dingala have successfully returned to the city of Paul, where the workers are hiding in the fireplaces set up in their offices on the road, they have seen the detonation scenes," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began their efforts to start relief arrangements in times of disaster, some complained that the disabled workers who are mastering deep knowledge refuse to go to Paul.
In accordance with the Indian rules, funding, supplies and personnel outside the border can only begin to progress if the place of disaster is covered by a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a real disaster," said Auriya Arriani, president of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After saying, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international assistance, but this status is not yet.
On the second night in Paul, after the earthquake and the tsunamis on Friday, friends and family of the missing without news hoped that their nearby miracle would be among those who would leave the unfathomable parallel lines of the Pacific disaster.
On Saturday the little boy was released from canalization.
On Sunday, the soldiers fired a woman who had been in the ruins for two days, and her baby’s body was next to her.
Hendon Subbandon, a trainer of the Indian National Command for Parapelanism, prepared two of the missing parapellets for Asian games that were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandage, in that number and others who were in the past at Roa Roa's hotel, were his students.
"As the oldest in the eye of parapolarism, I have my own competitive burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told about how a couple of hours after the co-planners had spread news about the distribution of Roa Roa's hotel, he quietly sent messages to whatsApp's attendees of the Palu, who were on the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked by a series of voices, not by two signs.
"This means that messages were not received," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while filling the bankamates in Newport on the left

Kenny West: Reper changed his name to Ye ('t').
Reper Kenya West has changed its name to Ye.
Speaking of a change in his name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I'm officially aware of it as Kenya West.
West, 41, minus Ye, used this minibus as a name for its eight album, which went out in June.
Changes occur prior to his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where, as expected, he starts his new Yandhi album.
He replaced the song by Ariana Grande on the show, which changed for "Amazian reasons," said the show's creator.
Similarly, by cutting off his current professional name West said earlier that this word has a religious value for him.
I believe that "yes" is a very common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "that," said West at the beginning of this year, killing the name of the album with the happy Big Boy.
So, I--it's you, I--it's us, it's all us
It's from Kenya, which means "one", to just yes," is a picture of our good, our bad, our loss, everything.
Album is more than a picture of who we are.
He was one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that it refers to the names of Love and Brother Love.
He was an employee of Westa, Jay-Zie, who also lived without a connection and the main letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against peaceful giants
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Abrador, has never used the military force against the population, since the country is about 50 years old since the day of the bloody repression against the students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza Lopes Abrador's lovers "never use fighters to divide the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the floor, resulting in the death of about 300 people, while left students were killed throughout Latin America.
Lopes Abrador loves to support young Mexicans, giving each month's subsidies to those who learn to open the most free places in state universities.
"The unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
U.S. needs to double-dependencies in the machine
"To the extent that China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research in this branch," says a Key-Fu Lee, a computer scientist who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments appeared after the various parts of the U.S. government made statements about ME, even if in the U.S. there is no official MI strategy.
In the meantime, in the past year China has presented its plan: by 2030, it will try to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
"Adequate the budget to research in the MY area would be a good start, considering that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we are waiting for the next break in the MY area," said Lee.
"Adequate funding may double the probability of what the next major MY achievement is in the United States," LI said to the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The State of Car Intelligence: China, the Cyclone Valley and the New World Council" was published in this month by Houston Miflin Harcourt, is the leading executive director of the Synovation Ventures company, who invested in one of the most famous MI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Melana he worked on a machine intelligence system that enabled him to overcome the very high-ranking American player Atella, and later he was the director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google department in China.
Lee admitted to the former professional technical associations of the United States, such as the Agency's employment unions, through a previous research project in the defense branch, and asked whether it would be next to help identify the following screens.
"A U.S. investigators often have to work hard to get state loans," Li said.
"It's not China that collects academic leaders; it's corporation," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in the last few years have bought candles from universities to work on MI.
Li said that changing the immigration policy could also help the United States to push its efforts into the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, green cards must be offered automatically to candidates in the MI branch," he said.
The State Council of China issued a plan for the development of the machine intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
"The National Fund for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, such as the National Sciences Fund and other state organizations, for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created the United States Machine Intelligence Centre, in which partners from industry and science courses should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Intelligence Company.
And in this month, the Agency, through a previous research project in the defense branch, announced an investment of $2 billion under the name AI Next.
With regard to the National Science Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than 100 million dollars a year in MI research.
In the meantime, U.S. warrants, which tried to create the National Security Commission by means of a machine, did not monitor actions for several months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in favour of a referendum to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for a ten-year dispute with Greece, which called for a call for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has Macedonia's jurisdiction, asserts that the name of its northern neighbour represents its presence on its territory, and has made a call for entry into NATO and EC.
In June two hours, a section was closed with the proposed new name, but nationalist workers claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian population of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said that he would not vote for the referendum, and the company of the poll raised doubts as to whether the election will be due to at least 50 percent, which is necessary for the referendum to be held.
The question of voting on the referendum suggests: "You are members of NATO and EC with a remembrance from Greece".
The president of the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's office, in this regard, asserts that it is the cost to be paid for by a host of bodies such as EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to proclaim for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a more secure life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievsky, 79 years old, Skopje.
Although this is not a necessary legal force, enough Members of Parliament said that they would count the results of voting to make it decisive.
The change in the name requires more than two losses in Parliament.
The state electoral commission stated that it did not arrive until 1 hour after the day of the cancellation.
However, the threshold was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old ex-commissioner José Tanewski.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaew, his wife Zarez and his son Douche announced after the referendum in Macedonia, a sworn change in the name of the country, which opens the way for her entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 July 2018.
Before Parliament's building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkos had rented a small scene and painted a chair in front of the halls set up by those who would block the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to meet with the heads raised, not through the service door," Kavardak said.
"We are a poor country, but we have honour.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO's companies will make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think that the average number will be "to", because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that as a result, "that" would be "a confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Investigations, it is said that in the referendum, 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary threshold.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian telephony showed 57 percent of the respondents who planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-seven percent said they said they'd say "yes."
For a successful referendum, there must be 50 percent plus one voice.
Failure in the referendum will be the first serious strike by the former governor's policy since his arrival in the course of the past year.

The artist wants to play the role of the pick-up points against the Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the play-off competitions, there was no special reason to publish a new start.
But the constant competitive Sherzer is hoping to get himself hit on Sunday against "Calarad Rocky", but only when there are still play-offs for Rocky, who remain in charge after a game with "Los-Angeles Dogers" in the North West.
At least the years have taken notice of a unique place with the number 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their first round in the division.
"Even though we play just like that, at least, we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and the other stones will be so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I've met this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be in this assembly?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start on Sunday, but, as reported, they are willing to give the Chercher a sword in such a situation.

The trumpet will sound in the Western Hemisphere
The president hurriedly referred to the situation around his election of the Supreme Court of Brete Cavano, referring to the importance of the struggle of the Republicans in the interim elections.
"All we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most major choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big ones - I don't know, and I really do, so I'm always fighting for the big candidates," he said.
The trumpet continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, see what's happening now.
And they're determined to return their power using any necessary means, you see, the area, the measure.
They're all equal to what they're saying, which they have to do to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to his words, democracies have the intention "to stop and stop."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "bad, bad, rebellious and stupid."
He appealed to the Senate's judicial committee for the continued recognition of Senator of the democratic group, Jean Fainstein, who received a sound assessment from the auditor.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you allow this document to be deleted?
No, that's it.
No, I don't expect it -- it was a very bad language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer a fundamental church.
It's impatient for those who say their intentions.
If the Momentum activists in my local party were complaining about me to argue, it was probably a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of the members of the parliament from the Liberian party who say that we are not welcome, all to express their concern.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar response because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
In my case the censor was critical of me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, about Europe, on the irony of the forest, such questions as which Germany did not agree with the previous leaders.
The post post of the meeting, which was held on Friday in Nottingham, the Eastern Liberian Party, said that "we want these meetings to be local and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Liberian Party of Manavit such meetings were on Friday
Unfortunately, today's most meeting of the tone isn't like that and the promise of 'more good, softer' politics has long forgotten if it ever was.
This becomes even more apparent that in the Liberian party different views are not allowed, and every measurement is evaluated on this side of the view, whether it is the primary for party leadership or not.
It began soon after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues with whom I once thought I shared a number of political views began to expect me to take a step back, and took positions with which I would never agree - on national security issues or on a single EU market.
Every time I make public statements -- and that doesn't mean what I'm saying -- in social networks, there's a tragedy now that calls for the rejection of the elections, judging the policy of the center, saying that I'm no longer in the Party of Liberia.
And it's not just my experience.
Actually, I know that I've missed more than some of my colleagues, because the comments that led to me as a rule are political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and the determination of those colleges that are dealing with the flow of sexual or racist drugs every day, but they never get involved.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this age of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said that the Liberian Party should develop a culture of talent.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that supports different views, and with every movement of uncertainty or change of party rules, it becomes more difficult.
For the last two years, I've been given many tips that have called me not to give a spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Leibarista 32 years ago as a school student, responsible for the rape of the Thatter office, since my education in school has been successfully settled, I have tried to hold the best government services for those who have more than I need -- let it be a local resident or a government minister.
I've never lost my political views, in that regard in the past.
No one in the East Nottingham could ever be locked up in my political positions and areas of disillusionment with the current leadership.
For those who have succeeded in this move on Friday, I would like to say that, when the country is headed to Brexit, which is causing damage to the housekeepers, the presidents and our state service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in fact the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it is my electoral, whether it will be the members of the lobbyists, or not: I respect what I serve you, and I promise that no threat of rejection of the elections will not and political consent will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Air Melrovs 38 - 17: Immanuable Air at the top
Two later attempts may have been told a few final results, but, of course, Eir deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting matte of the Tennt's prime minister.
Now they're setting a tournament table, one side of ten.
In the end, it was their greatest defense, as well as their best chances that their masters had done, the coach Peter Death had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've still tried our games until now, and we're still not able, so I have to be happy," he said.
The Rabbit of Melrous said, "Give me the proper Eiro, he was more concerned than we are.
The 14-minute experiment by Grant Anderson, transformed by Fraser Clima, put Ireland in a preliminary plan, but a yellow map for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the game Warriors, allowed Melrous to multiply the numbers, and Jason Baggott got caught up in an unrealistic attempt.
Climate extended the leadership of Ira with the aid of a pen, before, right at the stop, he killed, and then made a solo attempt by making 17-5 Ira a stop.
But Melrows well began the second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who was transformed into the Bagot, cut off the distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruirid Nott, which had been delayed, and after the reboot of Eir, he moved further through the test of Stafford McDouale, realized by Climus.
Er, performing the duties of Captain Blair McFerson, received a yellow card, and again Melrouss forced another man to pay with an unrealistic attempt by Bruce Colwin at the end of the cold pressure.
However, the gentlemen returned, and when Straan Hatchensan received a yellow card for what he had stolen the climate without a sword from the line of writing, Mcfersan landed behind the Ira.
The climate realized its attempt to do what he did almost again after the reboot, after that Kyle Roy got David Armstrong's hit in the stairwell and sent Gregor Henry's flag on the fifth attempt of the master of the field.
Still Game star, similar to a new career in a restored business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter the hotel business industry after it was discovered that it was intended for a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes, and meets with a long comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
Two reported that the next nine series would be the last in the series of shows, and it seems that Kernan is planning to move on after Craiglong.
As for the official records, it's the Afförmorn Limited directory.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kernan would take part in the "Vulnerable Gandley in Glazga".
'Our Sea': Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will again open the way to the Pacific
The maroons are patrolling the war-marine headquarters in La Pase.
The urban buildings under the black roof.
In the war-marques from the Pacific Ocean and the Amazon, it is reduced by "The Sea is our right".
Again, that's our obligation.
In all Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, remember the coastal line lost by Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century, still alive, as well as the attempt to refish the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the maximum level in the last decade, since Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on 1 October following five years of discussion.
"Balvinia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course she is waiting for a permanent outcome," said the Bolivian diplomat Robert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision of the MS on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Gaza Tribunal, after decades of forced protests, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is required to hear talks about the submission of Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Marales is a charismatic president of Bolivia who is faced with a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of June.
But some analysts think that the court will either decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and it's a little bit different, even if it does.
The AAN organization, based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide on the Chilean territory and said that it will not determine the origin of possible transfers.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is only six months after the final arguments have been considered testifies to the fact that the case was "not complicated," said a Swiss expert in the field of international law Paz Zaraté.
And far from passing the affairs of Bolivia, the last four years may have left her behind.
"The problem of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her words, Maralise's nephew lost the final universal kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after this discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not been replaced by messages.
Former President Edward Radrüez Velce, Bolivia's representative in Gaza, gave up the idea that the decision of the court was unusually quick.
The Monday will take the Bolivian "exclusive opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility "the end of 139 years has been different from each other," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Marales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the Maralese problem as a political challenge.
"The disease never refuses its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"Restances is the opportunity to see what we need to change the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can't trust the United States
The Prime Minister of North Korea R. Young Ho says that his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Riy spoke on Saturday at the AAN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments are coming like the US. The director Mike Pampe's, like, is at the end of the renewal of the nuclear tupic press with the North-Korean Kim Chen's son more than three months after Singapore.
Ray says it's an "impotent sea," to continue sanctions and the United States to oppose the declaration of the end of the war in Korea that has never been put on its knees again.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration, if Phinyan does not begin to take significant steps after the divorce.
And Kim, and president of the U.S. Donald Trump, need a second summit.
But there is great scepticism besides that Phinyan is seriously opposed to the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pampea plans to visit Pyongyan next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
In the Persian fashion show we saw the newest line in the massive main collections on the way to the sale in your gardens.
If you want to enlarge your collection of capillaries or completely close the sun, you can no longer search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne represented a number of extraordinary main assemblies for their SS19 collection, which extended waiting from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, in Instagram, the popularity of non-practicable hats was announced by designers who sent their animals to the podium.
Valentino's remarkable rice was a fragile yellow hat, decorated with broad leaves, similar to those filled with heads of models.
Other axles of an unusual size included decorated precious stones of cotton, capturing the artist and even annas, but they were not designed to keep their head warm.
That Brown also showed a bunch of smart masks -- like once to Halloween.
Many of the cataclysmic masks were with closed lips and reminded Ganibal Lectera more than a higher fashion.
One of them reminded me of a boat to sail with a sailor and a sailor, and the other is like a seagoing rabbit.
And if you're going to continue to hold on to the great attributes of fashion, you've been disappointed.
Those who look at the style, predict that big hats can go through our everyday life.
The great size caps go five to La Bomba, the salamander capillary with a field wide in two feet, which can be seen in all, from Riana to Emily Ratikowski.
The cultural label on a very unhandled hat that was launched on social networks, stopped at another large animal for help -- a salty beach bag, almost as big as a model from this bag, prepared in a buyer.
A dark-and-sharp bag of raffiy, an excavated canal of raffy and covered with a white black handle, became a part of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 in the Thai fashion in Paris.

John Edward: Learning languages is a necessary lesson for all citizens of the world
Independent Shatland schools have achieved academic success since 2018 with yet another excellent result of exams, which are supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other societies.
More than 30,000 students throughout Chatland, schools presented by the Schleland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to train their students to continue higher education, choose their careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you talk to him in his native language, it will go to his heart."
It's a clear reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
As a result of the last exams this year, we see that languages take the first place in the bed tables with the highest figures in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who learned limited languages received a higher score of A.
The data collected at 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher class A in Chinese learning, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent were French, and 63 percent were Spanish, also reached a level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support complex languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
The language as an object is now selected as the same as the STEM objects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the educational programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Technology Commission in 2014, showed that among the reasons that workers have been subjected to difficulties in filling the vacancy, 17 percent have been linked to a lack of language skills.
So more and more linguistic skills become necessary to prepare young people for future careers.
With the care of more prospective workplaces that need to know languages, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Depending on who's a profession to choose when you learn another language, in the future it's a real priority if you're going to master such skills all over the world.
The ability to contact people from other countries automatically puts a lot of people at the top of the competition.
According to YouGov's application, in 2013, more than 4,000 adult Britons were unable to speak well enough in a limited language, while French was the only language in which two-thirds of them were speaking 15 percent.
That's why investment in language education is now important for children today.
The complexity of a number of languages, especially in developing countries, has given children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland each school will be distinguished by the languages it has.
The school is based on more classical modern languages, while others will speak languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandatory or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, in independent schools, there will always be a choice of several languages with a vocabulary that is specialists in this branch.
The Shatland Independent Schools strive to ensure the education environment that will enrich the children and count their skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what will happen in the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global language environment, life is still important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered as “arts of international relations”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and priority to young Shatlandi.
This must be done

Lebron's due Sunday in San Diego.
The beginning of waiting for the volunteers who want to see Lebron James made his first start at Los Angeles Lakes.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton reported that James seems to be on the front door last week against "Denver Nagets" in San Diego.
But for a few minutes he's playing, he's still got to figure out.
"It will be more than one and less 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Correspondent Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James would probably play in a limited time.
In harmony with the practice that took place this week, James was asked about his plans for "six game-playing charts".
"I don't need preconceived games at this stage of career to prepare," he said.
How often to use the trampa in the West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight at Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting a lot of company operations.
It's the first of five planned Trump's statements for the next week, including calls at friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the vote is approved on the election to complete the election of the Supreme Court, the Tempp will try to strengthen the support of those who have a temporary election, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress if the votes are added to the list.
When does the trumpet sound begin tonight at West Virginia and how do you look at it on the Internet?
The Trampa speech in Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 o'clock in the evening. ET tonight, on Saturday, 29 January 2018.
You can look at the trauma in the West Bank on the Internet below in the exact effigy on YouTube.
The tramp, rather than everything, will consider hearings on this week at the Supreme Court of Brete Kavano, which has problems with the chances of prosecutions in sexual harassment with pending confirmation in Senate of voting for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these statements is to provide help to the republicans who stand before the elections.
Thus, President Trupa's company announced that these five statements in the next week were directed to "activise the activities of volunteers and volunteers, as the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"The king of Congress is so important for his order of the day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states, as we enter the busy season of the anti-dumping company," said Reuters company representative of the Trump company.
The current action planned at the Wesbanco Arena Arena, in Wiling, can attract citizens from Agao and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports The West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The tramp is trying to help the candidate in the Senate of the West Bank of the Moriscos, who is the leader of the elections.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris, that the president must come to try to give him a beating," said Simon Hedar, a politician from the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Reuters 2018: U.S. Command is in charge of fighting to save lives on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions of Thursday's Thursday, perhaps, were meant to be necessary for this Rayder Cube.
The player of the impulse, what's going on, is a totally conscious sport concept in which the game really believes, and nothing more than the likes of it.
So where would they say the impulse now?
"It was the first with six points, and now the fourth, so I think we're going through it with a small impulse," said Jordan Spie, saving for the day.
It's going to take Europe, of course, on four points ahead, and in the game it's still twelve.
The Americans, as Spitch says, feel that in their light the wind has lifted, and they have what they expect, not in the last step, from the form of Spita and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each can be commended for the three points with four.
Spout was mortal from football to green and is an example.
These garnished cries of sanctification became more loud as his round extended, and he got a decisive hit to play in the mat on four fields when they met with Thomas two on two.
His attack, which allowed him to win at the age of 15, was met with a call like that, like what he tells you he thinks the American command is not off.
"You just need to go deep and worry about your own match," said Spity.
Each of these players has already gone.
18 removed to make a comment.
In the last two days, the only players who got more points than Spit and Thomas are French Malinary and Tommy Flytwood, the story of Cuba Ryder.
Strange, but wonderful couples in Europe four out of four can do nothing bad.
"Malwood" was the only couple who didn't make gods on Saturday, on the second half of the day, but they also avoided gods on the Saturday morning, on the fifth and on the second half of the day on the Friday.
It's happening, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd and from it, and it confirms that they're players that win Sunday, and there wouldn't be any more popular player to close the patent victory in Europe when the sun goes to Le Golf National than Flytwood or Malinary.
Both of them are expected to be at the same time on different departures.
The debate on European fame remains a thing of the past.
Bob Watson and Web Simpson did a short job over Sergei Garcia, a hero of the former Forschet when he was in a couple with Alex Norman.
Gods and two couple on the former nines shot the Spanish and the Swedish, with which they were unable to escape.
On Sunday, at least no one can help you with your lunch.
According to the mats of four cats and four girls, it's so interesting to watch over the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't make, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has become the best stone and has played a significant role in the last day, but at this fourth session it has also been shown that the US command seeks to fight, in which some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe comes to the end of the Rader Cube with number 10-6
Europe has a good priority on the last day of Cuba Rider after it comes out of Saturday's matches of four swords and four of the top 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired Duty of Tommy Flytwood and French Malinary appointed a battle with two victories over Tiger Woods to bring results in Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bourne, trying to save the tragedies that they had played in Hazelton two years ago, said to the American agency of discontent in the morning, getting a series of 3-1.
Already offered more opposition to the game of four cats, winning two matches, but they couldn't do much.
To keep the trophies, Uncle Jim Fury needs eight points out of 12 single mats a week.
Flytwood is the first European beginner to win four points of interest, and he and Malinary, who received the name Molliwood after the sensory exits, is only the second pair that won four points for his first four matches in the history of Cuba Ryder.
Breaking Woods and Patrick Ride into four swords, they were wonderfully pressed to move the united Woods and American Brisan Decomba yet 5 and 4.
The Woods, who drove himself through two mats on Saturday, showed a random flash of lightning, but now he played 19 of 29 times in the mats of four cats and four girls and seven beers.
Justin Rouss, restated on the x-axis of the four bears, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the four-footed game until the 2 & 1 Dastin Johnson and Brooks Koepki's rank is the same place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was pleasant, fresh day to the south from the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-year-old George Spitt and Justin Thomas set a control point for the Americans by two points.
They made a victory 2 and 1 over John Ramam and Ian Pulter from Spain in the battle of four swords and returned later to move Puler and Rory Michaelro 4 and 3 into fours, killing two of them.
Only two in the history of Cuba's radar command returned from the deficit of four points that go into one, although, in the direction of the Fury's commanders, it should only be painted to preserve the trophies.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the contract in the week seems to be that if they have everything.
North Korea says 'No way' will be split in a single order without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday the United Nations organization continues to impose sanctions that strengthen the U.S. lack of confidence, and in such circumstances the country cannot refuse from nuclear weapons in a separate order.
Ri Yun Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that in the past year, North Korea has taken "a significant measure of good will", for example, to stop testing in nuclear and rocket areas, to demand nuclear testing and promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the correct answer from the United States," he said.
"There will be no confidence in our national security without confidence in the United States, and in such circumstances there will be no way of first resorting to the same order."
Despite the fact that Ri was republikatizing ordinary North Korean charges against Washington's opposition to the "step" approach to duccalization, within which North Korea was rewarded, because it took progressive steps, his statement showed significant in that he did not reject a single announcement of declaration that had been made to Phinyan in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Xin and Donald Tramp on the first in the history of the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim wanted to work on the road to the "Denocleation of the Korean Revolution", he promised to provide security assurance to North Korea.
North Korea is trying to finish the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years of age, but the United States said that Phineyan must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington was also opposed to the call to abolish severe international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
"The United States of America is beginning to hold on to denuclearization and to increase the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its objectives in a forced manner, and even to say against "war end notification," says Ri.
"The understanding that sanctions can put us on the knees--the inevitable sea of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the passing of the sanctions deepens our lack of confidence."
Ri didn't mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trampa, which the U.S. leader had noted earlier this week in the United Nations Organization.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Mun Jay in the last five months and added: "If South Korea's participation in the issue were not the United States, it would not be that stupid."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed from last year's, when he spoke to the AAN General Assembly, saying that the landing on the continent of the United States with the help of the North Korean rocket was inevitable after Mr. President Zla's Trap called Kim "the rockets".
In this year at AAN Trip, which in the past year threatened to "complete the destruction" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take action on the election, but said that she would have to do much more, and the sanctions must remain in force until the North Korea denounces.
In the Wednesday Trip said that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, that's not worth it."
China and Russia are working in the AAN. Security Council said that they should pay Phanyan for the measures taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State. Mike Pampie told the AAN Security Council in Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue actively and legally until we are certain of complete, final and verifiable decolonization."
The Security Council reinforced the sanctions against North Korea in 2006, trying to stop financing nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Phoenix.
Pampa met with Ri in Security Council calories. The General Assembly then said that in the coming month he would call again to prepare for the next summit.
The Pope had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not successful.
In July he left Phinyan, saying that progress achieved from North Korea over a few hours of a break ended the declaration that he predicted the demand for "like the gangsters."
At a meeting with Monam this month, North Korea promised to liquidate a rocket installation and a nuclear complex if the United States would take "adequate measures".
The trauma said that Kima's "relevant measures", which he's waiting for, is a guarantee of security and a commitment to normalization of relations with Washington, which the Trip promised in Singapore.
The Harvard students are going through the course of the right rest.
A new degree at Harvard University this year must teach students more sleep, and my goal is to learn from culture rather than coffee in hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to look after themselves and their abilities properly.
Charles Chesler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist of blizzards named Brigama and a female hospital, developed a course that, in his opinion, is the first in his class in the United States.
Enthralled by a statement about the effect of a sleepless sleep on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lesson, a girl came to me and said, "Why did they just tell me this right now, at the last lesson?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep--it surprised me," he said The Telegraph.
First of all, this year's course, presented by students, explains why good dreams stop academic and sports, and improve general settings.
Paul Barreyra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and performing a PhD at the University of Applied Science, said that the university had decided to introduce a course after discovering that students often had to sleep for a week.
The duration of an hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a room on the Internet where students focus on coffee, French and books that tell about the influence of coffee and light and how a sleepless sleep works on sports shows, as well as on the importance of sleep before sleep.
At the same time, participants explain how many years of sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the compass, with interactive images, invites participants to think about their everyday life.
"We know it doesn't change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we think they need to know this as well as everyone knows about the consequences of breast-feeding," added Professor Chesler.
As for his words, the culture of the early evenings still exists, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students will lead to a loss of sleep, which is becoming more and more problems.
"A safe enough sleep must be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, discouragement and anxiety," he said, even to avoid lower weight, as the release of sleep makes the brain look smooth."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired to warn everyone on the platform.
He hopes that the next step will require all viewers to complete a similar program of education before going to university.
Professor Chesler recommended that students set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to go to bed, knowing the harmful consequences of the "black light" that come from the screen of monitors and light bulbs that can change the material mode that leads to sleep problems.
"Lovingstan" 1:0 "Ringers": My husband is killing Gerard.
The Rangers endured one more time when Dolly Mangy's head assured that Steven Gerard didn't get a 1:0 in the "Lovingstan" stadium.
Ibrahim wants to record his first triumph on the way to a triumph with a number 4.1 in the cold in St. John's, but the Order of Gerry Holttan is already taking the second time as manager of Gerard of 18 games to leave his side eight points, leaving the leaders of the Ladbrokes Hearts.
He hit me in seven minutes to stop, and the Rangers command, the inspired voice, didn't look if he had to wait a while.
At the same time as the Rangers descends into the sixth place, the Liechtenstein has joined the third place, and the Hibernates are left with the difference in the balls.
For Rangers there may be additional problems after how Forvard Kalum Spence should be afraid of the trauma of his head after he had an object thrown out of the tribune.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, so Ira didn't play in the Cuban Betford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went from the same Levy under 11 numbers, which allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was in love with how well they had visited their opponents every step.
The Rangers were more of a bear than a bear, but Liechtenstein had made more attempts to kill a bear.
They should have been killed already in two minutes, when Mangy first led the sword through Scott Pitman to the turn of Alan McGregar, and then the champion used this chance.
A successful strike by Jacobs Kegan succeeded in defeating Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgo was able to bring a strong strike back.
The Rangers got control, but in the last time the game was more likely to kill than they had demonstrated a good game.
Alfreda Marelas, of course, should have been punished with a fine for a quarter of an hour to the end when he and Steven Lowelles met in the field, but Judge Steven Thomas didn't take the treasure of Colombia.
The Rangers could only hit on the shoulder in the first half of the game, but it was the nephew of Abrox Liam Kelly who had barely shot the head of Lasan Kulibali and the effective attack of this Ehiary.
Although killing the first head at the 34th minute of Levy may have been against the next active game, no one denies that they have to predetermine with a good game.
The Rangers couldn't try again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Galler gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Mengo to get a chance to kill in the bridge.
Gerard replaced Kulibali's stop at Ryan Kent, and this was an effective act when attacking Marelius, but the terrible Kelly escaped and blocked the attack.
But "Lovingstan" continued to satisfy visitors, playing in the game that meant it and liked it, and lithos and Halket continued to share the sword after a long conflict.
The Bok Holt could only move in the last few minutes, but McGregor played well to confront Jacobs before the Ligs were sent to the stock market.
The replacement of Ranger Glenn Middleton occurred in a row once after the strike, when he met Jacobs, but Thomas got caught in.
Almanas: The source of the number of Geigers.
The page from our album "Saturday morning": 30 January 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIKI... the day of the future physics of Iagan Wilgelma "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of finding and measuring the radioactivity that led to the appearance of the device, of course, as the number of Geigers.
Geiger's doctor became a part of the science and appeared in the pop culture, as in the 1950 film called "Cranadas", where those seemed to be a little-known students of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger computer that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you're in charge, you really have the ability to hear the sound of the atoms that give pleasure to the minerals."
Evans, "Tell me, is this really bothering me now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, all for a few days to 63 years from the day he was born.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to use.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new antiquated vaccine can help the immune system to see and destroy bad cells.
The vaccine to teach the immune system to detect bad cells, which will be part of the cure.
The method predisposses the immune cells from the patient and changes them to the laboratory.
Then cells can see white, distributed in many cancer cells, and then re-enter helpful cells.
The test vaccine displays successful results for patients with different cancers.
A woman who was introduced to the vaccine, which helps the immune system detect cancer cells, saw that the cancer of rabbits disappears for 18 months.
This method allows you to see the HER2 white cells commonly used for many cancer cells, and then to be re-inserted.
That's what Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in the United States of Maryland said, and our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
" HER2 stimulates the growth of a number of anti-arranged cells, which are made up of small shells, eggs, easy and dry bones," said Professor Berazofsky.
A similar approach is to detect lymph nodes in patients and to “learn ” them to achieve cancer cells that work well during treatment.
The end of West entered the discussion in support of Trip, carrying the MAG, after he appeared in the SNL.
That didn't happen well.
In a study during the evening evening evening, Kane West was dismissed after the U.S. president Donald Trump said it would be a second time in 2020.
After the evening of his third song under the name "Gold-Privide," when he was in the "America Work Again Big," he spoke against democracies and confirmed his support for the Trip.
"How many times do I talk to white people, and they say, "How can you support the Trip, he's growing up?"
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would leave America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began a show with the main role of Matt Damon, where the main star appeared before the Senate's court committee at the time of considering the issue of the sexual abuse of Christine Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the expression was not transpired, the words of Westa burned in the frame and were loaded into social media by the comics of the Christmas Year.
I don't know if he tried to get Rock out of West.
In addition, West complained to the public that it had a hard time behind the culinary.
They trusted me with their bullets.
They said, "Don't go out there with this bitch.
They were thankful to me.
"And then they say I'm in a dead spot," he said, as the Washington Examiner reports.
The West continued: "Do you want to see a dirty place? "Say that he" will trust my little Sphere, which means he can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements at least two times, the SNAs took over the message from Veraiti. "All the studies were closed."
West was adopted as a substitute songr for Ariana Grande, whose boy, Reper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West surprised many of the performers I Love It, dressed in the water bottle Perrier.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Party, Kendez Turner, who wrote in a tweet: "One of the most careful spirits Thank you for your support."
But the co-director Karen Hunter wrote that West just who it is, and it's always wonderful.
"But I decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or his address, or by supporting his "mastic," which I think is a gross and misleading ideology that is damaging to my subpoena.
He's free.
And so do we."
Before the show the reper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he's "officially called Kenya West."
He was not the first master who changed his name, and went after the Jedi, also known as the Puff Jedi.
His fellow Reper Snoop Dogg called the Snoop Lions and, of course, the legend of the music that changed his name to the symbol, and then still he and the artist, previously known as the prince.
Trying to kill Belfast
A 45-year-old man accused him of attempted murder after he had been detained on the east side of Belfast on the second man attacked on Friday.
An incident occurred in Baliahcomor, as reported by the police.
It is expected that the accused will appear on Monday in the Belfast court.
The charges will be considered by the State Prosecutor.
Kita Horghton's game star has invented an idealistic brutality.
Kit Horgton knows his funny game and John Snow's role in the "Golden Islands" series in the bay of the middle-aged HBO
But a 31-year-old actor got a hero's stereotype, which means that young boys often feel more serious about respect.
Speaking in the Culture Department of Sunday Times, Kit said that they thought that something was happening and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his neighbor on the Golden Throne, Rose Leslie, who was also 31 years old, admitted that she felt strong enough to solve this problem.
"I feel personally strong guys when we're wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up from the point of view of the situation we see now?"
Kit thinks that television has to answer for showing generosity because of very men's personalities.
He continued, "What lies at first, and why learn about it?
Why learn on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they should be so confident to be a real person?
I think it's really one of the biggest issues in our time -- how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that things are going on with young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that the next summer the series ended, and he will come out of the field of battle series and will not do any dociles or lead to the "Treaty Thrones" game.
From November Kit begins to address true Western Sam Shepard, who is a historic director with his brother, who is a worker.
Recently, the actor told me to count the meeting with Mrs. Rose's best chance to finish the "Golden of the Thrones".
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The race played the Ygritch (Ygrette), a character in which the beloved hero Kitt John Snow played in this fantasy series, "Emi".
The couple committed themselves in June 2018 at Lesley's seat in Chatland.
HIV / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to the report, more than 820,000 people were injured in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were passed through sex as it was in the past.
Traditional HIV infection is spread in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
"But the number of people who have been infected with HIV through blood transfusions has declined almost to zero," Chinese co-heroes said at a conference in June.
Yet, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is a major problem for China's LGBT sub-group.
Homosexualism was decrimineized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to the LGBT people's right to eat.
Because of conservation costs in the country, about 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men end up having sex with women.
Many illnesses are spread out of insufficient knowledge and sexual contractions.
Since 2003, Chad has enjoyed universal access to HIV medicines in the context of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the evils of the accused, the uncertainty and the theory of the sentence by her fellow Members
From Congressman Maxin Waters withdrew on Saturday charges that her colleague placed personal information on three U.S. senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that the presentations are for participants of the right wing and their sites.
"A deaf, a dumb, and a lot of filthy nonsense," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
Public information, as reported, includes home addresses and telephone numbers in the United States. Sans. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Oryn Hetch, both from Yutt.
The information placed by an unknown person on the Capital Park while listening to the senate commission on sexual charges in relation to a member of the Supreme Court of Breta Cavano appeared on the Internet in Thursday.
The escape took place some time after the three senators asked Cavano.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and distributed information to the Waters team's contractor," reports Hill.
"It's unreasonably false and absolutely stupid," said Waters.
"The member of my command, whose data, personal information and security have been compiled as a result of these search and false accusations, and he has never responded to this information.
It's unreasonably false and absolutely stupid."
The Utter's statement quickly called for criticism on the Internet, in that case by the former Presbyterian White House Ari Fleisher.
"This rejection provokes anger," wrote Fleisher.
It's a witness that she has no courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone accuses of what they have not done, they must not fight.
They don't have to wear themselves casually.
They should not be suspicious of their mathematical accusation.
They must be peaceful and pleasant.
The Flexor compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of democracies to the Kavan court, when they accused them of being too disappointed at the hearings in Thursday.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who talks and participates in interlocutory elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"It's a resonance when it comes to reality," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had challenged the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false claims.
"We guarantee that the whales will be found," she continued, "and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions, which are designed and safe for any of the employees of my command."
Look at Johnny English Strings Again puts a bullet in the mind of Rouen Atkinsan.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new British film, and it seems to be in comedy and ex-French Johnny England, which began in 2003 from Johnny England and extended in 2011 under the name of Johnny English.
Can the clock be a good expression of how obvious it is when we talk about new export possibilities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in the press, uncompetuous Johnny English got the chance to remember things -- his name was more famous than all the comical creatures that he did to non-English filmmakers.
Of course he's a secret agent who, despite his clever presentation on the glorrow, got a bit like Clozo with Mr. Bin's rice and a bit of a guy who introduced a single note to Hor Hell at the Olympic opening ceremony in London in 2012.
His original character was originally based on the Windows and the international secrets of Atkinsan, which sometimes played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are several pleasant moments that have not been before.
I loved Johnny England, who was close to the vertant, dressed in medieval success, and a little bit of the rotary tossed around his back.
In Atkinsan for a theatrical comedy, light is displayed, but humour is weak, and so it's strange that serious films, such as Agent 007: Mission unusual, offer the comedy as the main part.
Humour feels as if it's not just for adults, but for children, and even the stupid unfortunate cases of Johnny England aren't as impressive as the silent film Atkinsan in private Bin.
The many years of current thinking are the serious problems of Great Britain.
The cyber hacker in the super-secret community of British spies in Great Britain, opening up the names of all British agents on the ground, until the disarming of a journalist is, unfortunately, a minor role of Kevin Eldana.
It's the last step for Prime Minister, who is a glamorous and mixed act that is already out of politics's popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this quasi-Tersey-Ma, but there's nothing like this in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that, since every real spy will be discovered, she will come to hire some of those who are already in retirement.
And that means that for Johnny England, it's all going to be complicated: now he's working as a sixth-star in a number of scissors and gives lessons as to being unopened operators: some good examples here, because England offers the Academy of Music lessons of Spanish.
England returned to Whitehol for an extra Briffin and met with her former friend Bo, who again played Ben Miller.
At present, because my marriage is connected to the command of the underwater boat, the role that Vicki Pepperdin played a little bit funny.
So Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they're working again, meeting a beautiful woman, Volgh Curileck.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic technical billionaire who states that it can solve problems with the Great Britain hackers: especially Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Boo start their horse with immediate things: masked under the office, burned the French restaurants; create a game, win with the counterbandists on the boat of the late Volts; English buys clean anarchy, because he's trying to use the virtues of virtual reality to find out about the interiors of the Volt's house.
All the moments are taken away for the last thing, but so pleasant and funny that there are quite a lot of kids on television.
Very good materials.
And how about other movies about Johnny English I couldn't think: can't the British cinema give Rowan Atkinsa the role that really demansulates his talent?
The Liberian party rejects the development of a four-day working week plan for payments to Brittany for five days.
The work party of Jeremy Corbin should consider a radical plan when British workers only work four days a week, but pay them five.
It is reported that the party wants the presidents to pass on the work that has been done as a result of the revolution of professional intelligence, giving them an additional day out.
It was seen that workers would get asylum from the three-day exits, but they would still get the same job.
The source notes that the idea corresponds to the economic program of the party and plans to guide the country to support the work.
A four-day shift was welcomed by the professors as a good way to use the change in the economy.
The oldest source in the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: "The plan of action will be completed by the end of the year.
This is not going to happen now, but four-day working week is an idea that matches the view of the party and the general business strategy for managing the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Liberian party is not the first to adopt such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend four-day working weeks during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the efforts of the Liberian party are not fully supported.
The representative of the Liberian Party said: The four-hour working week is a goal not a party policy, and it is not a party.
Chancellor John McDonald used a working conference last week to show his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he decided to return the power from the "illegal directories" and "managers" in the municipal domain.
The plans of a valuable consul also predict that the current water resource shareholders may not get back all the shares package, because the Liberian authorities can make a "high" on the basis of the planned interruptions.
He also confirmed that it is planned to introduce workers into the company's councils and to create a single fund of property to transfer 10 percent of their own funds to a private company that will hold decent individuals up to 500 pounds of starling.
Lindsey Graham, John Kendez distributed for "60 minutes", which after the FBI who works in Cavano, needs to change its measurement
The FBR's investigation of charges against the court of Bret Kavano dismissed the final vote on his election to the Supreme Court at least once a week. This raises the question of whether the Office of the Republican Senators can provide support.
In an interview with Efér on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the Republicans Jonny Kendez and Lindsey Graham about Sans: can the FBI find out everything that could lead to change?
Kendez showed himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, going to a court hearing: I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after what happened, and asked him about the reason for the accusation, asking, "Did you do this?"
He was determined and determined."
The complaint of Graham, however, seems final.
"I think Bret Kavano has decided that this will be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bret's just denying it," said Graham, referring to Christina Blaise Ford.
"And everything she calls, couldn't believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Festival of Citizens, and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the International Festival of Music, which has a very impressive composition of speakers and executives and my mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Culture Festival will be held at the large central park, where tens of thousands of people will come to get asylum from the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, and also learn about the real goal of mercy – the end of poverty and hunger by 2030.
The international festival of society, which was held in 2012, is the work of the Global Project against the heads of an international propaganda group, which is expected to stop poverty at the cost of increasing the number of people who are actively able to combat it.
To get a free ticket (if you don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors have been able to run a series of tasks or to "react action", be volunteers, write to the country's leader email, telephone any other actors, and raise awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful was the village festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goals?
Is it the idea to reward people with free concerts in a real way to convince them of the need for active action, or is it just another case called "climbism", that people feel they're doing the right thing by signing online petitions or sending tweets?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival have claimed that more than 19 million "actions" have been funded by their employers, who are trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage influential leaders to make a commitment to account more than $37 billion, which can affect life more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018 the group brought 390 comments on commitments and claimed at least 10 billion dollars already allocated or collected.
The assessment of the group, which has been secured by means of so far, has had a positive impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include providing food, partnerships with investors and actors based in Great Britain, "helping children to develop in full-time," a promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid the country's unemployment after more than 4700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national authorities and citizens of various countries, we can address social injustice in history," said Ambassador Tracy Luman of London in December 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions were conducted in Great Britain to improve food supply for the material and children, the media reported funding of the "Help for food" project, reaching 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the most common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end up with poverty?"
The global festival answered: This will be a long and hard way, sometimes we'll be patient right away.
But like the great civil rights and the movement against the apartheid, we're going to make a success, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickind, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Monae, is one of the series of people who talk about mercy in New York this year, which will be the theme of Deborah Jones and H.J.
U.S. can use the WMS for blockades to prevent the export of rice oil and gas
"The U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink, a Washington Examiner, has said that the U.S. Secretary of State can turn to the U.S. Navy when necessary to prevent the emissions of the Russian energy from the EU and the Middle East markets," said Washington Examiner.
The result of claims that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it acts at the request of the legal authority, is the basis for learning new energy markets.
"I believe that their reason for being in the Middle East is that they want to gain energy as well as in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the principal, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States is able by means of a military-marine fleet to ensure the openness of the maritime roads, and, if necessary, to organize a blockage so that their energy has not been found on the market," he said.
The Sinka turned to the meritors, organized by the Alliance of Energy Conservatives, a non-commercial group that positions itself as the "vote of Energy Conservatives" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, equal.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is less equivalent and replaceable," he said, calling Russia "a far-reaching country" with an economy that depends on the fishing fields.
These statements appeared at the time when the Trump administration tried to significantly increase its exports of natural gas in Europe, replacing Russia, which is much more subtle for European citizens.
For this reason, the Trampa administration, including the U.S. President Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to get out of the "illegal" project of the "Trump 2" base, which, according to Trampu, has transformed Berlin into a "full" mask.
The mask recently stressed that the North Pole 2 gas cost 11 billion dollars, which is created to undermine the existing gas power of 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin asserts that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is beginning to take place in the economy and is an example of unwarranted competition.
"I think we have the only view of that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that the sponsors must have the option of choosing suppliers," said the Minister of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak after a meeting with the U.S. Minister of Energy, Rika Perry, in fact in Moscow.
The Americans were hit in response to Germany, which reaffirmed their privilege of project.
A major German organization representing industry, the Federation of German thinkers (BDI) called on the United States not to engage in EU energy policy and bilateral relations between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German thinkers (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angeli Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her role in the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would seriously consider his part in the president's election after the interlocutory elections.
While speaking at the Mary Halioki, the state of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of his share.
"There was a time for women to run in Washington and arrange for our informal hall, and I'm also talking about women on the highest floors," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll be very serious about considering the possibility of being a president."
During the speech in Mary Warren turned to President Donald Tramp, saying that he "will lead the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm usually not concerned about what Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trip and his candidate at the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano.
On Friday, in his tweet, Warren wrote, "Of course, before the vote, the FBI should conduct an investigation."
However, the results of the applications published in Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think that it should be evaluated as a president in 2020.
According to a survey by the political research centre of the University of Safalka/Bostan Gloub, eight percent of Moscow's voters said that the senator should not be abdicated.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The question showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent were behind, and 48 percent opposed.
The other known names among the democracies that were involved in the patenting of 2020 include former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Agreed Associated Press Byden said that he officially decided to study.
On his way to Donald Trampa Sara Pallin's post-traumatic syndrome
The 26-year-old Turk Pallin spent the year in Iraq after calling for service in the truth.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with charges at home
"What is going on with my son after his return, I can compare the results of a devastating syndrome and injury that our soldiers return to other families," she said gathered on her way in support of Donald Trump in Talse, Oklahoma.
Palin called this "white question" and said that her son, along with other veterans of war, "turns back a bit of other burned-up, comes back with a question, whether there is this respect for which the soldiers, pilots, other soldiers, gave themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, the state of Alaska and told him the charges in the house against the woman, the opposition of trying to tell about the house, the possession of weapons in the state of the fifth, according to information from Dan Bennet, the police chief officer of Weasile.
18 states and surrounding Colombia support the suspension of a new policy on supplying port
Eighty-eight states and surrounding Colombia support the suspension of a new U.S. policy, which refuses to force an ambience on the side of a gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and surrounding Colombia gave an analytical record on Friday in Washington to support policy-making on port delivery, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the fact that Grace vs. Seans, which was opened in June by the American Union on civil rights against federal policy, was not revealed.
She said that her partner "and his friends from the hard band" raped her, but the U.S. authorities refused in port on 20 July.
She was trapped in Thaas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, with the largest number of requests for asylum in the United States, such as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American immigration policy changed the 2014 decision of the Appeals Commission on Immigration, which allowed immigrants without documents, which are victims of domestic violence, to return to the port.
The prosecutor-general of the province of Colombia, Carl Resin, said on Friday that the new policy " ignores ten years of threatening state, country and world questioning".
"Federal orders require that statements on the grounds be based on concrete facts and circumstances of the matter, and such a change violates this principle," the analytical note says.
The Yuris also noted that a policy that rejects immigrants increases the economy of the U.S., saying that often immigrants can be made their predecessors and "to create the necessary jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Seschens ordered judges in June on immigration matters to no longer give the immediate victims of domestic violence and violence on the side of the gang.
"It is also the case of those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to the social group or political views," Sessans said on June 11, notifying the policy.
It never meant the solution to the problem, even all the serious problems people face in the world every day.
The desperate rescue work in Paul. When he tried to find those who survived, he doubled the number of dead.
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," said 35-year-old mother Ríos Kusuma, comforting her little son with temperature at the evacuation center of the city of Paul.
"Every minute of the "fucking" car carries the ends.
The water is very small.’
The residents began to return to their divorced lady, collecting the dirty stuff, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, damaged by earthquakes, 7.5 bombs, were filled.
Some of the wounded, in that number two Harris, who broke the ring and the plate, are behind Paul's military hospital, where patients are treated on the street because of the strong stones that are coming back.
In his eyes the tears appeared when he awakened the feeling of strong dunes in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with the woman and the daughter.
"There was no time to fight.
I was stuck under the ruins of the walls," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to the city to marry.
"I heard how a woman cried for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to a woman and a daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of using a propaganda campaign
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-hour newspaper in the United States daily, expressing the mutual benefits of an American-China gang, an American passport in China accused Beijing of using an American press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump, in the past Wednesday, referred to China Daily's addendum in Des Moines Register - to the state newspaper Ajava - after China's prosecutors tried to make an election in the United States Congress on 6 November.
Indictment of the Trip, which China tried to interfere with the American election, noted that American officials called themselves a speaker from Reuters a new phase in Washington's press campaign in China.
The desire to place the advertising in the closed offices is normal practice for washing the flag, now Beijing and Washington have developed a handgun war, which has resulted in mutual taxation of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, said U.S. and Chinese experts, have been introduced to attack such exporters as the supporters of the state of Ajava, who support the Republican Trupa party.
Theres Brenstadt, a US ambassador to China and was governor of Ayov, the chief exporter of agricultural land in China, said Beijing had been found by American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in an authorial article of the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts by publishing a propaganda campaign in our free press."
"Consisting its propaganda, the Chinese are using a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing a disclaimer in Des Moines Register," wrote Brenstad.
"And when you look at the newspapers in Beijing, you will find not so many voices against and you will not see a real display of other measures that may have the Chinese against a dangerous traction in the economy, ignoring the fact that the press is under the sad fifth Communist party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused the offer," to print his article, he wanted it and did not mention it.
Republican women's exhumation of the previous temporary elections from the Cavano Fiscal, warning analysts
While many well-known republicans defend the candidate on the ground of the Supreme Court of Bret Kavan before the face of several sexual charges, analysts warned that they would be attacked in response, especially by women, during future inter-elections.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most of the Republicans already show that they're ready to vote.
"These things can't come back," said Grant Rihaar, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Siracius for an article that was printed on Saturday.
The director said that it was not sure that Senator Jeff Flyk (Arisona)'s statement of investigation by the FBI would be enough to silence the disbanded voters.
"Women don't want to forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow and in the evening," said Core Jan-Puer, head adviser and national press secretary of the progressive movementOn newspaper from Washington, near Colombia.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors scheduled the "Listad Fast!" during a demonstration in the Hall of Senat, when the Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to remove Cavano's candidate, despite the claim made by Christian Blaise Ford, according to Mic.
"Emotions and democracies will be extremely large," said the news site of St. Rothenberg, an independent political analysis.
"People say they're already high, and it's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among women-in-laws in the neighborhoods and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who want and don't like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before the opening statement of Ford, in which she specifically appealed to the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court for sexual violence, analysts believe that if the Republicans remain on the list, they may have a strong impact on the response.
"For the Republican Party it was something mixed," said Michael Stall, the head of the National Committee of the Republican Party's party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The story is not about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether it's happening in Kavan. It's about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they put it," noted the news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose democracies.
However, it's like the Americans were divided into issues of Ford's or Cavano's rights, so a little bit more than the last one.
A new question from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents probably or not trust the Ford statements, and 35 percent said that they probably do not believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent said that, according to their estimates, Cavano may or may have been hidden in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the strike by Flyk's FBI investigates charges against Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under an oath before the Senate's Legal Commission that, when he was drunk, Cavanaugh had tried her at the age of 17.
Ramirsh claims that a candidate at the Supreme Court demonstrated his generality at dinner when they were taught in Aile in 1980.
A global network vendor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
This Berners-Lei, the founder of the global network, starts a startup that is made by Facebook, Amazon and Google competitors.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Le solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and who has access to this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lie, he promised that, creating Inrupt, he meant "the world's domination".
"You have to do this now," he said about the start.
"This is the moment of the festival."
This program is using Solid technology to allow people to create their own data storage on the Internet.
This can include contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, photographs, and other private and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time on one browser.
The uniqueness of the personal data storage on the Internet, in that the user only determines who has access to the type of information.
The company calls it "the personal strengthening of the patent with the help of data."
According to John Bruce's executive directory, the idea of creating Inrupt gives companies the ability to connect with resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now composed of Berners-Lei, Bruce, security platforms that bought IBM, a number of developers working on the project on the contract and Valanciers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised software using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brenners-Lie said that he and his command had not spoken with "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not the full changes if all of their business models were temporarily reviewed.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a weekly publication on the question of Media Berners-Lei, the Inrupt mission "is a guarantee of commercial energy and ecosystem for protecting the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lie transformed the Internet by creating a World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lie have been very influential in the neutrality of the network.
Even at the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lei will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Fund and the Institute of Open Data.
"I'm very optimistic about the new ear of the network," said Berners-Lie.
Bernard Van: Stinging of a Priest, born by the Cross of Victoria in World War I
One Saint of the Church of England, born by the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a minister of fear, was appointed in his town over 100 years ago.
Major General Bernard Van was born on 29 January 1918 to be involved in the attacks under Bellengles and Leacour.
However, after four days he disappeared from the snowball and never found out that he had received the greatest war British reward.
On Saturday at Rashden, Nartgeptanshire's graph of his two grandsons on the board opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "very symbolic" that the stone was opened just over 100 years after his grandfather was born.
According to London Gazette, on July 29, 1918, Colonel Van brought his battalion through the San-Kentin Channel "through a thick fog and under a strong red and cool fire".
Then he ran away on the fire line and "with great courage" pulled the soldier forward, putting himself in the heat and striking three separate parts.
Colonel Van was killed by a German bomber 4 October 1918, and a little more than a month later, the war was over.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "nothing that I could never do as well as something worth respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also raised a candle after a parade that marked the Imperial Youth Architect of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "for his great honour to take part in the council," and added that "the power of a real hero was prededicated by the support that many show."
Fans of MMA waited all night to see Bellator 206, they got the Pope's candle instead.
Just imagine you've stayed all night to see the packaged transfer from Bellator 206, and then you're denied in the main event.
In San José's program there were 13 games, including six on the main map, and they were shown in the immediate ephemeral all night on the British Channel 5.
And in the sixth morning, when Gerar Moses and Rory McDonald ran to the docks, seeing in Great Britain they just fell asleep when the program was changing on Pepa's sand.
Some were disappointed after having spent the rest of the night, especially waiting for this battle.
One of the bloggers on Twitter called the conversion of a child to a child's milker as "some stupid joke."
In response to the question of the transmission of Dave Schwarz, the senior vice president of Bellator on marketing and communication issues, said: "Alike state position and 6 morning this content was inappropriate and should have been transferred to the child programme."
"Yes, "Swink Pepa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said they'll work on the program in the future to count British viewers.
"I think we measure the possibility of a repetition, however, we can solve this question," said Kocker.
"But now the sixth morning in the week, and we can't decide it until Sunday in our time, and it's Monday in their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Turn on, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and not all of them were attached.
We tried to solve the question, considering that it was a technical error.
But it was a state building.
I can promise you the next time you don't.
We're down the number of matches from six to five, as we do normally, this together we wanted to arrange fans, but they were scattered.
This is the end of the situation."
"Studies of the island": Tom Daley felt "mutual" because of sexual immorality
The almpic view of jumps in the water Tom Daily said that growth with a sense of worthlessness for others because of her sexuality – but this gave him a math on the way to success.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all like me," until he went to high school.
Speaking in Radio 4 in a leading Lauren Lavern, he said that he supports the rights of gays to give another hope.
He also said that when there was a child in him, he began to think less about the vices on the album.
The traditional guide of this rather old Kirsty Young program took rest for several months because of the disease.
In the role of a man who was on an isolated island, at Lavern's first program, Daily said that in childhood he felt “lower” than anyone else, because “the society didn’t accept those who liked boys and girls.”
He said, "I and now think that this feeling that you're not the same as all and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was a "man," he said that he did not disappoint those who knew about his sexuality.
The dual-wave show of the Aluminum was made by a significant LGBT movement activists and at the Games of the Association in Australia this year the country's call did not criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he said his reasoning, because he was able to live openly, without trace and wanted to give another 'hope'.
The three-year-old World Championship said that when he fell in love with a man, the American script, the director and the president of Dice Lance Blake, whom he met in 2013, "it was unexpected for me."
Daily married to Governor Oscar, who was 20 years older than him in the past year, but, as he said, the difference in age doesn't matter.
"If you go through this in such a young age," -- on the first album he had suffered at 14 years of age, and yet three years later his father died of cancer -- he said that it was hard to find a balance that would survive such a flood and disaster.
In June they were made by parents, their son was named Robert Ray Black-Dali, and Dale said that his "perspectively complete" was changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, in the world there are things more important than the Alpine medal.
Robbie is my golden Alpine medal."
His son also calls his father Robert. The father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said that the father didn't accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought whites at the London Olympics in 2012 -- he wanted to sit in the first show.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that the idea of it enriched my whole life--to jump into the water before my ballasts in the Olympic Games, that's the best feeling," he said.
It also influenced the choice of the song – Proud from Hitler Smol – which found a way to prepare for the Olympics and from which and now the mutants run.
"The islands of the island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 in British summer.
Michaelsan, who is not in the form, remains on the left-hand side of the Rayder's cube on Saturday
American Phil Michaelsan put a record on Sunday, playing his 47 matches in the radar cube, but he needs to get back the form so that this event didn't happen.
Michaelsan, who's gonna play in this assembly, which runs once in two years, record 12 times, Captain Jim Furrick's team is sitting on the boat on the Sabbath fork.
Instead of being at the center of the event, and he was there often under the command of the United States, a five-fold mover shared his days between the work of the corridor and the coaches, falling back into shape.
Even at the top of his career he wasn't the best player, and now 48-year-old golfer is not an ideal choice for an impeccable Le Golf National field, where the violence is causing immediate killings.
And if the field is not dark enough, Michaelson will be able to fight the exact British Open French Malinary champion, who, along with Tommy Fletwood, won all four matches this week.
If the Americans who stay on four points at the beginning of 12 single matches begin with success, Michaelson's match may seem extremely important.
Fury expressed confidence in this game, but nothing more could be said.
"He fully understood his current role, pushed me back, dressed and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furryk.
"He's very confident in himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Glory and gave a lot of orders in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it on two mats.
I was planning more, but I was working on the manoeuvre so and so we thought we'd play.
He wants to be in the field as well as everyone else."
Michaelsan killed Nike Falda's record for the number of matches in the radar cube played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in a radar cube, which was never the same as achievements in individual games.
In Mikkelsana 18 won, 20 won and seven played, the home of Fürich said that his presence had led to the use of the command.
"He's funny, ridiculous, with humour, he likes to cheer up people and just a very good person who has good command," he explained.
"I think that more young players with pleasure broke his jackets, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the command much more than a simple game."
The captain of the European Command, Thomas Bourne, knows that great distances can quickly disappear
Thomas Bourne, the captain of the European Command, knows from experience that a significant departure from the individual games of the last day on the grid can easily disappear.
The daisy player debounced in March 1997 in Valderam, where the European command under the leadership of Seva Balesteras had a priority in five points over the Americans, but it was finalized with a minimum of 141⁄2-131/2.
"You still remember that in Valderam we had a great advance and a move, but with difficulty, we had a great advance in Brooklyn where they had won," Bourne said after looking at how the Class of 2018 team won 5-3 and on Friday, and yesterday, and dropped with a number of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
"The story shows me and everyone else in command that it's not the end yet.
Tomorrow you have to play all over the table.
Get out of the field and do everything right.
Until the boys appear in the table, nothing's over.
We have a goal and it's an attempt to win this trophy, of course we're going to get married.
I'm constantly saying this, I'm born to 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware that there's the best players in the world."
Satisfied by how his players played in the hard field for the golf course, Bourne added: "I will never experiment with this.
Tomorrow there will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow there will be individual games, and this is quite different.
It's just great if you're in the field with the partners and everything goes well, but if you're playing one, there's your real golf course.
Here's what you need to give the players that they have to show themselves better tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, we have to go and also show everything better than an individual player."
Unlike Bourne, his opponent, Jim Furrick, is looking at the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they demonstrated in the party, except for Jordan Spita and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
The Furry himself was on both sides of these matches the last day, playing in a moving command in Brooklyn and playing when Europe had "The City of Media".
"I remember every word of this," he said, answering the question as Ben Kransho, the captain of the 1999 set up his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a quick start which you have seen in Brooklyn and in Medin.
When the speed grows, the biggest pressure is on those who play the ball in the middle.
We made the proper presentation and put the players in the way we liked it, and we'll try to get some magic tomorrow."
Thomas had the task of starting to act and speaking against Rory McKilroy in the main battle, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Jan Paulater will play against the football champions.
"I put my players in such order, because I think I'll close everything," said Bourne about my choice for individual matches.
A new German warship was remanded
The new WMF flag of Germany had to enter into force in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it did not appear in the next year because of the unjust system and the increasing cost, according to local media messages.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship's absolutely new class of Baden-Wuertmberg frigates, was released until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, quoting a military representative.
The vessel had to enter the stream in 2014, but the problems that arose after the construction were being overcome by this ambitious project.
Four warships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, still under command in 2007, must replace the old Bremen class frigate.
They'll be armed with powerful swords, different anti-competitive and synthetic rockets, as well as some steel technologies, such as reduced vision for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods between the service – more new frigates may not enter their party for two years.
However, the remaining determinants point out that modern baobabs - which can allow Germany to demoralize its power across the country - will meet up to the time when they finally enter the stream, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was hit by a headline last year when the German IMF officially refused to take the ship and returned his Blohm & Voss version to Hamburg.
The first Vienna-Marine fleet returned the ship to the wharf after the delivery.
The reason for the return was obviously little, but German media wrote about many "disabilitys in software assurance and equipment", making the ship dead in a bay mission.
The lack of software assurance was particularly important because the Baden-Wuertmberg class ships have only 120 matros, half of the old class frigates of Bremen.
It also appeared that the ship is very important, which reduces its productivity and restricts the possibility of further updates.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7000 tons, which doubles the weight of a class similar to that used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the lack of the value of the entire project, including training equipment, there is also a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – a home of 2.2 billion euros at first.
The problems associated with the new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the decline in German power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, head of the defense committee in the German parliament, said that the IMF "has less ships capable of military missions".
He said that the problem with time is increasing, because the old ships are registered, and the ships are not replaced.
He regretted that none of the classes of Baden-Wuertemberg were able to join the VMF.
The national anthems for the memory of the dead listened to the secret life of the dead
A new survey conducted in the Shatland mountains led to the discovery of how the Dutchman was used in fishing for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of single-flight birds and help in future actions to save these animals.
The study of the scholarly National Apocalyptics of the Shatland Islands is carried out by small ones and also by the long-standing Dabantons in Inver's gardens in West Roses.
Special recording tools will be located in the main places of this location to search for the words during the season.
The manufacturers and volunteers will conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all entries determines the frequency of calls being made, as well as what to do.
A live map and a report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, the National Nature Conservation Council, is expected to show what areas are most important for the speakers and how each of them uses them.
This information helps to determine the priority of creating such places of life as lakes, and how to support forests for the survival of species and other animals.
The number of speakers in Scotland and Great Britain has decreased significantly in recent years.
They threaten construction and development work that affects and destroys them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as a soft shower for the muscles and some chemicals for building materials.
Said not quite blind.
However, because of their nautical life, the ears spoke more sensitive than the eyes when the conversation was about fishing.
They're using a sophisticated navigation technique to figure out the holes and obstacles on the way to the flight.
National equipment, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important plants and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious to say.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, check places of life, and sometimes rescue munitions.
The organization even created the first and only Swedish commander said at the moment of Triw in Dumfris and Galway, where he lives eight of the ten times said by Shatlandi.
The current leader of David Thompson says it's an ideal theory for speakers.
"This, in Triw, we have just a great place to say," he said.
"We have an old building, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we still don't know much about the speakers, so our work here and elsewhere helps to understand more about their needs for a better life."
It underlines the importance of verification of the existence of the words before the possession of the property, so that it is impossible to destroy one sitting, killing up to 400 dogs and young people who say that it will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They are said to be under the yoke, and they are forbidden to kill, to frighten, to disturb, or to destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Feral, a worker of the Organization for the Acoustics of Scotland, calls on the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have much to learn about our stories, and many of the videos we don't even know how to live their populations."
Ralanda accuses charges of rape, and his rights are to be brought to court in German journals
Ranaldu's Clash called his accusation "fake news," saying that people want to "advertise themselves", using his name.
His rights are to be brought to court at the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which issued these charges.
Forvard of the assembly of Portugal and Juventus was accused of defeating the American Catherine Mayorg in the Los Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Then if he paid her $375,000 for a loan, he wrote on Friday, Der Spiegel.
The 33-year-old Instagram Live video referred to 142 million of its subscribers within hours of the release of accusations, calling it a "female news" message.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's message is a fake news," said the five-year-old Gold sword governor in front of the camera.
"They want to make a announcement on my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but this is part of my work.
I am a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
The Court's Court of Justice has condemned Der Spiegel's case to the question of accusations called "a negative message of suspects in private," reports Reuters.
Christian Sherc's lawyer said that the player will need compensation for "a moral damage in the sum that corresponds to the difficulty of breaking the law, and in recent years it may be the most serious loss of personal rights."
The incident took place in June 2009 in the port of Palms Howtel and Cassinos at Las Vegas.
When he met in the first club of Rando and Mayor, he would have returned to the football club where he would have raped her anally as recorded in the documents of the District Court of Clark in the state of Nevada.
The Major claims that after this Ranaldo called and said that at '99 percent' he's a good guy, who's from 'one percent'.
The documents confirm that Randa admitted that they had sex, but according to the side.
The Major also claims that she went to the police and made signs of injuries in the hospital, but then agreed on a case-by-case regulation, because "very afraid of replacements" and she didn't worry that she would "publicly bring it."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to renew her conviction because she feels a terrible sadness over that incident.
At the time, if Raaldu's case had been in place, he would have gone to the Madrid Royal with the United States Monastery, and this summer he would have gone to the Italian Juventus, closing the deal in 100 million euros.
Brexite: The Great Britain's "always Woes" lost the car repairers
The Great Britain "always misses," when losing its status as world leader after Brexiet, said the Minister of Business Greg Clarke.
He added that his "do not pack" claims the Toyota UK company for BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without any memory, the company is timed to cut the productivity at the workshop in Bernaston, shortly after Derby's half.
'We need a reminder,' said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact on the border of Brexie's absence of memory could lead to the cut-off of the workplace.
In Bernaston, where Toyota Auris and Avenues are held, nearly 150,000 cars were exported last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other EU countries.
"In my view, when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of the summer, productivity on our farm ceases," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Great Britain have raised the question of how a cross-border canal will be operated if Britain comes out of the EU without remembering. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it closes its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexie.
The main concern is that car owners are talking about the risk of a random set of devices that do not have any memory.
The Toyota production line is based on "dependency in time", when the spare parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers both in Great Britain and in the EU for cars being ordered.
When the 29-year-old Great Britain leaves the EU unremarkable, there can be obstacles that can lead to a halt and a failure of the shares.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to keep on the farm in Derby more than a day's spare parts, said the company, so productivity stopped.
Mr. Clark said that "Plan Chuckers" Tarshay Me about future relations with the EU "has been made exactly to avoid these border checks."
"We need a reminder. We want to get the best memory that will not only allow us to succeed today, but also allow us to use this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"The information we get not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we must be able to continue the work of successful chaining."
The Toyota company could not tell how long it will not work, but in the future it has stressed that the cost of reducing the competitiveness of the profession will be reduced and will lead to a job cutoff.
Peter Covaris, who works in Bernstone for 24 years and is a professor's co-ordinator, said that members of the university are very worried: "After my question, if the jobs are cut short, they're no longer renewed.
"We have proposed a precise plan for our future relations with the EU, which deserves trust."
The White House says that the Trip meeting with Rosinstein can be postponed again
A very important meeting of Donald Tramp with the assistant general prosecutor-in-Office of Roda Rosenstein could be "replaced yet another week," while fighting around the candidate in the Supreme Court of Breta Cavano, said on Sunday, the representative of the White House.
The developer is looking at the work of Special Adviser Robert Muler, who is learning the involvement in the elections from Russia, with the supporters of the Trapa from Russia and the patient opposition to the president's judgment.
Solve the trap of the general prosecutor's assistant or not, and thus put down the threat of Muler's independence, the months of oil falling into the fire of your tugton's arrows.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosinstein had taken the opportunity to take a hidden microphone to write a conversation with Trippa, and the possibility was to remove the president from the passport using 25 letters.
It's a development observatory.
But last Monday he went to the White house in the middle of a feeling about what is going to happen in the distance.
Instead, it was announced that on Thursday there would be a meeting with Trump, who was then in the AAN headquarters in New York.
The tramp said that he "did not want" to throw Rosenstein away, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid the meetings at the legal committee of the Senate, where Kavano and one of the women accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Chris Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trip ordered a week's investigation by the FBI against Cavano, which further encouraged the vote in the Senate.
Prime Minister Trampo Sara Sanders appeared in the weekly Fox News Sunday program.
When she was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date has not yet been set, perhaps at this week, maybe next, and I think that sooner, a week later, taking into account all the other things that have a place in the Supreme Court's case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the latest information."
Some journalists are ready to resist her harassment: Sanders didn't run a press briefing at the White House on 10th of July.
About the program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the shortness of the briefings was called not to be alarmed by the telepenets who "work on the audience," she wanted to add, "I'll agree with the fact that they're working on the audience."
Then she said that the indirect contact of Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is conducting more meetings with the answers to the press than any president who has been with him," she said, adding without any concrete facts, "we have learned these numbers."
The briefings are happening, said Sanders, but "if the press has an immediate chance to ask the president of the United States questions, it's much better than to do it through me.
We're trying to do this a lot, you've seen how we did it in the last few weeks.
The tram regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or the Barehouse meeting on the street, or in press conferences with high-performance guests.
The president's press conference is a rare one.
On this week in New York, the president presented why, when he was free and sometimes extravaganced before the restaurants.
Prime Minister of the state of the state of the EU of the State of the State of the State of the State of Scotland before Brexit
The Minister of State has written a letter to EU workers working in the Shatland State's Ombudsman System to express thanks for the country's name and to wish them to stay after Brexie.
John Freeman sent a letter less than a while before the Great Britain left the EU.
The Shatland are already ready to cover the cost of living with EU citizens working in the state services of the country.
In her letter, Mrs. Freen wrote: "Late has continued the negotiations between Great Britain and the EU on our country's departure, and they will come to the expected decisions of this province.
But the British Orad also made preparations for the script without any mention.
I know it's a very stressful time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and not only give expensive experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the slave trade, they also take advantage of our patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Abercromby's Cristian passed a terminal operation after the head beat
Linbeker Commander Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie has stopped the term operation after having received a break of head in a weekly mat, which his command has won 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The chief coach Tennessee State Rod Rod Ride told the reporter that the sad player had recently got to the end.
"He went on a side line and suddenly fell down," said Rud.
Coaches and doctors left Abercombi Kislarad still on the field before placing it on the force and moving to make a diagnosis.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was transferred to the Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there's no "expression of what it was like," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the player got the trauma.
Abercombi, a sports coach, runs the first season for Tennessee State after going from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full accounts that give all 18 bills per season.
Britian non-combatants will pay a bigger mail
According to the new plan, British conservative buyers will pay a higher order and extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralises the success of Corbin's initiative by attracting young voters
The increase in the government's postings applies to those who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Tersha's notice to me that the bound purchasers of the British estate will pay a higher government order, and the additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative by attracting young voters, as well as by making it available to people with high incomes.
An increase in government revenue is directed to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in Great Britain, and the funds received will go to the government programme for the year.
An increase in the current state dispatch, including a higher level, taken two years ago, on the purchase of other houses and the rent of rent, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 percent of London's innovations are bought by the unresidents of Great Britain, which leads to price increases and new buyers are making it hard to buy their first year.
Many rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become "citizens" because the large number of buyers outside the border spend most of their time not in Great Britain.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Baroness Johnson called to reduce the government's mission for young buyers to facilitate the first year's acquisition.
He accused the battle-building firm of holding high prices on the groundlessness and abuse of it, and called on my wife to cancel the quotas on the available river to make a 'fabricated stop with the ice' in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of railway reforms, including the control of interest rates and the halting of the "unsubstantial" visit.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in the area of the construction of the river.
My wife said to me, "Last year I said that my commitment to the Prime Minister's work to restore the British dream is a life for every new generation to do better.
This means improving our failed market year.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is unfair that individuals who do not live in Great Britain and limited companies can also buy unemployment easily as well as British workers.
For too many people, the sea has its own home to make it more ineffective, and the problem of homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage the Swedish Assembly"
Coach Sanderland, Jack Ross said his main ambition is never to be a trainer of the Swedish congregation.
The 42-year-old Schlandetz is doing the task of restoring the club from the north-east, which is now in the third place of the First Law, in three points from the first.
He went to this job in the summer, after returning San-Miren's to the Swedish Premier League in the past season.
"I wanted to speak after my country as a player.
But she didn't get it," said Rose in the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound transfer.
"I grew up, often hiding behind Shatland at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, this is the possibility that I will be a successful club trainer."
Among the presidents of Ross on the seat of the "Senderland" coach, Dick Advact, David Moose, Sam Aladdis, Martin O'Nil, Roy Keen, Gus Poye and Paula Di Canya.
There was a coach "Aloa Atletic" saying that he was not afraid of such familiar names in such a large club, previously rejecting the suggestions from "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"Now it'll be a success for me to answer the question, "Can I return this club to Premier League?"
Suitable structures and the material base of his club's place must be in Premier Lee," he said.
"Don't just get him back there, but I'll count my job successful only if I can get back the club there."
Rose only worked for three years as a trainer, so far he was a trainer in Dumberton, and for 15 months he worked at Harts train station.
Then he helped "Ola" to return from the third leg and turned "Sen-Miren" from the failure that almost happened in Chempeansp in the transition of the next season.
Ross says that it is now more handy than in his career at Clyde, Hartpol, Falkirk, Sen-Miren and Hamiltan Academical.
Looking at work in God, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training work is what I need, even more than the game.
It's amazing to hear because I worked well, did well and reached certain heights.
But the game can be tough.
There are many things you need to do every week.
And now I'm going through it when I talk about stress and pressure, but the training work is what I need.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm busy with this, and it's the best time for me for all my adult life."

Welcome to the perfect time to drink a song point - 17:30 a.m. Saturday
The summer of summer increased the arrival of British cities, which are struggling to survive, but it has brought pressure on the restaurant network.
According to the statistical group, the barges and bars marked sales growth by 2.7 per cent in July, but in the restaurants, sales decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Consultative Business Group, who collected this statistics, said: "The rising sun’s atmosphere and longer than expected, the participation of an English congregation at the end of the World Championship, means that in June, what happened, and in June, when the popes increased sales by 2.8 percent, and here the rest of them endured even more.
The decrease in sales in restaurants by 1.8 per cent in June, just got worse in the summer.
Pubs and bars, which are essentially selling drinks, until they showed the best results than restaurants.
Babies who sell more food are also busy in the sun, wanting and not as strong as they are.
Looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pigs and bars, the sale of alcohol increased by 6.6 per cent, and the sale of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analysis of rest and location issues, said, "These results are made by the trend we see at the end of a beauty.
The environment and the impact of important social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling goods on the public food market.
It's not surprising that the restaurant continues to win because sales fell to 4.8 percent a year, and it's very unpleasant if the cost continues to grow.
A long and hot summer has come at the most critical time for operators who are focused on food, and time shows whether the lower temperatures in June will take such an expected distance."
The overall growth of sales in the fields and restaurants, including recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the satisfaction of breaking down the barriers.
A tool for attracting sales in the British countryside, bars and restaurants of Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data on productivity from 47 working groups that have a total of 9 billion pounds, and is an important source of this gallon.
Every five children have a secret account in the pockets that it belongs to their parents
The survey showed that every five children - some have only 11 - whose secret accounts are in tapes that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of the Facial Insta page
It's just improved the fear of publishing sexual content there
Twenty percent of students said that they have "primary" accounts that show their parents
Each of the five children — some filled with only 11 — creates accounts in cells that keep them secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in Facebook Instagram accounts, which could be found on the Instagram photo exchange site.
This has also contributed to the fear that sexual content is published there.
Twenty percent of students said they're going to find "clean" accounts" to show their parents, and they're going to find private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found that she called on others to “save me.”
A study conducted by the UK Digital Awareness Company and the HMC found that 40 percent of the students from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very uncomfortable that so many refugees want to create places on the Internet where neither parents nor teachers will find them."
Elid Doyle will "voice of sport" in the Shatland Council of Easy Attractions
Elid Doyle was elected to the Shatland Council of Easy Attland as an observer of the council at an annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is the most well-run satellite and elder of Ien Bity described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to get a lot of benefits from her questioning at the most different levels, which is international in the last decade.
"Elid is using great respect in Scotland, Great Britain and the world sports subpoena, and we are confident that a light airport in Scotland will get a lot of benefits from her work in the council," said Beety.
Doyle said, "I want to act as the voice of sportsmen, and I hope that it will help lead sports in Chatland."

He wrote on Twitter: "That's why I was hit.
I couldn't go.

It was a hard job, but I completely adjusted, learned to walk again and now I'm practicing on an eagle!
Thank you for your message."
A small pump, where moms are compared to cows, shared online marketing
The small pumping company shared the marketing of a commercial that compares the cow to the cow that bears.
To mark the start of what is called “the first small pump in the world” Elvie's rival company has released an Iranian music release on the main video to show the freedom it gives to the mother.
The four real mothers dance in the dance with the cows under the song where there are such words: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have the pride" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not wisdom, it's my chest."
He said, "Yes, I have compassion on the child, I have compassion on the child, I have compassion on the child, I have compassion on the woman."
However, the advertising that was posted on the website of the Facebook company called for a warm discussion on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was insignificant, and many said it was a little bit of a fact.
"It is a very difficult decision to use arms for advertising this product.
Like us, they must observe and conceive to give milk, here's only their children choose within a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's small pump is undetectable in the fuel tanker (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It was understood as traumatic as it was for the mother and the child.
But why not use them for advertising a little pump for mothers who don't have children?"
Someone added, "That's such an unreasonable advertising."
The others protected the advertising, and one woman wrote that they counted the song "exquisite".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd like to have this if I'd be warm with breasts.
Disturbing the baby makes me feel guilty.
It's a little crazy advertising, but I like it.
It's a generic product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very funny advertising directed at a mother who decomposes milk pumps (sometimes at work or in the toilet) and hear themselves "crowds".
This advertising does not celebrate and does not justify small business."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with invisible little pumps hidden in their buffals.
The concept of a advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel their own way.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely useless, without any rights, neither dust nor mindful shelter in the kitchen for pregnant women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep the children and even leave the house while the equipment is working.
Ana Balyana, a partner and a creative director of Mother's company, observed: "Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a clear and correct start.
Taking the parallel between pregnant women and small cows, we wanted to focus on the decommissioning of the baby and its weight, while demonstrating the fun and convenient ways of making the new little pump take the extraordinary freedom of movement.
Elvie's little pump is no longer at the center of attention.
During the London Week, the mother of two children appeared on a handout from Martha Jacobowski using this product.
Hundreds of migraine-free children move to a target camp on the Teha border
Although the number of border crossings in the month has almost changed, the rate of growth has increased the number of migrant children detained, partly due to this being a heavy resort and a policy that is directed by the Trip administration, which observed the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who seek to endanger their own country by taking responsibility for their children.
The risks are significant in June when federal authorities announced that a patent sponsor and other full-time members of the household would have to give fingerprints and data to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranked immigration and ill-service worker, spoke before Congress on the construction of dozens of people who had returned from the request to suspend minors without a trial.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of the victims had no judges before.
"About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of their household are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them are criminals in the past.
That is why we continue to follow such people," said Mr. Albens.
For the faster processing of children, the principals introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, which, according to employers, was a standard period of 60 days.
A large number of people's statements about their own legal status to the immigration court will be used by video communications rather than by personally presenting themselves in the court.
Those who count have no basis for offering help are quickly dispossessed.
According to employers, the message from the source in the system, which appeared in the last month, is more likely to cause depression or increase anxiety, which may lead to the outbreak of violence or attempted suicide.
Lawyers say that in more war facilities, such as Tarniel, these problems are much more serious, as the signs of a child being in a safe condition, with the greater likelihood that they will be ignored by the size of the facility.
They add that the transition to a child’s target without spending time with emotional training or developing friends can cause anxiety, which many and so on have encountered.
Syria needs the immediate exit of the United States, France and Turkey
In turn to the AAN General Assembly, the Minister of Prisons, Valid al-Mullam, also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that continues in the country of eight years.
Muala, also a prime minister's founder, said that the restrictive forces are on the Syrian soil illegal, on the basis of the battle with the thorism, and "will be considered accordingly."
"They must go immediately and without any conditions," he said at the Assembly's sitting.
The mob insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people and millions of people had died in 2011, “only with terrorism was virtually finished.”
He said that Damascus intends to continue "saving this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territory" both from the terrorist groups and from "any illegal interlocutory presence".
In Syria there are about 2000 U.S. refugees, who are primarily involved in the role of instructors and advisers of the village of Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are in custody of President Assad.
The country's land contingent in this devastated country is more than 1,000 refugees.
On the question of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions for the return of the refugees were "some Western countries" in the "resurrection of Iranian fears", which hold refugees in custody.
"We call upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to restore their return," he says.
"They are only political humanitarian issues."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until there will be a political reminder of the end of the war between Assad and the opposition.
The AAN MPs report that the recent mention between Russia and Turkey of the establishment of a buffer zone in the last battle of the Idlibe has created the possibility for political transitions.
The Russian-Turkey Memorial was a large step forward by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the border where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the monument had "dependable terms", and expressed hope that war action would be directed against the dissidents, in that number of baviks associated with the Al-Qaida front of Nusra, which would "be destroyed".
Ambassador AAN Stefan de Mister wishes to call the first session of the new committee, in which representatives of the court and the opposition will enter to develop the post-constitution for Syria and make the way to the elections.
The lawyer stated that the work of the commission should be limited to "viewing the articles of the current constitution", and to the extent possible.
Why Trip goes to second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trup has succeeded in the 2020 elections, when many liberal viewers, impressions and scandals are expected not to finish his presidency.
And it will certainly be "the dramatic end of the presidency for all history."
At the moment, there is no sign of the presence of the viewer.
Since 2014, prime rates have grown more than twice – up to 1.05 million per CNN and nearly three times up to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the transmission of The Rachel Maddow Show, the MSNBC channel, gathered 3.5 million viewers and transmitted the billing cable TV in the evening when the main news was delivered.
"It's a fire to which people go, because we don't understand it," said Neil Beer, director of the ABC drama "Transmitter" about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the capital.
In Nellie Scowell, a series of scriptural comedians and authors of the book "For funny details and a number of serious proof of breaking up in the Hollywood Boys Club," there is another theory.
She mentions a trip to a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
- Why? - She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me happy," said Mrs. Scowell to me.
The chaos is still expensive and what can grow.
Of course, unlike all the rest of the television, the coherent lines that come out of Washington can be as definite a future as the case of the "Row Against Wyad" as it is, depending on whether the seven immigrants are united and united with the world economy.
Ignorance is a simple one that can only allow the most privileged viewers.
And yet, if you watch a six-hour team of experts attempting to use Bob Woodward's "not-to-print information" in the book "Strates", Paul Manafort's short $15,000 with a sharp skin (report, support of the Ganist, as wrote in The Washington Post), and the following brief descriptions of St. Daniels, um, Mr. Trampa's anatomism, this is going to be in the right course.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mary the same as before.
"The joy of what he does makes you feel like if you look at the reality of the hair that he displays every night," said Brent Mantgomere, performing director "Wellhouse Entertainment" and author "Pawn Stars" about the changing activist composition of the Trip show and the constant turning of the ring ("Spurg") from the NFL.
You can't allow yourself to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll leave the train.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleis this week, with the windows of his house on the northern coast of Kauai stood in a hot sun and 30 degrees warm, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC until he wrote CNN.
He couldn't stand it, not when Brett Kawana stood before the Senate's judicial committee, putting forward the future of the Supreme Court, which had passed on to the floor.
"I remember the ladies when we released these crazy shows, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleis.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

External cash flows are affected by a severe front-end of the mid-term elections in the House of Representatives
It is no wonder that the 17th chose zone of Pennsylvania has opened the silver floor thanks to the changes in the borders of the circles brought by Congress, from which two candidates participate in elections in one place.
A recent transition to a beautiful region of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conar Lamb, who won his place in the other circle on the sides of the past news.
Lembu is replacing another member, the Republican Kit Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th round of Pennsylvania, which is significantly in line with the new 17th.
The cards were transferred after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the study concluded that the voices of the old races were inconstitutionally calculated for the benefit of the Republicans.
A preliminary run in the new 17th round called for the financing of the company by the financial groups of the main parties, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Company (CCD) and the National Commission of the Republican Company (NCRC).
The Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a complex victory on the broad lines of the 18th round of Pennsylvania in love.
This place has been hired by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the round with a 20-point round.
Political experts form a small priority for democracies.
The U.S. government has improved the treatment of Salvador for China's support, and then they're gone.
The MPs noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing's position, despite a minor opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Panamanian Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and moved to the hotel in Panama until the partners left the Trump's command.
Representatives of the DPRK have decided to call US DPRK leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition", president of the U.S. President of the DPRK, Heather Newart, said early this month.
However, sanctions were considered only in the case of Salvador, which received about 140 million dollars of US assistance in 2017, in this regard in terms of drug abuse control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include the reduction of financial assistance and the target restrictions on visas, would be a blow to the countries of Central America with its high level of unemployment and death.
In order to complete the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America held a high-level conference dedicated to security and economic development, which would be followed by an analytical meeting in the past year, which was assessed as a step in efforts to promote immigration in the United States.
But to the middle of the story, senior representatives of the administration continued to understand what they wanted the conference to happen and actually stopped considering the question of Salvador's punishment.
According to the MP, Vice-President Mike Pensia is now speaking at a conference scheduled for the middle of the hearing, indicating that the administration is responsible for managing the merit.
And three American envoys without a forest returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new violent shipments or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three U.S. prosecutors, in which the two MPs agreed to discuss internal issues under the terms of anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by another, closely related to the administration of analytics, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step could be the case of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller about the possible violation of the judgment of Mr. Trampam, the examples of what is currently very difficult in the documents of the public character.
It is reported that Mr. Muler drew attention to the investigation of the possibility of the terms of the Trip and Russia company in an attack on the election.
When Congress changes the master, Mr. Trup falls before the face of responsibility before this body, just as he is enriched to speak again before the electors, and perhaps in the final result, before his colleagues' count.
There's a lot of 'if', and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just as he did in Europe.
We all, on both sides of Atlanta, have to make a choice that determines how long the battle will take.
In 1938 the German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, if only the West had shown him opposition and support for Chechnya in Munich.
We have endured a failure and have been able to avoid the following years of bloodshed.
History closes around the likes of the moment, and the impossible path of the democracies is either slowed down or slowed down.
Right now the Americans have met a few of these transitional moments.
What happens when Mr. Trump allows the prosecutor General Roda Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Muler's investigation sheets?
The divorce appeared in a difficult situation since then, as the newspaper wrote about what he had suggested in the past year to write secretly the words of the president and considered his impartiality.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the translation "The Times" was not valid.
"How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigates the case of Brett Cavan is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite the fact that it is worthy of accusation in sexual misconduct and unconstitutional evidence?
And first of all, will we vote in elections for Congress, which will move Mr. Trampa to take responsibility?
If we don't go through these tests, for democracies to follow a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to do it because of the lesson that I took to Prague.
My mother was a Czech Gabriel, who was deported to Asvenz by the same Nazi regime that sometimes bought my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and after 60 years she sent me to burn the Saturday candles on this table with her own.

Game Dorns with Rangers. Optimistically configured previous match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take the Rapid Vienna Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after a terrible thing in Spain over the Vlieral will allow them to leave the G League of Europe in the beginning of this month.
There's been a long round between the Graham Dorans' defense first to speak in the season to nothing 2-2 with Willial, but he thinks that Rangers can be used as a tramplin.
"It was a real match for us, because "Vilreal" is a strong opponent," a 31-year-old football player thinks.
"We started a game, thinking that we could get something, and made a point.
Maybe we could finally kill a sword, but in the end nothing has also been a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves into hand, and we had a better half field.
There's another important European football tonight in Thursday.
I hope we can make three points, but it'll be a complex game, as they showed good results in the last game, but, by counting the crowd of fans on the tribunes, I'm sure we can subtract them and show the good game.
The past year has been hard, both because of my traumas and changes in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The command is good, and the boys really get an asylum from the game; training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, move the result of the past season and move forward."
Women lose their dreams because of the fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the applicants had an accurate understanding of what they wanted to look at, a few of them spoke about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in the general survey found out that they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take steps to discuss it," said Holly Snaider, vice president of Nationwide for life.
Here's what you need to start.
Think of it with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not make your wishes.
Work with your consultant and family and decide where and how to get medical help, as this can be an important factor when determining costs.
Drag to discuss a financial consultant. It can also help you find ways to pay for these expenses.
Your selection of long-term care funding may include traditional long-term insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or you can save your life yourself, provided you have money.
Judge matters with legal documents: see the court's battalions.
Get confidence in your medical service to appoint a trusted person to control your medical care and to ensure that the specialists do the same if you cannot talk.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing a trust in financial management.
Set the person you trust to make financial decisions and make your account payments if you are not able to do so.
Remember the details: Imagine that your angry father needs immediate medical help, and he is on his way to the bathroom.
Can you answer the questions about banned drugs and the existence of allergies?
Check this if you want to be ready.
"They have a role not only in financial matters but also in the professionalism of doctors," says Martin.
"What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
You have to plan everything."
In Ilfracombe in a man several times shot with a pneumatic arrow
The man got a couple of fallouts from a pneumatic arrow when he went home at night.
For 40 years, he was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, the figure of Devon, when he was shot in the chest, his life, and his hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 at the local time, as a “dangerous incident”.
The patient didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening; the police ask witnesses to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the official figures, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that took place in the Indian city of Paul on Friday, and it is expected that the number of dead adults will grow.
Because of the exclusion of the fundamentals involved in humanitarian aid, they were unable to obtain any information from the Dongula Regent, a region in the whole of Paul, which is closer to the 7.5-ball earthquake epicenter.
In Paul’s home, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongala on the island of Solavesi:
Paul is the capital of Central Slovenia, located at the west coast of the island of Solavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake.
Dongula is a regenital, which extends over 180 miles (300 km) of the coastal line in the northwestern part of the island of Solavesi.
In 2017, 299,200 people were registered as administrative units.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic economy of Central Slovenia, especially the coastal region of Dongula.
There's nothing that's important for the settlement, but mostly concentrated in Morale, on the opposite border of the Soviet Union.
According to the Indian Agency's data on the outbreak of the tsunami, Paul and Dongula have repeatedly been hit by tsunamis over the last 100 years.
In 1938 more than 200 people died in Donganda from tsunamis, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Donghal in 1996, resulting in the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific firewall and its regularly scales the earthquakes.
Below are a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indian Ocean of Ača on the 26th of November of the tsunamis that took place in 14 countries, resulting in the loss of 226,000 people, more than half of them in Ača.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes were based on the western coast of Sumatra at the end of the spring of the beautiful beginning.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nice, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Magnitude 6.8 earthquakes occurred on the south side of Java, a lonely island of Indonesia, calling for tsunamis, which took place on the southern coast, resulting in the loss of about 700 people.

The oldest son of Sira Pelin is accused of being a domestic hero
Trek Pelin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice-president of the president of Sir Pillin, was charged with charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Pallin of Vasile, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted the information about domestic violence and the anti-arthic attack published on Saturday by the police in Alaska.
A police report was reported when one known man tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, and he added it to her phone.
According to the KTUU channel, Pelin is located in the next Isle of Matanuska-Susitna, at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he announced himself "very innocent," when he was asked, or he admitted the video, informing the network.
The palace is accused of three classes A violations, which threaten the release of free will for a year and a fine of $250,000.
He also claims to be guilty of the crimes committed in class B, which is governed by the release of free will on a day and a fine of $2000.
This is not the first case when a complaint against Pelin was filed.
In November 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pellin.
His mother, Saru Pelin, called the police to tell her about the planned attack.
The right now is in the eyes of the judge of the veterans of Alaska.
In the summer of 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, reports of domestic violence and armed robbery in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend insisted that he hit her face.
Sara Pelin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for their cruel behavior of her son with a post-traumatic syndrome called his service in Iraq.

The earthquake occurred shortly after the central Soviet Union, which is located in the north-east east of the station of India of Jackart.
Social networks have distributed videos that show the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Paula when the tsunami broke out at the shore.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death sentence for suspects in New York City
The federal prosecutor in New York is sentenced to a death penalty for Saiful Saipova, who was sentenced to a death penalty in New York, resulting in the death of eight people — a rare punishment that has not been used in a federal crime scene since 1953.
Saipas, 30 years old, used a pick-up call from the Home Depot company to travel on a highway along the West Side in Lower Manhattan, driving passengers and passengers on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, a warning of the intention of the death penalty given in South New York, prosecutors must prove that Cyprus has "sounded" eight people and "sounded" ships with serious total injuries.
In accordance with the material of the court, both cases could be punished as a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal prosecution of the Saipova filed a complaint from 22 points that included eight charges of murder in support of the bill; this is usually used by federal prosecutors in criminal proceedings, as well as a prosecution in the government and the destruction of transport.
According to the prosecutors, the attack called for "an ancient and wise planning", and describing the actions of the Japanese crimes, such words as "stupid, cruel and vengeful."
"Shipula Habibulaević Saipou caused trauma, damages and loss of family and friends, Diego Enrique Angelina, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Lory Dekadt, Darena Drake, Ariel Erna Feruch, Erna Diego Mendasa and Alejandro Damien Pagnuka," says the message.
Five of the missing were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last time the criminal case was settled, the death penalty in the Southern New York area has been over for ten years.
The representative of Halid Barnes was sentenced to the death of two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York on the federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenbergau, a married couple who had been sentenced to two years before being sentenced to a sentence of Spanish for the use of the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Para Rosenbergau was awarded an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
The Saipas, an outpost from Uzbekistan, in accordance with the court documents, had demonstrated the lack of consent in the day and month after the attack.
According to the police, he said the next thing that feels satisfaction from his engagement.
As for the charge of sedition, Cyprus informed the authorities that, in an attack on him, he had been inspired to watch a video from the Islamic state on the phone.
He also requested permission to bring the Islamic State's flag to the balnical palace, reported to the police.
He doesn't accept himself as guilty of a conviction that consists of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal civil defenders representing Cyprus, said that they were "unbelievably disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to make a death penalty, not a life-threatening defeat without the possibility of an escape, is only to prolong the worst of these events for all participants," said the Lord.
The defense command of Cyprus had previously asked the prosecutors not to make a death sentence.
A member of the Parliament of Tory says that Nigel Faraj should indicate talks about Brexit.
Today at a party conference of Tori Nigel Faraj's party, he called for "mabilizing a national army".
The leader of the Ukip said that politicians should "feel discofort" from the Eurosceptics – as one of the members of the Council of Tarshes offered me their candidate for EU transfers.
A member of parliament from the Conservative Party of Peter Bown said in March in Birmingham that Great Britain would already "come up," if Mr. Faraz had taken the seat of a secretary in Brexit.
But the problem faced by Mrs. May, trying to attract her distinguished volunteers, still got worse when Thores, who are trying to save EU membership, took a special stand against Brexie in the city.
The Premier of all forces is trying to keep a compact Czech memory under constant pressure from the owners and workers of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The allies continued to try to close the business with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force the Eurosceptics and the Liberians to choose between its packages and the "missing".
Mr. Bown said at the meeting in Salikale, "Let Means Leave" that he wanted to "drive Chucker out of the shower".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj do the same and make arrangements for talks with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would already go out," he said.
A member of parliament from Velingbar added: "I'm for Brexit, but we need to leave the Czech plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be dependent.
We want to implement our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bowen dismissed the fact that the civil opinion changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea of what the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely out of line with reality."
President Brexie and member of Tory, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in talks with journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Czech plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party and activists who actually go out the street and pick us up.
Please turn away from the plan and begin to listen."
She added, "The Prime Minister will remain on the ground when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should be forced to feel discofort, when they are going to make a good decision at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us - people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to say hello to Brexie, and we're here today to tell him, "It won't come with you."
In his response to the alarmed crowd he added: "I want you to force those of our politicians, who are ready to welcome Brexie, to feel disharmony.
"We are emblazoned with the national army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexice, and we will never be at peace until we become independent, self-imposed, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, the workers went through Birmingham before spending two hours in the city center.
A number of activists defeated the Tories Against Brexit banners after the group started in these exits.
The Liberian lord Adanis looked over the conservators with the opportunity of a security problem that they encountered because of the evening program at the opening of the conference.
"These people who tell us that they can have ready to use the IT system and all technology for Canada plus, for the border without a train, for a free gang without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete fascist.
Like the good Brexiet. There is no such thing," he added.
Warren plans to pay public attention to the president's balancing process
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after her election in November, she "really focused on the president's assessment process".
The Boston Globe reports that a democracy from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about its future during the general departure of the western Massachusetts.
Warren, part of president Donald Trump's criticism, is going to be re-elected, to be replaced by a member of the Republican party, Jeff Dil, who was the oldest Trupa company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a potential tramp shop in 2020.
It has been 36th meeting with electors since the start of the Tromp's trip, in the form of a general walk that went on Saturday in Halyak.
One of the participants asked whether she was planning to vote in the president's position.
Warren replied that the time had come for "the woman to go to Washington to repair the broken wound, and for this reason a woman should be on her head."
The battle took place after the death of basketballist Sims from the command of the University of Louisiana
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of the U.S. Secretary of State Wyad Sims was arrested on Friday.
The baton-Russia police leader said about the 20-year-old Dean Simpson's arrival during a press conference that went through 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting, asking for help to get to know the man who painted it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning at the South University campus.
"Wide Sims got a gunfight in his head as a result of his death," said the police chief, Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday, canal journalist "247sports".
Wade went after his friend and was shot by the Simpson.
In the interview, Simpsan admitted that he was in a crime scene, was armed and shot at Waeda Sims.
Simpson was not opposed to the war and was taken under guard in the police service of the East Baton-Rug area.
Sportsman-Union is growing 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) tall in Baton-Röj, Sims in the last season played 32 games, 10 of which were on board from the beginning, in the middle of the platform 17.4 minutes, leaving 5.6 points and 2.9 points for the game.
Gran Perry of Russia: Luis Hamelton was approaching the world champion after he received a victory over Sebastian Fatell.
From the moment Walter Botas turned on the qualifier of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the commands inside the Mercedes command play a significant role in the race.
The botass pulled out a good place on the slaves and almost left Hamilton on the edge of the forest until he defended his place on the first two religions and asked Fate to attack his friend by command.
The first meal went on foot and left Hamilton fighting at the end of the general crowd of runners, of course this manoeuvre should have been decisive.
The Mersedes pilot went on foot in the circle later and went out behind the Fetelle, but Hamilton went forward after several round-to-cow manoeuvres who forced Ferrari to leave the inner space freely, risking to remain behind a double manoeuvre to defend himself on the third floor.
Max Frostapen, on his 21st day of birth, started from the back series of networks and until the end of the first round was on the seventh floor.
Then he led most of the race until they kept their own, because he wanted to run quickly, hire Kim Rianna and take the fourth place.
As a result he went on foot on the 44th circle, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds, so Ryanen took a fourth place.
It was a hard day, because Walter had all the outward expressions fantastic and told himself to a real gentleman if I would be allowed to speak that way.
"When she did a great job to take the first and second place," Hamilton complained.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Tramp raised Senator Jean Fynstein in the middle on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the birth certificate of Christine Blaise Ford, in which she accused a candidate at the Supreme Court of Bret Kawan in sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in the West Virginia, the President did not direct his attention to the statements made by the Forum before the Senate's Court of Justice, instead of commenting on what happened in the Senate, showed how people can be "subordinate, fair and unjust".
"One thing that can happen, and it's beautiful that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, it's when you see anger when you see bad, dirty and stupid people," he said.
"When you read about pre-religion and tears, then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Do You Remember?
Diana Finchstein, is that your uncle?
Remember her answer... you lost the document-- "Oh, ho, what?
No, no.
There was nothing from me."
Wait a minute.
We let the daughter... no, we didn't," he added, recommending the senator.
Fainstein in Lebanon sent a letter with a detailed explanation of charges issued by the Ford against Cavan, and he ran off at the beginning of the spring -- but Finstein denied that the baby had happened from her office.
"I didn't blame Dr. Ford, I didn't let her story go," said Finstein of the committee, reporting "The Hill."
"She asked for the story to remain confidential and I granted her request."
But her denial probably didn't like the president who made it during the weekend: "What I'm telling you, it was really a bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by women, the president said that the democracies used accusations for their own purposes.
"They are full of determination to return power to themselves with any means.
You see the area, the measure, and they're all equal to what they're going to suffer, through which they're going to change to get power and control," says the President, "Mediaite".
Elite League: Andy Stars – Belfast Janets 5-3
Pttrech Duier killed two of the men after Janets in a fight against Dandy
Dandy Stars was attracted by the fifth confrontation that had led him to Belfast Janets in the Elite League, winning a reverse match with the number 5-3 in the domestic match on Saturday.
Thanks to the strike of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bawley Jaans, they were headed on two fronts.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie corrected the number before Doier renewed Jaiants' leadership.
The French Busher from Denmark had corrected the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nelson had secured the victory command by both sides.
It became the third parasite in the Elitna bed after the season for Adam Kif's command, which led Dandy to 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
Commands met in the fourth time after the season; in the previous three matches the Jaiants were defeated.
The first head in the fourth minute of the matzo (03:35) killed Duier from the Candala MacFola accident, and after four minutes Bavielle doubled the number after David Rutherford's accident.
In the opening of the first period (13:10) Sullivan opened the number from the master of the field, and then the Canon fixed the number after the transfer of Matt Markward (15:16).
The Duyer assured Jaiants of leadership when he went out on his first stop, killing his second boss at the end of the first period.
Taking the side, he regrouped, and Bush again corrected the account, killing the chief at the medical command (27:37).
Conun and Charles Carcoran helped Nelson get Danny out first for the match at the end of the second period, and he ensured victory along with the fifth command number in the middle of the last period.
Janets, who had already played four of the last five meetings, played the last game at home against Milton Keins on Friday.

Then he jumped out of the dyspepsy height when he decided that she was upset.
Later he died in the bathroom.
According to the Australian ABC News program, the Air Navigation Indonesia representative Johannes Sirita, a judge who may have saved hundreds of lives, said.

Are you ready?"
Earlier this year in India, it had endured earthquakes in Lamboca, where more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini sent a message to a person without news after the plane crash in a lake
The airline, which carried out a raid, which took place in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and command had successfully evacuated from the plane that had landed, and now it is reported to be disappearing without a passenger's notice.
Air Niugini reported in a press release that she could not report on the location of another passenger on Saturday.
The airline reported that she was working with local authorities, balsamists and others to find a man.
The airline did not immediately provide details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and command after the plane crash on the water while trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the officers reported that seven people had been hit in the bathroom.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the bathroom on Saturday; they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the breach, as well as the exact sequence of the events, remains undisclosed.
According to claims, both the U.S. airline and the U.S. U.S., the plane landed in the lake, not going to the ground floor.
Some of the Witnesses have also passed the post office by plane.
According to American passenger Bill Jensens, the plane was very low.
'That's very successful,' said Janes.
According to his words, he and the others were able to pass through the water to the emergency exits of a plane that had already been shut down.
He said that the shipowners panicked and started shouting, as well as that he had received a small stroke of his head.
The U.S. U.S. reported that the seams that had cut short the coast also helped rescue, using a boat that was designed to move people to the shore until the plane was about 100 feet [30 m] deep.
According to the Network of Aviation Safety, 111 people were killed in a crash recorded in Papua New Guinea in the last 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analytical repeats the night of the incident when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charges were finalized in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of Mississippi in 2014.
An analysis of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Roulette gave evidence for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He's been writing a record of how he used cell phones to find out the movements of 29-year-old Quintana Telis and 19-year-old Uncle Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As The Clarion Ledger reports, according to Roulette, he got information on the location from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was from Chambers at night her death to contradict his previous statement.
When the information that his mobile phone was near the Chambers phone at the time when, according to his assurance, he was with his friend Michael Sanfard was confirmed, the police were about to contact Singapore.
Senator gave a statement on Saturday and confirmed that on that day he was not in town.
If a party of accusation asked, or said Telis is true of what the synfard was in that morning, he said that he "listens, as my Furgon was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was the assertion of Telis that he knew from Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The phone records showed that they knew each other every week.
According to Roulette, some time after the death of Chambers Telis removed her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He stole her from his life," said Haley.
The side of the defense must start a discussion of the side in the week.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be handed over to the jury later that day.

Such performers as Akala and Lowkey, returned to the popularity of the Great Britain, such as The Fugees and Commons.
One more carrot?!
No one in New York's trial for a couple of days after the release of a "scream" message
No one in New York is courting a marriage partner for a disciplinary divorce after receiving an accidental e-mail from her mother with the thought that she was "one more carnage."
The couple deny that they're racist, just calling for "industriality".
In 2016, Linci Plasca-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed frustration at discovering that the new moon, Jijsel Morris, was a fan when she arrived on her first working day.
"No, no, no, no, no, no," wrote Mrs. Plasca-Flaxman in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent a message to Mrs. Morris.
As New York Post reports, with a misunderstanding, "failure" Plassa-Flaxman let Mrs. Morris, asserting that the former nun, who was also an American, was badly treated at work, and that she was waiting for her Philippines.
Mrs. Morris paid for the work day and sent it home to Uber.
Now Morris falls to a couple in court and wants to get compensation for breaking up in accordance with the conditions on which she was first hired, although without a contract: $350 a day for six months with a living.
"I want to show him what to do not do," she said "Post" on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied charges of racism, claiming that the denial of Morris was a wise decision, considering that they could not trust her after they had chosen her.
"My wife sent her what she should not have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said his husband, Joel Plasca.
"And would you trust your children to whom the grave is about, even if it were an accident?
I didn't mean it?
Isn't it?"
The platform addresses the call to "infancy" and reports that his wife was born two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"And will you be able to follow a man in such a state?
It's pretty hard," added investment-banking specialist.
While judicial understanding continues, public opinion quickly condemned a couple in social networks, putting their conduct and logic at risk.
The publishers of the Podganto said that readers would not oppose the transport that speaks of speaking in a new paper
The daughter of Bonda Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads her first before she'll be published.
So it's interesting to read, already knowing about the great success of Paddantan."
She explained that her father, who worked for BBC operators until she had noticed writing a book for the children about a small piece of paper, was optimistic despite the fact that his work had not been accepted and added that the 60-year release of the book was "bad-soldish" after his death last year.
She added that her father quietly won his final victory, referring to Paddantan, which she describes as "a very important member of our family."
"He was quite a quiet man, and not quite thankful," she said.
"But since Paddangan was so real to him, it was almost a father's honour for a child who had something to do: you respected him, although it was actually not your job.
I think he looked at the success of the undercover manoeuvre in such a key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he has always given due credit to the Lord himself."
My daughter died, and I came to talk to her on the phone
After the funeral her daughter was brought to Nica Louie Pastera's balconies 2, where the doctors had done well for her life.
"Then she regularly telephoned to say that everything was really bad that she didn't get," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then I phoned Nad to say she would die for the next two minutes, and I came to celebrate with her.
And I did it.
I said, "Well, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to heal her heart slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and it was the last time.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was breaking up there.
I couldn't stand, cry, or cry, because there were seven and people around me.
I should have kept it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who passed away the loss of the daughter, the village alone with other passengers -- and they didn't know what she was going through.
'No one knew,' she said.
"I cut my head and face all the time the tears.
It's hard to explain, but the manoeuvre in the field caught me feeling Nade's compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women who are upset with taking up cards to prevent their own deaths
Two women who lost their loved ones, who ended up killing themselves, do all they can to keep other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphris carry cards on warm words and telephone numbers that people can get help at the bridge in Wales.
The son of his wife, Davis Tyler, was 13, when he started depression, and at the age of 18, he ended his life with suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel as I feel myself," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Ledny, said her son was a talented boss with a disgusting smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would shine any room."
Before his death, however, he left his job because he was “in a very dark place”.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who at the time was 11, found his brother's body when he ended up killing himself.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still worried that this could be unacceptable."
Mrs. Davis created the cards, "to know that there are such individuals in the world that you can turn and talk even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Hasfries, who has spent many years with Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner, who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that," she said.
"For a few days till Christmas we noticed that his attitude changed.
On Sunday he was very excited: when the children opened gifts, he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but should have been with this life: "In the family there was a big hole.
It's just killing us.
But you have to keep living and win."

The future Breta Cavano is uncertain, because the FBI's starting investigation.
"I thought we could have what he wanted – limited in time and in a lot of research – we could get a bit of unity," said Mr. Flyk on Saturday, adding that he did not worry that the committee would "dissolve" because of what actually happened in the trial.
Why would Mr. Kavano and his republican citizens not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
They don't want to be understood at times.
The interlocutory choice of all over five weeks, 6 November -- if it is expected that the Republicans will be patient once, then they will be weakened in their efforts to choose the supreme court of the candidate they need.
George Bush called the senator to extend his support to Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife, Ashley, who then worked as personal secretary to Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 democracies are now sitting.
Until it became clear whether Mr. Cavano would like 50 votes during the Senate vote, which would allow Vice President Mike Pens to resolve the problem of equal votes and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased during Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea declined from the time when Kim Chen Yin came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean minister.
Again, Bo Sun, bringing the Ministry of South Korea's data on the organization, said there were 1127 refugees last year, and in 2011 2706.
Mr. Pock said that the main reasons are strengthened border controls between North Korea and China and the higher costs that have been put in place to repair.
Phenyan didn't comment on it.
Most refugees are fully aware of why they get South Korea's society.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korea residents illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
The majority runs through China, with the longest border in North Korea. It is easier to move than the DMZ between two Koreas, which is very powerful.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced to repatriate them.
The relationship between the Red and the South – which technically is still in the state of war – has improved significantly over the last month.
In the beginning of the month, the ligaments of the two countries met in Phenyana for the conversions that involved denuclearization.
This happened after a historic meeting of US President Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Xin in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work with the aim of getting rid of the Korean nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ray Jan Ho accused the American sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"There will be no confidence in our national security without confidence in the United States, and in such circumstances we will not be divided into the first," said Mr. Rey in a speech to the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelois called Breta Cavano's "stars," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Chamber of Nance Peloise called the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brete Cavan "stars" and said he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelozy said this in interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune's festival in Ostenna, Texas.
"I couldn't escape the thought that if a woman did so, she would be called "sterious," said Pellos about her reaction to the Cavano talk before the Senate's Legal Commission in Thursday.
There's a huge emotional cover of charges of sexual harassment against the Dr. Chris Blaise Ford, when they were still refugees.
During his opening speech Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and couldn't speak when his family and the oldest class of school were murdered.
He also explicitly accused democracies in the committee, calling charges against him "gratsy and organised suicides", organized by liberals, which were released because Hyker Clinton won the 2016 presidential election.
Pélos said that they thought that the statement of Cavano showed that he couldn't work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had the ability to oppose democracies.
"I think he himself disqualifyd himself with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pélois insisted that when she was asked whether she would try the oppression of Cavano, when he was elected and when the democrats get most in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so--if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he should not only work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pellos.
At this point, Kawano is the judge of the district appeal court of the province of Colombia.
Pélois added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was not troubled by the patentive decisions of Cavano against the law on available medicine or in the case of Roo against Wyad, because Cavano is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings of confirmation on the Kawano station, he did not answer the question whether he would break down certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now it's not time for the strategic, untargeted individuals to work in court and wait for us the words "like it's wonderful," said Pelos.
And a woman must know that.
It's a true accusation speech, months and years of anger just turns around, and she can't imagine it without a word.
"We cry when we're wrong," said Mrs. Steine to me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's such a shortness."
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who had a lot of work as a director, and who said that when she was in trouble, she cried, but she was working a mechanical drive. When she was in trouble and she started crying, she said to the constables: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm wrong."
And she just kept talking.
I think it was great."
The tears are partially allowed to come out of the sum, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my first work, on which I once cried out of unsatisfied wickedness, then I was caught by a woman in the corner, a strewn chief who always scared me a little -- and pulled me to the back.
"Never let them see you in tears," she said.
"They don't know you're fired.
They think that you are sad and will be happy that they have given you."
Patricia Schrodar, then Congressman Democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with George Hart in the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt fell on his marriage health on the ice under the name of Monkey Business and came out of the presidential run, very disappointed Mrs. Shrodar thought she could and herself participate in the presidential company.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she laughed to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I was completely unnecessary to them.
Someone called this "Seven Crimes."
As the company had gone a long time ago, she had no resources, so she said that she wouldn't take part in the elections unless it took $2 million.
That was a sad situation.
It turned out that some of her favorites, who owed men $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm going with the trigger?" she thought.
When she said that she would not participate in the electoral campaign, she was so deeply affected by the emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her, the evils on the system that so complexed the receipt of money and directed to the electors, not the candidates, and the anger on the sex -- that in her spirit was overcome.
'You might think that I have a nervous vision,' thought the Mrs. Cheroder's reaction to the pressure on her condition.
"It may have been thought that my corporate sponsor is the author of the paper-surgeon of Kleenex.
Sometimes I thought they'd write on my superpowered rock?
"She cried?"
Why a wild war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first wave of wild war between China and the United States was grueling, and since the war was far from over, far from the end, in the long-term differences between countries can be for Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering China's main export stores, including solar panels, table and aluminium.
The most significant estimate took place this week when the new rates closed the batteries at a total of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) actually covering half of the tires that are found in the United States of China.
Each time Beijing responded in the same way by raising a recent rate of between five and ten percent on the American warehouse at $60 billion.
China's love for the United States is a symmetrical answer, and the second one will certainly lead to an economy or an eye.
To force Washington to give up, it needs to be deep in demand, but the public pressure before the U.S. is practically inappropriate for the Chinese leader Si Chi Chi Chi Chipin.
However, experts say that if Beijing is using the situation correctly, the US military pressure in the long term can support China by reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a rare economic event is much more dangerous than observers thought before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who specializes in Asia, in a research-analytical center of a new American security.
The Syrian "good" for the return of refugees, said the Minister of Prisons
Syria claims that it is ready to return refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Turning to the General Assembly, AAN Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mullam said the conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The U.S. continues to restore the area that was devastated by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for the return of refugees to the country where they were forced to leave behind the theory and led economic measures that were directed to improve their daily life and livelihoods.
AAN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
More than six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulum said that the Syrian regime was happy with the help of the overthrowing of the country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept assistance in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from the country that the farmers had established.
Europe won a victory in the Riyadh Cup in Paris
The European command won Cuba's radar in 2018, moving the US command with a final number of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in Paris, France.
The United States has been playing six times in Europe and has not won the Riyadh Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe received the crown even more when Captain Thomas Bourne's command took 14.5 points needed for victory over the United States.
The American Star Phil Mikalsan, who most of the time won the tournament, caught his sword in water on 3rd of July 16, meeting this match of France's Malinary.
The Italian Gallicist Malinary played excellently on all sides, making one of the four players who went through this field with the number 5-0-0 since the beginning of the tunnel in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan List was killed by a number of 5 and 4 players with the lowest retina in the European Command, Thornbourn Olsen from Denmark.
The most popular player in the world, Dustin Johnson, played 2 and 1 John Paulter from England, who may have played in his last guitar.
The Veteran with eight radiar cubes the Spaniard of Sergei Garcia made himself a player who has more than all the winnings on tournaments with a career number 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't work.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to go back to the kitchen.
It's all about command, and I'm glad I could help," said the removed Garcia after the defeat of the European command.
He passed the estaphate to his land of John Ramu, who played the legend of the American Gulf of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single match 2&1.
"I am very grateful for having won at Tiger Woods, a man, for the career I've earned from childhood," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has won all his four mats in France and now has a record number 13-21-3 in the radiar cube.
Strange statistics of one of the biggest players all the time, who won 14 main games and left this show only by Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. command came with the exception of Patrick Ride, Justin Thomas, and Tenny Finns, who played all the tournaments with the excellent golf course.
US Captain Jim Furry said after an amazing game in defense of his command: "I admire these guys, they're beat.
This morning, we have sometimes shown Europe what we can do.
We won.
I'll take the hats to honor Thomas.
He's a big captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Gulf Association and our Radar Cup Company, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud that I'm their captain.
Take a picture of them.
We have been betrayed."
