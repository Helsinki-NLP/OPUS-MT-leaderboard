There was a 9-year-old boy in the temple with the priests.
The police have had to search for a 9-year-old boy because of the kidnapping of Tampere as a hostage in the night.
The announcement of the disappearance of a child from Western Tampere on the move with his friends has been published in the social media.
According to the police department, the boy has been contacted, and he has no life and health risks.
The boy's father told the night Samim to know that the boy's been found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the follow-up.
The boy found out about the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again hurjana - a repi painting of the Messiah
Cristian Ronaldo took five medals in Spain for a week and continued to perform at the Mister’s.
The bond between Lionel Messin and Christian Ronaldo from the Mestars to the Mestrians became at least a temporary success.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the bottom of all the age-old landscapes, when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk on the network two pieces of criminal activity and one game room.
Ronaldo was in his 80s, before he joined him in a settlement in Barcelona Messil with 77 pieces.
Real won the prize 4-0.
Juventus has since been computered in the Italian football game in Series A, but in the Mestria area, it started with a strong 2-1-way gun from Manchester City.
The battalion took ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack broke down the serotype of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, in the weekend of the election, came to the village for the last ten minutes.
In the Netherlands, the United States also experienced severe PSV Endhovena suffering from 1-2 seizures.
When ManU's 20-year-old vice-president Luke Shaw's visit, he's always just waiting.
The PSV's dangerous movement of Hector Moren became so dangerous that the attack against the ManU package was so bad that Shaw would probably be in the wrong place.
Shaw skere at Eindhoven's home at ten minutes before the medical staff took him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay will take you to a 41-minute drive, but ManU's joy lasts only a few minutes.
Moreno died before he fell asleep at the age of seven.
The PSV’s subsidiary, Luciano Narsingh, was the second half of the party.
On the ground floor of the Mestres, the Paris Saint-Germain, was set up in the area of the Mestres.
In the case of Manchester United's successor to the PSG, Angel Di Maria was replaced by Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria moved right through the palace to the end of Malmö World War I, Johann Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made another half player to PSG 2-0.
PSG has been weakened by a large number of long-term successes.
The situation is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best possible comparison.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, PSG's major actor, first met Zlatan Ibrahimvic at his professional career in Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmös in 1999.
Roman Eremenko saved 90 minutes when his team of Moscow TsSKA disappeared from the B-class in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded an immediate difference - the president was speaking in the wrong way
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe spoke the same language he had been holding months ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has spoken again in the country's parliament in the same speech that he had at the end of the last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe evidently did not speak the same language.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full power.
The MDC’s main party called for Mugabe to be separated from its task because this is too old to be managed.
The assistants of Mugaben were quick to say that the defeat had occurred only in Mugabe's presence and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben's speech was discussed earlier and now China's impact on the economy.
Germany and Austria wish to attend a comprehensive conference on refugee crises
Germany and Austria have introduced the summit of EU leaders for the first week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council for Summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Association, the Heads of State, Angela Merkel, should discuss cooperation with non-member countries and how they will be better able to obtain more effective registration.
The negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers are part of the internal ministerial meeting, according to Merkel.
The teacher will give her amputation during the emergency call
I'm just saying a few color university professor Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police should come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "cult dog" is alive and probably confused, and said that the contact of a woman’s neighbors is found on this phone.
In the room, the police found a message written on Amy Prentiss' body and anger: "I'm so sorry that I could take this love Amy and he's the only woman who's ever loved me," said the letter that experts have signed Lambine.
No mention was made that Lamb, who taught two online courses in Minnesota, Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school camp where the police believed in his nephew and killed his teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this working room.
Delta State University police officer Lynn Buford told university officials about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
He told Lambi to call his lawyer some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of dead had risen again: Lamb had committed suicide by limiting himself to the police.
The authorities were still trying to figure out the reasons for Lambi’s day after the students and staff had to go behind closed doors because of the school shooting.
The researchers in both parts of the state have published information that students and staff described Lambia as a gift teacher, which, however, may have been a problem.
The students told him they were waiting for his feelings.
The president of the death camp, Gautier, the police say that Lambi had no violent history or crime record.
Schmidt himself had included Lambi's writing in his book, where he thanked "adorable people", with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught community data and history at a facility with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of each man.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers called Lambia, but he said that he was also affected by the nervousness and the spread of it, "no matter what it was like to have been in the shower."
Another student, Michael Sykes, told Lambine that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked a patient from Delta State University to say that he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's wage principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard in front of his doctorate, it did not recognize him as an automatic development and assistant professor's office.
Dr. William LaForge of the University said that there was no difference between Lambin and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in Lambi's mind."
The Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb was thrown out of the camp, the police came after him when he moved back from Mississippi to Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself in a .38-calypse gun at the back of a room about a mile south of his parents' house in the city of Mississippi Greenville, told the dying researcher in Washington, D.C., Methel Johnson.
The Lamb's car was still on the ground.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he thought Lamb knew people living there.
Lamb's been waiting in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and learned the country and growth rate. There are 3500 students at the university and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb worked in the medical certificate in the summer.
One of Lambine's old friends described him as smart, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston told her that she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 when they met with fellow friends.
A friend of Hairston was in the library, and Lamb was a happy, older friend who had been trying to learn to call Hairston for years.
He was a little hormonal at those times.
All the girls were deaf when he was in his place, he now told 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson City, Brandon.
Well, Lamb and Prentiss were obviously out of line for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb told his wife that he had killed her, but their marriage has no evidence.
They had a bright-eyed dog who lived with them in a railway station in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was okay.
Prentiss me, former husband Shawn O'Steen told them 15 years ago, but he's still a friend, and he's got a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described to his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said she didn't meet Lambia, but she had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb had been interested in music and called the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when Lamb and Abigail were both present on the central market three years ago.
Later, they called together in a few kitchens.
O'Steen said her daughter's making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different web companies.
The Julep Room bar, located near Gautier, and the temporary successor, Mike Shaffer, told him that he saw Lambin and Prentiss at the last night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and hairdryer presentation to the harpy general.
Nothing made me feel like I was in hell.
"I'm a happy couple," he said.
We went on, and we broke up with each other.
So they were both pretty close to each other.
The dead teacher Schmidt conducted a first-year seminar program for students and had specialized in the history of the Indians and the transitions, told school English Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married, and he had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas Emporia State, as well as as as the president of his community and the School Board of Directors.
On Tuesday in Cleveland, Delta State camp was held, with about 900 people involved, including education and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt’s wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the event during which the University of Music sang songs at Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching goes on in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to get our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
Now's the time to make a move.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police are now saying that Lambi's emergency call was called after Schmidt was shot, and that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss' wife during the call, there is no evidence that they would have been married.
Toys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers to the Lomé.
Toys R Us says that it does not pay as many workers as in the last year, but the repeaters of toys and baby products say that the opportunity is given to modern-day confirmed and long-term workers to make more sense.
According to the company, it plans to employ 40 000 people in traffic and distribution centres in different parts of the country when there were 45,000 employed in 2014.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the questionnaires of the applicants began this month, and the number of staff rose from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months, the harvest season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the sale, sale and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox looks at his "treffet" with Princess Diana
Back in the future, Michael J. Fox had an important moment in his life.
It was also significant for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for royal arrivals, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I thought that in Princess Diana's place was near me," he said the next documentary in the back in Time trailer.
The film begins and I think I'm just in the middle of an attack and a hand-crazy meeting with Princess Wallace.
Back in Time is a document back to the future, which was challenged by Foxia, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloydia, as well as by Robert Zemeckis and producer director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, she got her first-born 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "I think it's an excellent timer picture of all times."
Back in Time is available on a free video, DVD and some movies in October.
The UN leader says the situation in Syria is not to be resolved by the armed forces
President Ban Ki-Mono's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "does not resolve armed" and adds only to the suffering of violence and millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations called again on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
In a midweek press conference, Ban said he was going to meet with five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - Foreign Ministers at the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the Council, the people of Syria and the distribution of regional forces "have made the situation impossible."
The Bank called on the five remaining Member States to demonstrate their solidarity and unity in dealing with the Syrian crisis, as demonstrated by the agreement of the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 support questionnaires showing that Donald Trump is real
Some have tried not to see him as a virus.
Others just like him.
Some are waiting for a break.
Although some Republicans have tried to delay Donald Trumpia from the survey of support issues, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In the last 11 national issues, Donald Trump has been led by a two-digit chapter, and some have started seriously with a view to what this means for the names of the property King.
The choice is right at the beginning.
These results do not yet mean that from Trump, it is likely that the Republican will be subject to the conditions of the Republican.
The commentators note that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing its leadership to Herman Cain, who had not both received any State participation in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general.
However, foreign groups, such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have taken note of the sinisterness of Trump and began to use his money to lose him.
The following recent applications for asylum refer to the fact that the final stage of the residence is not the only stage:
The Trump's recommendations have been made.
Just before Donald Trump announced his proposal in the middle of June, Monmouth University's support questions showed that only two of the ten republics had a positive attitude toward the construction industry.
By mid-June, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, there are six of the ten Republicans who are welcome to Donald Trumpi.
About three out of ten says they're treating each other harshly.
These lists also take place in the first priority countries.
In a survey at the University of Quinnipic in Iowa last week, 60 percent of the Republicans said they were in favour of Trumpi.
Two-thirds of the Republican citizens would be pleased if the Trumps were to be asked.
In the CNN/ORC issue last week, 67 per cent of the Republican population said they would either be "innovated" or "problems", if Trump was willing.
Only two of the ten said that they would be "sounded" if they were to offer him an offer.
Only Ben Carson gets at the same level of enthusiasm at the same time as Trump (43% "innovated" vs. Trump 40%).
Next thing you want to do, what's going on?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "satisfied", if they were to offer the recommendations of the Governors from Jeb Bush.
There is no problem with the coming nature of Trumpa, most of the Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpa has been widely criticized for his excellent speech and speech, according to ABC News/Washington’s Post, 52 per cent of the national voters in the Republic at the national level think that the seat of the President of the House of Commons is a suitable nature for the President.
According to Quinnipiac's survey last week, the figure in the first half-session was the same: 52 per cent of Republican people think Trump has the right nature for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Post, 44 per cent consider that his nature does not apply to the functioning of the President, and almost six out of ten are of the opinion that his nature does not belong to the White House.
The representatives of the Republican people are thinking.
When representatives of the Republican people think as commentators, they feel that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC questionnaire, four out of ten likely options were to be considered by the Republicans to be the most likely candidate.
By the end of July, four of the ten supported Jeb Bush.
Data publication: The Republican party's voters have not always had a potential crystal ball in their use.
The last election of four of the ten Republicans at this time was that Rick Perry was appointed as a candidate, and only 28 per cent supported the final proposal, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the voters in the Republican Party consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Although the Republicans were determined to support another candidate, Trump would win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the Overseas Land is likely to have contributed to the leadership of Trump, as the anti-Trup support has been shared between numerous other candidates.
However, at the beginning of September, the question raised by Monmouth University, however, showed that in a hypothetical two-way crisis between Trump and almost all other republican candidates, Trump will receive more support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bushia at 19 points, and Rand Paula, John Kasichi and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
He's with Ted Cruz on the sidewalk.
Is that how Trumpin can't get a candidate?
If they were to be set against, Ben Carson would defeat Mr. Trump's 18-point difference.
Only the majority of the supporters of Donald Trump have been informed of their decision.
The new CBS/NYT questionnaire shows that only a few more than half of the supporters of Trump have decided who will vote.
The situation can, of course, change, and no one can absolutely say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent said they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trumpin's biggest competitors are now another unlikely winner, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but those voters who said their decision are twice more likely on the part of Trump.
Six of the ten Republicans say they share the same view of migration with Trump.
Since two months ago, Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants in the campaign's "grandmother" conversation, the country's migration has been in the middle of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned about the fact that the Tromp’s power is causing Latin voices to become more distant from the Republican side and harming the re-insurance companies.
According to a new ABC/Post questionnaire published today, six out of ten Republicans share the same opinion on immigration with Trump.
So it turns out that as long as migration is in the middle of things, so is Donald Trump.
The market economy in the government has reached a new threshold.
The support of Donald Trumpin and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their political position outside the country.
Six of the ten Republicans said in the country's ABC/Post question that they prefer to choose a political outsider than a government hearing.
They are also hostile to the Government of the United States.
Two weeks' return to Des Moines Register/Bloomberg revealed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa have been destroyed at the Republican Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% "very angry".
Jeremy Corby's priority at the Prime Minister's question
Corbyn's priority is to be eagerly expected from his selection
The new director of the Labour Department, Jeremy Corby, met David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's question.
Corbyn raises his first six questions after a few afternoons, and probably both media and working party citizens confirm his performance.
Corbyn has demanded this weekend to show "better theatre and more facts".
She has also said that she could leave some of the opportunities to take care of her colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leader after he was appointed to the custody and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Organization of Professional Associations.
At the same time, the decision of the Head of the Labour Party to remain silent during the National Security Service, which was organized on the 75th anniversary of the British War, has raised appreciation for the Conservative Party's role in several cases.
Corbyn’s decision to be silent has raised its concern about national singing
The representative of Corbyin said that his "extraordinary silence" and that he recognises "the threat of royal air in the ison-British atmosphere."
Mr Owen Smith, a member of Corbyin's Security Council, pointed out to the BBC Twon Newsnight programme that he would have called on the director of the part of the job, even though he felt he should stop at the Kingdom Hall.
Nearly a thousand foreign ministers have refused to be involved in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union in economic, defence and external affairs, and under six months of parliament, he was supported as leader.
BBC policy editor Robin Brant says that the lines on the position of the side in the European Union and the government's aid fund have also been "used" after the appointment of Corbyn within the working party.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Central Organization of Professional Associations that the working party would present a change that would remove the entire loss.
A few years later, the Secretary of Labour and Housing of the Security Council, Smith, said that the party was "very clear" as to the fact that they were only opposed to the government's plans to cover a total of 26 000 points 230000 points.
Corbyni will be the fifth head of the working party, which David Cameron has met during the last decade, during which he has been the head of the conservative party.
The employer has promised a new approach to the policy and now tells us that he has "convened" ideas to the Prime Minister and has received over 30,000 proposals.
President Corbyn of the Islington North has said that the nature of the prime minister's polls is too controversial and that he is going to be held in custody both by harsh words and by the fact that it is allowed to focus on serious issues such as poverty, differentiality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that economic manager Angela Eagle is acting in his place at the time of Corby's absence - for example when Cameron's outside.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues may at times be allowed to use the speakers, and he has said from the team that he is close to the bottom of the room, John Bercowia.
When Cameron grew up in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often accompanied by the Prime Minister's comments, but later he had to admit his failure.
From the time they were started to television in 1990, the prime minister's questionnaire has been an important measure in assessing the ability of the director, his management of his premises, and his position among other citizens, even though the assessors have criticised the fact that they have become only vague, which requires long-term reforms.
Pictures in Joburg: Incredible young people are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is going to be a place of residence.
However, a group of former boys have found a way to learn skills and increase their lives.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a winning unintended studio where young people are taught how to take pictures in their neighborhood and get it won.
BBC News met one of the first young people in the project.

Red value increases in the rate of employment in the United Kingdom
The red value fell to the top after the numbers showed rise in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose from SABMille.
During the period between October and July, the wages of Ison-British, including the bonus, increased by 2.9 per cent at the same time during the last year.
The growth rate was rapidly post-2009 and was considered to have been assessed with respect to the reduction of the rates.
The point rose by over a percentage against $1,555 and EUR 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index was closed by 149 per cent to read 6229.21.
SABMiller was a separate market share and increased by 20 per cent after it was offered by the competitor AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two major pressures from the world and other fuels such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry share increased by 0.9% after the competitive luxury industry group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales volumes were expected to be better, and they also showed that sales in China, which are the open market in Burberry, had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s share increased by 5 per cent after the buyer said it had reduced $2.5 billion by counting the shares to move as part of its debt strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi shares were the largest in the index in 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation from a company in the form of "my".
JD Sports increased by 3.1 per cent after the company published the production of information in half a year before tax: 83 per cent increased by 46.6 million points.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
JD Sports, director of the company Peter Cowgill, says that if the minimum wage of workers is lifted in the UK, it can mean "the growth of potential consumers' purchasing power".
However, this purchaser is probably not above the higher labour costs collected for the company, Cowgill realizes.
Costs could be addressed to the expansion plans of the company, which he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash begins the campaign on Aldin's campaign against torture
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA son from Aldin's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash food supplements have launched a food chain campaign to defend IGA’s market share in South and West Australia before the attack of Aldin $700 million.
Aldi prepares two distribution units and the first opening of the trade first in South and Western Australia, where there are up to 120 trades. At the same time, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food users and build IGA brands through the wholesale and social media market, as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA's traders and buyers have agreed, and fuels such as Dunsborough's future producer Simmo's offer pets in IGA's shops, and shop owners sell discounts to customers on Australian football.
Metcashi is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when it organises support for food, alcohol and railways on the annual day of the investor strategy.
There is a lot in the game, as South and Western Australia totals nearly 30 per cent of the Metcash IGA area, and the product margins are higher than the IGA network of the parent countries of Metcash.
The purchases of South-East Australia are known for foreign exchanges, and IGA resellers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the south and 24 per cent in the east compared to 14 per cent in the former countries.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will drop about 5 per cent of these two countries' food markets within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA's resellers can spend up to $360 million a year on sales and Metcash can spend 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This prophecy is based on the hope that Aldi will open up trades first in the year 25 and 30 in the south, resulting in 500 and 600 million exchanges in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and rates in the area of the high cost of Metcashi can pay Metcashi approximately $13 million for trade-offs prior to peaks and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash has market share in the former countries mainly for Aldi and Coles, although the recent study of Roy Morgan revealed that IGA’s customers were all more faithful.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food and food consumption will decrease by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the Managing Director of the Investment Bank and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at the Metcash Chamber in Melbourne that Metcash could "as far as possible destroy within ten years".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcashi Government should have contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has been reduced by 18% since 2010, and products from the Metcashi food and food business, which focuses on about 1200 IGA customers, have decreased by 43% since 2012. This tells us that debt management is reduced when it comes to sales and marginalities.
However, it is worth half of it, and has invested more than $150 million per year on a weekly basis in the price of hundreds of products at the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to improve their sales by increasing the price of food faster, and by bringing better selectable products to the market.
Metcashi, President Ian Morrice, says that the calculation of prices and the adjustment of sales has increased veto power, and he hopes that the aid will return to the growth of the products in 2017, for the first time in four years.
President of the Australian tennis club Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more respect than criticism for its use
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a victim of a recent drought, which has broken his friend Nick Kyrgios around. He deserves more respect than the criticism of his own practice, reports Australian tennis Federation President Steve Healy.
A gift called "Special Ks" from two younger members of the Kokkinakis had to be made available to the public in a case in which Kyrgios was admiring Stan Wawrinkaa Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in the upcoming prison camp in Cincinnati, the final officer had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison from each other when Harrison announced: "Wowrinka should have hit Kyrkgios, and I should have hit that cat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen in the ruins of his country after the cracking of his possible victory by Richard Gasquetti in the US Open, Healy has been an innocent defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Grothin from another location with Bernard Tomic in the British semi-finals of Davis Cupin.
"I'm pretty sure of the idea that Thanas is only watered in a little bit," said Healy.
He broke his mail to destroy the cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when it's broken, and I know Thanas needs to know that he's not proud of it.
But he's used a great deal, too, in almost provable situations with the US Opens Harrison and still, and I think he deserves injuries.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been hit a little hard.
He's a very capable 19-year-old, he works hard, according to the team and so on, and he's never had problems with other players. He's appreciated in the chat room, he's doing hard, he's good, he's really good, and he's very peaceful and capable of being a young man, and I think he should evaluate them according to his reasons.
Healy has also supported the decision not to take the important games that began as a spring from Kyrgyzstan, describing this "common decision" for all of your good solutions, but nevertheless supported the canberral return to the insurance company.
"We want to be a team fully focused on games and not all of the non-mec [Kyrgios] around," Healy said.
And Nick's got really fast, as Federer and Murray have noticed, and he's grown up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all of his criticism. But we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and if he's sometimes taking away these consequences from the public.
European immigration crisis: Hungary publishes emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared an exception and closed the southern border of Serbia with those who tried to come to the country illegally. The aim is to defeat the foreign forces that will come to the country.
At the border, hundreds of immigrants were forced into an unreceptive area, and Serbia's authorities responded with silence.
People who have been embroiled in domestic violence have now been able to set up their headquarters and set up an indefinite period of time between the two countries.
However, there was an increase in anxiety.
While the police helicopter remained on their side, the immigrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted out loud to the Hungarian melkapolies.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister announced that it is an "unacceptable" return of immigrants from Hungary as they get more from Macedonia and Greece all the time.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of a solution, not cause damage to citizens.
The debate must be held in the near future with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The Sekasorto was born between Hungary and Serbia following the failure of the 28 Nationality Group to establish a common immigration policy at an adequate meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers were of the same opinion as the 40 000 asylum seekers, who are now in charge of Italy and Greece. The Ministers spoke actively about reaching the final agreement - first month or the end of the year - about what EU countries take from 120 000 additional seats, including from Hungary.
Germany's Federal Republic of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, are demanding a summit of the EU for the first week to discuss the country's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not wish its neighbours or Brussels to act in the near future.
In the two south-eastern regions, the authorities were given greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be shut down and the security forces could be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that aid is available at Serbia's borders, the country is also going to be able to allow a long-term share of aid to Romania against its borders to stop immigrants from coming to the country.
CBS News writer Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners had been colored by their last visit between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and access point for the refugees of the European Union, many of whom are fighting in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of the beneficiaries are economically in the pursuit of a better life, and not the refugees who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly disputed with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new devices that came into force in Hungary are now defined as a criminal offence over or damage to the company by 4 metres (13 feet) of length, which the government has built against the southern border of Serbia, as well as contain further criminal penalties for convicted human beings.
"Because of the situation of mass change, the Hungarian government publishes an emergency," the government reporter Zolta Kovacs told reporters in the city of Szeged.
In fact, we are very clear: overstepping the line is a crime.
Parliament must still formally accept the war situation expected for the first week, but at the level of the Associated Press Providers, they have seen a heavy-armed military personnel armed with vehicles and guns for days.
Orban’s domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had arrested 45 people while they were trying to cross the border, and 15 more to the farthest part of the country.
They have been able to do more harm, they are now a police prisoner, and they are accused of crimes defined in the new laws.
Officials are quick to help.
On Tuesday, the Hungarian authorities also shut down two seven out of the border against Serbia after they had sent one of these places to the border.
Close to the destination location of Hungary, Russia was hidden in a cave when the Hungarians opened a metal count for the treatment of the people and gathered the forces inside.
About 20 came in, but thousands remained outside.
A group of immigrants supported the main engines between Serbia and Hungary saying they refused to eat and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 options: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has been disappointed
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues in the two-digit leadership of democracy, but Senator Bernie Sanders has arrested him.
Clintonia now supports 47 per cent of democratic voters (58 per cent) and another 27 per cent of Sandersia supports the new 17 per cent.
The vice-president Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidency, but he will support 15 per cent of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the first phase, most of the democratic voters are saying that they have been too long to say that they would have decided who they were voting.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand behind their choice, rather than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's preference has been reduced in several groups in the last month following a CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader of women and Maltese couples, but his leadership is disappointed.
His recommendation in the couple of men has been greatly reduced, and Sanders is only 5 percent of the units behind.
Clinton's progress has been lost in the ranks of democratic voters under 50 years of age, and he is now at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly responsible for several older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sandersia with a tube tube tube in a liberal pair, but now Sanders leads this group by five percent.
About half of the country's Democrats say they support Clintonia with zeal if they come from the side of the country.
Fourthly, he said he supported him with some savings, and 15 percent would only support him because he was willing.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more consistent with those who do not currently support Clintonia - only four of them would support her intensely.
In which 48 per cent of democratic voters say they would support Clintonia with zeal, the Republican co-author Donald Trumpi says the same thing is the Republican voter (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a proposal, the recommended answer was that he had an appropriate experience (16 per cent). Afterwards the most recommended responses were that it is now the right time for the president (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions and the possibility of complaint were also mentioned.
As the vice-president is affected by the possible presidential election, 57 per cent of the democratic voters would like to see him in the trial, even though there is a difference of opinion between them.
In the question of democratic voters, who chose the second half of the list, Biden has recommended a choice.
In the middle of Clinton's supporters, over half said that they chose Biden, which is much more recommended than Sanders.
If Biden decides to be unintended for democracy, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sandersi. If Biden leaves, the direction is 20%, but if he leaves, the figure is 30.
55% of Democrats believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning presidential elections, but this figure has fallen by 78% in recent months.
This measure of Biden remains long, but the proportion of those who consider him to be more vocal has grown.
When democratic voters were asked what is most important on the proposal, however, they raised opinions on the need to vote.
No democratic candidate or potential candidate has been considered impossible for these voters in the past month.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates will be able to reach a certain level of progress in the medium of the voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sandersia and Bidenia to be real, reliable and strong leaders.
By the way, the Biden is in the best possible reality, while Clinton's strength is a guide.
30 per cent of the Democrats say they do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, which is twice as common as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrats also generally consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be ideologically the same opinion.
When we look at all these pieces, about a quarter of the Democrats say they don't have any opinion about Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail and the use of a servant as a foreign minister continues to raise questions, most Democrats are satisfied with his explanation and say that the issue did not affect their public opinion.
However, it's different when it's considered America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third of them are satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided in March shortly after the day came.
Most Americans say that the e-mails did not affect their entire membership of Clinton, even though 36 percent said that their opinions were wrong about him.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their views on Clinton have changed worse.
Although Clinton's own voices consider him to be honest and reliable, this is a problem for him in the middle of all recorded voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has been calculated 8 percent in the last month and 15 percent in May.
62% of registered voters say they do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, Clintonia and Trump are considered a good leader.
The six candidates included in the study are considered more realistic.
Sanders are usually considered to be real, but many don't have his opinion, just like Carson's.
In a study involving 351 Democrats, the previous margin is 6 per cent.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trumpie on the national issue
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trumpin on the latest CBS News/New York Time
Two of the candidates gathered in the new issue, half of all voices, leaving others fighting for the Russians.
Through the Republican representatives, the country continues to be strongly supported by Trump, whose support has grown steadily before the last month of Fox News's CBS's 23 per cent issue, which has been published on the 27 per cent issue.
However, Carson grew from six percent to 23 percent at the same time.
The question also found that Carson is very different from the demographic groups and has been discriminated against in the midst of the majority of the representatives of the Republican High Schools in Trump.
The finals of the village have been left, with the exception of Carly Fiorinaa and Ohio Governor John Kasichi. Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker's support has been calculated most: the last 10 per cent of the current 2 per cent in the last month.
Former Florian Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6 per cent.
In the case of the newest, September, 376 republican voter, the previous margin is +/-6 per cent.
Last week's latest issue of CNN/ORC showed Carson's rise in the issue: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is still 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post question, Trump was significantly ahead of Carsonia.
At Carson's suggestion last week, Trump criticized her marriage for remaining neurosurgery, even though Carso asked for forgiveness for the question of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last night in a campaign show in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of the first year of Baruch College.
Nearly two years after the student died at the funeral ceremony in the Pocono Mountain region of Pennsylvania, five people were killed.
In New York City, the members of the Baruch College of Pi Delta Psi Association went publicly during the term "Michael" Deng in September 2013 and then rushed to his hospital after his death, and the police identified him.
The authorities say that Dening’s eyes were bound and his eyes were covered with more than 13 kilograms of hair, and then he was taken back to the ground again when he tried to walk through the rest of the hole towards the ground.
In the end, Deng chose to hit his head, and then he lost his mind.
The members of the brotherhood did not call the emergency number Deng, but they were waiting for an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Dengi's clothes to look for information on his suffering on the network, and to contact the national president of the brotherhood, Andy Mengi, who asked about this advice, and police officer Chris Wagner told the press office.
"At this point the members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, fixed the welfare of the brotherhood for Michael Deng," said police officer Wagner.
I can't handle the case, and he died the next morning.
According to the Red Cross, Deng was restored to the dust of his head, guard and travel.
"A large number of families have had to suffer from a brother-in-law attack, when at least one student died each year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a representative of the Dening family.
Brothers and their families must be responsible, and this is an important step towards the authorities.
A large company in the Monroe region was involved in the fact that the first five members were charged with the murder of the third stage.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also responsible for the violence and criminal ban.
"We do not want to be responsible only for individuals. If there is an organization behind the situation that has accepted the situation either officially or informally, they must also be held responsible," Wagner stated in a press release.
Baruch College rejected the association of the brotherhood and the national brotherhood as a local party.
This happens when the United States Central Bank raises its share of debt
There will be an alarming rise, and the market for rising rates will collapse, the production of mass dividends will rise, and the economy will continue to deteriorate.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this whole thing goes or how long it lasts.
History does not just help with the timing of what is going to be called the economy.
The Danish income has endured only 11 months after the first climb, sometimes for more than 86 months.
In the United States, the aggressiveness of the central bank in the rise of peaks has often, although not always, been determined by how economics and financial resources react.
Therefore, the United States Central Bank officials have stressed that investors should not focus on the rise of peaks, but rather on the normalization of the situation in the medium term.
There's really a lot of change in this society.
In the end, however, market parties may find that all mergers involving coronation have been exceeded.
"The first rise in the global economic crisis in the Central Bank is without a doubt to be interpreted in some areas for the end of the period of 'severe money'," said the Global Economics Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Julian Jessop, in a letter to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the United States of America’s slow pace will turn to normal, even if it is still low, to such a degree that many feel afraid.
However, this does not mean that it does not have effects.
There is a look at how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of previous development:
As has been seen on the market in the last about a month, waiting for the rise of the horn can make the situation uncertain.
When it comes to reality, the effect is not so dramatic.
"It appears that the capital product has a tendency to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which is likely to reopen five in monetary policy," the Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the central bank collapse.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, about 14 per cent rising from growth, 250 days after that situation is relatively level (mean increase of 2.6 per cent), and normality has been achieved in the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycle, reported in a brief analysis of the capital strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management company Bob Dollin published in Barron's chapters.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer in the later stage of the heating system when the products start to fall.
The goals are part of the economy, but pride often promotes their future.
In the present situation, the central bank has even some problems that have not been before and which can be encouraged to be touched.
In particular, this is a gross domestic product that must be almost at the lowest level of all times before the central bank collapses.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118th anniversary of the 1950s, the nominal annual GDP was less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, it is rarely believed that it remained when the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the United States Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
The rise of the peaks in this terrible economic situation can be risky and raise the question of whether "this is different this time", Deutsche Bank said.
The market parties have maintained the central bank’s growth throughout the year, and all are waiting for a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends in the storm.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, the Futour Prize is only 25% likely.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all the growth cycles have been shown in the second place in the supercycles where BKT has stopped putting its forward immediately after life has begun," the report reports.
On the other hand, at the start of the day, there has been an exceptional slowing of the tanning process, which has been worse than the discovery.
The current central bank has been waiting for the most recent end of the battle: the forecast has been 35 months, and now is already in the course of 74 months.
The solid product has also been uncertain in the expectation of market coherence, and the model reminds some of the findings made by the company's capital.
The point is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are seen in debt flows faster than in shares.
The direction of the glass products appears to vary immediately according to the first thickness/mixture of the cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, the product of debt will immediately fall," Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that the rise of peaks leads to closer to the products of longer- and shorter-term debt rates, thus reducing production deficits.
High-ranking batches often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still careful about the first relationship of the product", according to a solid product analysis by Schwaby in some analysis by Kathy Jones.
It's surprising yes, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's linemaps.
"In addition to the decrease in the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, there are many signs that the market has adapted to the more stringent aspects of monetary policy," he wrote.
The short-term curves are high, the production rate is higher, the credit margin has increased and uncertainty has increased - all of these are private markets when the central bank has increased its line.
In general, by taking companies whose business is mainly invested in the United States, they will win when the prices rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-stakeholder companies that have a lot of debt are doing worse when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products expensive on the world market and their profits become more expensive than they have financial resources.
"Historic history shows that the "quality" shares are usually the most productive in the first three months after the completion," Goldman Sachsin analysts pointed out to customers in their report.
Enterprises with a strong trade change ended up in a five-percent unit after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 surges.
Enterprises with high capital production and low-voltility shares were better developed than low-level enterprises. The mean mentioned above was 4 (percent units) and 3 (percent units).
It's gonna be a big problem for the brother.
Those companies that have a lot of variable charges are losing most, Goldman said.
There is also an opportunity for consumers to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Rescuers can also be won by larger products, even though experts agree on how fast the impact is.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, citizen Andrew Bingham says
Conservative director Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "citizening"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor will become even more difficult.
In addition, he met BBC Music Awards saying they were just visiting Brit Awards.
With the president, Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying that it is not the same
BBC Radio 3 is "modification" for Classic FM, claiming that the leader of the company adds the pressure of the company to prove that it does something that commercial companies do not do.
Conservative director Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an impact on the content of the "manufacturer" and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish itself from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "citizens" - is changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also took the lead in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"Last year's BBC Music Awards are only influenced by different names from the British Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two direct examples of what I remember when you actually just copied something out of the market," Bingham said.
The president of the BBC condemned the claim that BBC Radio 3 is a long way ahead of its commercial competitors to live music and to share information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn anything else.
In fact, its commitment to live music and music is of primary importance.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and finding new works," he said.
Earlier this year, head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the canal had to do more work than before for the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was critical of the arrest of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
The music competition, which the BBC purchased from the Dutch company Talpa Medial, was criticized by the conservative representative Damien Collins.
Do you understand why I often discuss this programme, because it is not original and it is not any personal?
Lordy Hall claimed that this BBC1 program, which works as a major milestones in Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced in "the style of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the company to "find success within its own room" the next time it started a spring.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future causes of The Voice, or to determine that the money of the beneficiaries would be used in other late forms.
Networking rose second in August at least, Black Friday may be a cause
Networking increased by 7% in 2015 in the first three months of 2015
In the last month, there was a decline after the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years later, the network came to an end with the use of mobile devices for purchases.
Experts believe that in November, Black Friday may delay spending
The production of plant products has recently increased over a decade and has changed many of Britain’s purchases into burning cities.
However, the respondents say that the air is now marked by the rate of netting when the latest figures showed only 7 per cent increase for the first year of 2015.
The total consumption in August was then below the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase since the last year.
Experts say that the climate is marked by the rate of net pollution when the latest figures showed only 7 per cent increase for the first year of 2015.
"If we look at the growth rates for more years and return to the year 2000, it was clear that the situation would be reasonable within a time limit," the supplier of the JMRG sales index told Guardian.
He explained that three years later the network came to a halt when the buyers began using their mobile phones for purchases.
It meant that many people made purchases on the network, and that they could be made in different environments, as in the case of salt.
But now it's equal, and (growling) can count.
From America, Black Friday's climate has been considered one reason behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers are slowing down before the last spring of November.
In recent years, the average value is five times more than the purchaser’s average price to sell a lot of sales online to computers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got the buyers ready to find the find, can stop the purchase.
In a survey published by the British Retail Consortium, only one point was used on the network.
More than three purchases are now made on the website of certain products, such as television and washing machines.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using purchased manufacturers.
The Muslims defeat Meka's deaths in the absence of torture, the consequences for Bin Laden's family
The Muslims placed 29 bodies of dead bodies in the bones of the first healers in Mexico
Saudi Arabia has partly charged the construction of Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that in total, 394 people were injured when the tumor fell below.
29 The dead were cast into the lake of fire, and hundreds of Muslims were gathered together to bury them: and the dead were gathered together when the tower fell in the great valley of Mekah.
In fact, the dead who had been beaten by white were on the way to honor the first dead who had made their last trip to Al-Moaisse's grave.
The terrible journey ended in a holy place, where just a few days later, the swastika broke through the mosque’s walls and broke down to worship.
The bodies were released to be buried when King Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden’s family as a criminal disaster, which also affected 394 people.
The bodies of 29 bodies from the bodies of the cataclysmic cataclysm in the Meka were carried off by cats
In the group of dead, Qasim Akram was the father of four children from the Boltons of Manchester, who was the first to be separated from the church when the tower fell.
Akram had been in a large mosque with his parents before the start of the annual anti-Smoking ban.
The Saudi authorities have already claimed that the Gulf of Mecca will continue as thousands continue to reach the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group shouldn't have left the nest before it was in operation.
In an Arabic version of the decision published by the Government’s Saudi Press Agency, it was said that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
This detail was not mentioned in the English language service of the company, but it was said that the directors of the company had been prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman complained that he had found out, which led to the destruction of the occupiers, where hundreds of Muslims had gathered before the guinea pig fever in this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any information on the fraud of the victims, nor has its representatives been able to make a comment.
The Royal Decision also argued that it did not use time-consuming protective equipment and did not cooperate with the meteorology authorities.
Around the mega, there are dozens of nocturnals, which are part of the great building project led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi-Arab government family for decades, leading to large construction projects.
The former leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a capinal son who rejected the family in the 1990s.
It happened in the wind and in the sea, only days before millions of people reached the Kingdom for the sacredness of the kingdom, which every Muslim who is able to do must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities determined that a million riel (174,000 pounds) should be paid to the deceased’s owners and to the victims permanently.
Other broken downs will get half of this amount.
B&Q-promo says that European workers working in poor countries are advised back
Brits are using more and more auxiliary services, Veronique Lauriy says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe has risen again.
Follow-up screenfix buttons for professional users open 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q miles around the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, city editor for Daily Mail
It is said that British citizens are free of charge and that they pay their wages and are willing to pay their wages to make citizens of Europe.
It looks like if you're right with the left or you're going down the wall, you're at least right now.
Brits see more and more assist men to manage tee-se-itse jobs in their homes, reports the company's bomb behind B&Q.
The new President of the Kingfisher, who owns the Kokonnremonte Company, Veronique Lauriy, said that, on the basis of his recommendation, there is a number of workers from Eastern Europe who claim to have come from Europe and that they offer a price to pay.
This leads to Kingfisher planning his open 200 new hand-made Screwfix shop and closing 60 B&Q.
Lauriy said she wanted to add more women to work in B&Q, because eight out of ten shopping orders are called the most beautiful sexual acts.
Today most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more than one women's households that make more civilisations than ever before.
Laurie said, "The most important part of our sales are still men.
We need to get better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women have a great role in the decision-making process."
Laurie is one of only five women who are leading the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index, and she has rebuilt her leadership group so that there are a lot of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with 50 percent of women, including its principal and financial manager.
He said, "This was a certain decision - the difference here is an important matter.
There has been no difficulty finding good women in the leadership group."
Kingfisher reported the cost of closing low sales costs in both production and sales for a half year.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher owned by Screwfix and B&Q is opening 200 new traffic
The three governments recently decided to secure the proposed legislation in order to save the economy of the country.
The visible effects were soon reached.
The head of the SAK and other pension institutions began to pressure the same way and, as a result, the country stands out as a whole because of the broad opinion of the workers.
It's time for many people to think about it, too.
Let's ask ourselves if we're gonna be able to hang around when it's going bad.
It's even built up against the counter-trafficking.
More than 50,000 people in the network have already declared that they are not going to participate in the country of thought but go to work.
Such a good old consensus would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no net in which to protest, but openly declaring crime would have been a small political suicide.
Millions of professional organisations have little time to protest a few tens of thousands of people, but the subject of thought gives it.
The position of the trade union is no longer as clear as it was a year ago.
Not all are aware of the objectives of the movement, values have changed
In view of the interest of the Ay movement, the solutions of the government can also be seen as a wonderful gift from heaven.
When things have been going on for years, it seems that they have become increasingly self-depressed, that is, they are now late in the alliances, namely the rights of the worker to defend, clearly and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to take over the role of ay movement when the membership of the professional community is seen to be more important.
In any event, there is a need for organizations to stop Finland from doing anything they think they want.
Yes, Finland's stopped for a while ago.
For example, industrial production has been counted 31 months ago.
Gross imports continue to decrease, and unemployment continues to rise.
You thought all of these things were going to be hard on everyone.
Severe savings to the University of Lappeenland: Objective 8.5 million, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenrann will launch a life-threatening course aimed at costing a total of EUR 8.5 million.
In part, the University of the University will initiate the YT negotiations on the entire staff, with a total of 6.5 million targets per year.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 workers.
In addition, there are two million other activities to be saved.
In the context of the YT negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to fall by 8.5 million.
This also affects the government's accounting practices.
At this level, the university is making about 2.6 million of the result.
The expenditure will increase slightly in the first year, but the same funding from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and another funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total university budget is about EUR 85 million, so the target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
The impact of the distortions of mass education and research and the reduction of corporate funding on our university level is very important, says Dr. Anneli Paul in his report to the University of Applied Sciences.
Before long, the effects of delays were even more subtle, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears to be in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trusted men will be initiated in the first week of the week and will continue for a period of six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
The South Bus Company Onnibus's owner, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also responsible for rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in going to Finland's railway transport.
Stageceach is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter tells it.
Railway transport is to be opened to competition from time to time.
The first is the traffic of the capital city in 2017-2018.
After the traffic, there's a long train.
Souter tells the Ministry of Transport that he's already approached.
According to Ylen, the Ministry of Transport considers the plans of Onnibus to be welcome.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Russia), which has so old bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
In the United States, the Central Bank must make decisions on the highest level
The rest of the world follows the side of the United States when the Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise its peaks for the first time in almost twelve years.
When I asked the 80 economic operators a little more than half of those who still believed in the central bank's peaks last week, they now believe that the situation is not resolved and that the rates are currently 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank broke down the charges at zero, it's seven years.
For the first time, we are in approach, where the central central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising the peak levels," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics, senior co-w.
In the United States, the economy has worked very well, and recovery has brought about billions of dollars and has created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less Russian global views.
It has warned the markets that they must be ready to move, but the signs also show that they believe that the chances are against growth.
This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union at 20 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi the following morning, before her colleague shot her again the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was "failure" from his first murder and hoped, "that he could get it," the authorities told him.
Commissioner Gautier's police said that Delta State University's teacher of land and community data Lamb called a surprise number about ten in the morning
on Monday, and he said he was shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send constables to his home.
He said "his wife's last night" and also mentioned that there's a "big dog" in the house which "does not bother anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller this name, but he didn't tell it.
Lamb didn't give the explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived there, 41-year-old Amy Prentiss found the body and 45-year-old Lambine's order to write a message, which read: "I'm so sorry that I could take it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who has ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb walked about 500 miles [500 km] to Delta State, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself after being arrested by the police during the day.
Dr. William LaForge of the University said that there was no difference between Lambin and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in Lambi's mind."
According to the authorities, despite the statements published by Lamb as a country on the basis of which he believed that the Prentissian was in relation to Schmidt, there was no "more information or evidence" about any kind of "three millionaire".
Shawn O'Steen told me that she was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as "good for humanity."
A couple separated 15 years ago, but he remained a friend.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "skinned."
O'Steen said Prentiss and his daughter were "the best friends in the past."
According to Lindsday Knowles, Prentiss worked all over the network. Sun Herald said he was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lambin for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police told Lambi to call the socialists somewhere on the ground to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police intended to reach Lambi's kingdom at 1:00 a.m. near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped his car on the road, left it there and went to a forest where he shot himself.
Lamb claimed growth data from Delta State in June 2015, telling the university's website about the real estate list.
Marks that lost their fishing force
The displayr (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been a franchise for the last year.
In 2001, he became ill with leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to the reports, he also had brain problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for brain damage.
All of this really requires your tax.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is outside for a couple of months because of a double divorce.
Luke Shaw got double-crossed on his right foot in the ruins of Manchester United PSV to Eindhoven in the pursuit of the Masters too.
Although the defendant remained silent and has been outside for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this way yet.
Vamma was responsible for Héctor Moren's detention at 15 minutes after Shaw was in his 20th year in the PSV area.
She was treated in the field for nine minutes and had to be given a spleen before she was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got double legs and he's in the hospital now."
We'll move him tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then we'll play in Manchester.
This is bad. The boy comes to Manchester United in his 18-year-old, suffers from difficulties and then plays a great game, and now he does.
When I was in the chat room, he had a janitor on his desk.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double circumcision takes at least half a year, and he's not playing at a reading stage.
I hope he'll be able to play this way.
Moreno was happy when he got a red card and a fine.
Specialist Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal proposed that the Italian officer should be released.
You can judge yourself in a situation when I say there's a fine and a red card.
It was a really bad two-way drive.
Shaw said, "Thanks to all of your messages, your words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, I hope to start now, I'll be stronger."

In France, the English defence has an additional invitation to tender for the first time in June.
"It's really bad for you."
If a player gets out of there because of such violence, they're all very sad.
The purpose of the rescuer is never to attack the opponent.
Morenon's leg was broken when he played in a Mexican band against Van Gaalin Holland in 2014 at the MM.
"Moreno takes this seriously, because the purpose is not to hurt the opponent, and when she hears that the cow is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing that looked like a ball that was going in different directions, so it seemed as if he [Moren] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's authority.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how to deal with such a thing.
I feel sorry for myself because of this, I'm so sorry."
Andres Guardado was also diagnosed with Chris Smalling.
When did David Cameron feel better about this?
Every parent learns soon about something: if your child loves something, he will not be long before he learns it almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When a childcare service was asked by the prime minister in his favorite book, he chose Dr. Seussin The Lorax, a 1971 environmental history published.
The choice was a challenge, Cameron writes on the SuperCamps company's website in a message and goes on: "Hush, move, create and contain a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book to my children because it always feels like a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next chapter, where Cameron is likely to describe the book one, is a detailed system of the 2012 film version, which included almost a few new ideas and details in the original text.
"In the city of Tarville inside the walls, where all nature has been destroyed and even without being commercial, Ted-boy hopes to win his dream on the side of the girl's heart by fulfilling the hope of Audrey to see the right tree," says the text and describes a lover who died in 1991 as Dr. Seuss, rightly called Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not enough doubt yet, Cameron's text sounds to the site as if it had been taken from the online Movie Database website of Lorax, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is practical and even without it is commercial, Ted-boy hopes to win his dream on the heart of Audrey's daughter."
Given that Cameron is generally an active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unreputable to the book. There a young man, named son, hears how the local nature has destroyed a weak, fragile tree and needs called Kerskan, without immediate reference to the history of the name of a short, weekend from Loraxi, who speaks of the trees.
This relatively invisible PR text is probably issued to an assistant who has never apparently read a letter to a child 20 times.
The Prime Minister's rapporteur said that the text had come from Cameron's selection office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying on the side of the English team, but it was a tough place.
To play against Pakistan in the Arab Republic is a hard task, but when you see what group England has chosen for the race, I don't believe that the return of the last 3 to 0 series is likely.
I wouldn't close my neighbor's cell phone.
Alastair Cook may have been less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it includes good cruisers, and the group's thinking is strong: they have not had a chance since 2012, but a young positive one.
A lot of Ali is developing in their circuits, and Adil Rashid is an alternative to the attack, even though there are unknown factors at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth tipped out of the British Cricket Group, his position will be Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is clearly to analyse the problem to me because I'm his prime minister in Yorkshire.
His seven games have had good attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh fact is that the cricket players are evaluated on the basis of their results.
For example, Joe Root's choice was no uncertainty before being informed, because, as I said earlier, players are the best choices.
About a hundred minutes more, and Lythin would have been able to continue in the group, but he himself was responsible for his own trial.
Hopefully, if he gets more driving to Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
English Prime Minister Trevor Bayliss went over Lythin's position even when he didn't act as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me.
It's difficult to answer the question of how long it's time to be left behind.
Lyth was selected seven times in the field, like Sam Robson before him, when Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was allowed to play at home and in the neighborhood.
The only cause of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trottt for the first time in the Caribbean when Lyth was at the summit, but it is now a chance of the past.
Alex Hales will come along, and there's some cuts I value.
He's a Greek player who saw us in Yorkshire early this time when he made 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this truth certainly depends on a group meeting in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of the Moenes in the ski resort near Cooke, where there would be more than enough food for the village but there could be four held speeds, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why the cuts could be cut there, and this leftover has already shown that it's a little cricket player.
Many didn't necessarily do their job at Worcestershire, but he's got three of them, and there's no difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first play in the box before he moved to open in 2001.
He just made a third point and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will become a group of thieves, and, as far as I've been with her, she feels very impressed with the young man.
People can see his unpretentious statistics - in the short term the average of 31, with a ball 35 and think it's a threat, but there are not too many eatingers and voters who choose young people.
He learned a lot about this race.
In England outside the group, there seems to be a few strong increases in the preparation period.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan short sword Mahela Jaawarden to consult with the games can be shown as a neuron.
He's one of the best friends of the game, and he's brought with him a great deal of experience because he's done everything in all circumstances and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood will come to the white ball games, and bring in both the energy and the inexhaustible destruction.
I have always thought that he was born in the international crisis, was then playing or preparing, and he has the same useful animals as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the chat room can trigger a group, even if their message is the same as before.
Collyn's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is engaged in one day, Rooti was given the same burden against Australia, and I have no problem with this at all.
Although not everyone agrees, manufacturers and voters do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a simple basis.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can be won if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's partial renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is still facing the biggest problems of the day, even though it would not even take into account Jeremy's heartfelt "Is it right?" Corbyn's choice of the part-party leadership or the ability of the professional associations to reach Europe.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faragens.
The European diplomatic press recently explained that because the EU is so deeply involved in the various crises that not all of them are the reasons why some Member States have been forced into a self-sustained British agenda that is full of grants and disturbing changes to agreements that these countries do not want most.
At the annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organization of Professional Associations decided not to want them even if they are in need of social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfish agent.
The Prime Minister and the Prime Minister will be late for the summits or for the two international meetings held in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves in front of a famous local memorial with or without a local observer, and will then come home to say that they will win support for reforms.
It's all about me.
A European friend who wants to look outside the UK at the EU border - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin - suggests that the shortest ministers and officials in certain cities are now in such a position that they don't care if we leave.
Germany's vigilant and malt-like connector Angela Merkel is a member of the League, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave its role before it goes to the ball as it went too long for the Thatchers (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande has been re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's too weak to have power.
On the other hand, there can be a national legal administration, a left-hand Spanish.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for self-sustained Brits, when their energy would be more determined to prevent them from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to do so because of similar separatism.
So, my friend would point out that some of these ministers can even plan to make some of the comments that are of little benefit to Scotland's national party in the form of an Ison-British national voting campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renewal negotiations had been arranged" and "Renewal negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have had a terrible experience of how the Fleet Street Group can be a part of the EU Sceptical Journal itself, which they were not during the 1975 referendum of Tony Benin, when our membership was confirmed by resolution 2:1 of 1973.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro opportunist, who named himself "from the EU's top bananas" as a writer in Brussels at the beginning of the 90th century.
Ed Milband may have been a hero, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
To them, a group of tax collectors, phone calls from outsiders, and people whose home is on the other side of the street, who own most of our words.
Tony Blair actually thought of them exactly the same, but he realized that if you're in trouble with the gorilla, the bananas must be created for the sake of frustration, unless you want to be on that gorilla lunch list and later on the evening.
In fact, Milband was more blair-like than Blair himself, which is going to be opposed to Cameron's renegotiation negotiations.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly deceived me at the Westminster Parliament Hall on Monday (I told him that he no longer has time to hurt me), would appear to be in danger of taking over the 80-year-olds of Neil Kinnock in the Murdochia strategy, which was wrong and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep contact with the media. Not to me, but to me, of course, Andrew Marriin, who went to the BBC headquarters in Corby on Sunday.
Corbynin's official position in Europe is, as beautiful as it is, developing.
He says that he would like us to continue to reform in the EU.
Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom's own self-esteem of the U.K. military effort and the conservative side of the leading nationalists can certainly be based on this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" said that on both radio and TV this week, when her internal partner would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint Carske John McDonnell as Secretary of State for Security was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70th anniversary of his father’s death on television trying to be unusual for his colleagues at work without going so far as to lose his place of government.
Hillary's surfaces were more attractive.
But for that reason, the struggle to remain together in the "condition where it is good" - the lack of Benin - was not what McDonnell said, nor at all what Corby told the heads and citizens at a private meeting on Monday.
In any case, it is an inexhaustible, emotional and personal picture that Corbyn wants to focus (remember that he even cares about me), that communication is important during a television interview, and especially on social media routes, which are essential to the growth of women and girls.
As McDonnell has said, it is only necessary to give Cameron the air carrier a European permit to support part-time support in the national voting campaign on its own.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, McDonnelly and Corbyn's basic review of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-Hand economy and anti-capital history) is no longer difficult to discuss in a couple of left-wing thinkers whose small differences are central to the study.
As for his two-year-old relationship with Nathan (Tom Watson has assured that Corby's campaign is not to be launched), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to the president.
Why would Paris or Berlin support the granting of political capital (they also have uncertain voters) to Britain when it can be fully marketed?
The United States has already failed to defeat the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the face of cost-effective conservation management, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Customers criticised the public Health England e-pack assessment
Researchers have said that the government’s claim that electricity packages are 95 % less harmful than traditional has been initiated by the meeting of 12 persons involved in the tobacco industry.
The experts who wrote the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to use the public Health England (PHE) evidence in the report on the issue of electricity.
PHE would publish this "virstantappyväs" report in the last month described it as "a suspicious view of evidence".
However, many researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and have referred to contacts between some experts and tobacco industry.
In the last month, the medical journal Lancet published a statement in which the PHE's main decision against the "excessive speedy background" was launched.
Two other researchers in BMJ have wondered whether the claims are "constructed to a stone or a stone."
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, European Public Health Professor Martin McKee, and University of Liverpool, clinical epidemiology professor Simon Capewell, say: "The main principles of cancer are that they should be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the PHE's claim that "the best estimate is about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" is based on a detailed assessment and simulation of the substance.
In fact, it will be one of the 12 souls that developed a multilateral decision-making mechanism (MCDA) to generate their views on diseases linked to various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were clarified to the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which is told by the head of the previous funding for independent research by the British American Tobacco company.
He also supported the BAT's public health authorities in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced that they had received funding from the electricity producer, but not from the money he was given earlier by Philip Morris International, they were increasing.
The selection principles of the panel members are not stated, but the panel is composed of a number of known sponsors, some of whom also claim to be funded under the study.
Others have not been known in their field of expertise in the control of tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE smoking director.
The group's study "providing widely" that there is a lack of "invented evidence on most of the problems of the products and most of the criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say the PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that the electronic package works as a means of burning children or non-smokers" are early.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being of the PHE, says that the allegations presented in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electronics are significantly less harmful than burning."
Half of those burned alive will die because of their dependence.
All evidence points to the relatively small health risks posed by the power station, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public ignorance compared to the relatively dangerous smoke.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year of smoking-related diseases and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds per year.
By explaining the present evidence - even if the electrical packages are not safe - their diseases are just part of the traditional smoking disease - we fulfill our national responsibility.
BBC would like to leave East Enders, says former Channel 4 leader.
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "take anything" from any of the blacks, such as this Albert Square road map.
Johnson said that the commitments should be used only for programmes that other British postal operators do not do.
He criticized BBC's establishment of public service programmes that probably have less generality, the most ambitious programmes for competitors at the time of the contract and for channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC president Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more to cooperate with other organizations, Johnson said he met Channel 4: at the time of six years to create a relationship with BBC, at the cost.
"I don't understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programs that are clearly suitable for non-sustainable competitors," Johnson pointed out to the Committee on Communications in the upper room as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the payment is accepted - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or for a long time - it should at least be a range of production for programs that others do not and do.
The Voice will be sent at the most important time, because it will want to restore as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would look like a program is funny, it's ridiculous, it's obviously a mess.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without State support.
The Voice is one such and the EastEnders is another, unconstitutionally realized inside the room.
In direct terms, the other canals would give anything of it.
I don't understand how this is about sending public service.
I don't think it's going to weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4: in 2004-2010, historian Johnson said that BBC is responsible for forest degradation "because of the objectives of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to get long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series, reflecting the comments of former Sky's leader Tony Ballin, who used his MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that BBC sells series such as East Enders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public service programmes "will go to BBC4, where it is not often possible to measure the level of viewing, but BBC will thus fulfil its responsibility and then, in defense of the 4 billion pounds of loans, it can reasonably say that 'surely, we will do all these unknown programs that no one will see'.
They're putting them in a place where no one will ever see them.
With regard to payment, Johnson said to the Committee: "I would ask you to look for a more aggressive system in which one is most likely to respond to it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that at 150 pounds a year, but I don't know if it's a place for people with 150 pounds of money because they don't use BBC much.
Former Skyn and Channel 5: Director David Elstein, who also proved to the Committee to be a poet, said that BBC should reassess its former role in Reith "to communicate, train and accelerate".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is currently classified as education - he said that there is 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a sample of Australian and Canadian public radios and change the role of "information, selection and speeding".
As for partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts that appear only on television, and connected with commercial companies so that all of them would be on the visible network.
"Agenuity" enables brain-management by means of sound waves
The video shows how the audiences change direction as soon as their voice pulse divides them.
Researchers have grown up with genes that have genetically modified hermorrhage systems so that they can be guided by sound waves.
The tiny dolls change direction as they form a voice-impulsion that is too high to hear human sacrifice.
Impulsions work on genetically modified business streams that react to ultrasounds.
Subject: Researchers read and write on the subject
Researchers said that the muscles indicate the function of a new, sound, method, and that certain brain, heart and body organs can be activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in California, La Jolla, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace the neurostimulation. It is an invasive measure in which people's brains are led by electricity pumps to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The couples don't normally react to the outside, but Chalasi found that when they were surrounded by a nest with a microscopic little hole, the situation changed.
He noticed that the cubes strengthened the ultrasounds that then walked into the clouds.
The established outer regions affect TRP-4 ionic acids, structures that are in some soils.
The speakers will be able to open and activate the key points attached to them, as stated in Nature Communications, published in the report.
In order to produce ultrasounds, Chalasani was genetically composed of eyes, so that part of them are TRP-4-ionic.
When Chalasina used ultrasounds, the micrococks strengthened sound waves and addressed the ground where they connected the modified traffic waves.
The procedure includes some of the same boundaries as optogenetic, innovative tools that give scientists the possibility to link hermos to and remove by using light bulbs.
However, Chalasani says that the use of somnolence can be somewhat beneficial compared to the use of sonogenesis.
Unlike the light that must be sent from the optical to the deep inside the brains long enough, the ultrasounds can pass through the tissue without stopping, so they can be sent to the brains on the neck.
"We believe that the use of gene therapy and therapeutic virus may be possible to target human hermorrhages temporarily to react to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other sites of application may focus on body fats and insulin-producing salts, which he added.

Eight golden rules for the student's life
It's been 11 years since I was an unknown 19-year-old, changed to a student school. Then I believed in barrets and moral relativism, but now I remember people's violent smiles - and heavy, long complaints about others.
Most of my students can be determined by eight simple rules.
Changing the living room can be a completely scary thing to do with any hermes.
It's a pleasure to see you at home, to tell you what you're in the middle of the year and where you think of Corbyni, and why "in fact I don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a haircut HAHAHA finding me in my room".
Take your life.
And help others to breathe, ask questions and show interest.
It will lead the discussion and help you to find the people you love, and not those you don't want to talk to, even if your eyes are coming and they're going to split up.
Give people a place.
People's rooms are often converted into cocktails, ceilings, and general weather spots, but they are also places where people squeez and fix their basics.
On the subject: Don't even imagine starting your university in your marriage
The university is a great place for introverts.
Your room should be a place of comfort, but many of the rooms are made up of a different culture, which is friendly, social, and leads to lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who's trying to relax.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say, "I love you and I want to be your friend, but you have to leave now that I can get back to the energy I spent talking with you."
Try to figure out when the student's room is wrapped up in socialism, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of the door.
When the conversation was over, it's over.
One type of student in my school apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he would have been invited inside.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through dating.
Because you're starting the university on the sidewalk, people's touching the door with a succulent glass, and self-representing something far less strange, less "comes to the neighborhood, I've got something for you, now that I'm asking you about personal questions" -50.
The offer of self-contained vegetables must be an excellent way to develop friendship.
Your roommates will try to be responsible for talking, and they may continue to join you in your growing up to be a bit of a surprise.
This really depends on whether you're gonna be able to do it.
Well, well-encompressed sugarcane drops are likely to get people just to get out of bed when you fall.
The theft of food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking someone's foot off is stealing, but what if you just take a little milk?
Ask and check out the owner of the country.
It's quite possible that they will give you a promise, even if they're laughing inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathies, but try to treat it older than I do, who gathered his petals to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You don't have to pretend that people don't get tired or studying.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like it's going to cover the sand of the word.
The girl I was using asked the neighbor if they could call the drum and bass music later, because the clock was three in the morning and she had a train in the morning.
The response was to increase the voice capacity.
When they ended up late at five in the morning, the girl kindly gave them their sleep two hours before she put her own music to rest, covered her door, and went into a three - hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future partner had a chance to change the same place with you?
Or, in turn, would it not be incredible if you were to have a future partner, you would be together, separated, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends in him.
Of course, my heart wants what you want, but if my roommate is not really your future partner, you can even try to speak with your base.
At the moment you notice that someone has left his or her open room, the border between conversation and temptation is more dangerous than it does.
It's a good game, but it's a good time.
You can give a useful and funny lesson about safety by hiding something, but never touch someone's room with teeth and shampoo.
Open their doors and shut their doors to the waters that you then put in the bag, but don't touch their property on the nether floor above the height of two.
Foreign students' homes of racist uncle Kiteel - The house planned as a reception center was constructed in Salo
The home of foreign students was held on Monday morning in the Chinese district of Kite, North Karjala.
In other words, as the police said earlier, there are no housing arrangements for temporary asylum seekers, but more than ever the pensions of foreign students in Finland, according to Professor Heidi Luukkain of the National University of China.
The windows and walls of the National Holiday Styles were decorated with racist marks, such as those applied for, and one of the guesthouses window was covered with a metal sheet, told the East Finland police.
According to Luukkas, a teacher of the social and social education of young people in the National University, the building was estimated at ten people during the summer.
"It was a weekend and mature people were free to move, so some could be different," Loukain says.
The National Bureau has hosted 12 people from different nationalities.
In Finland, they have been students for some time, as well as temporary asylum seekers who have been contacted.
All the buildings in the war are a-stamps.
Some students in adult education, some in vocational education and some students in Finnish," the Finnish newspaper.
The Statute A has been so stated as to grant a continuing residence permit that can be granted for four years once in Finland to a foreign country.
The East Suomen police were investigating the case as a crime scene and a murder of the house.
According to Luke, the school was held to be a ground-based information facility, where there was also a need for translation.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time when something like this happens," Luukian says.
According to the legend, the match has already been removed from the wall.
There were, of course, at least three men and they had been on the move in a car.
I think this is the theme of the youth weekend when this issue has now been on the surface.
It's nothing more serious," Loukain says.
A hospital has also been cleaned in Salo, which is covered by the reception centre.
The murder happened last week.
The issue was reported on the MTV website on paper.
The hospital wall was bordered by a searcher and written by his English "You are not welcome".
It's a crime report to the police.
Amendment 15.9. 16.02 Corrected police administrations for misinformation about the age and status of the people in the building.
The government will stop Y-yunna Karjaal - tourists near, "Idiottics of the world"
The Y-juna going to Karjaal from Helsinki will stop walking in March.
The news drew attention to the starting point of that June by means of the Helsinki capital investigation.
In particular, the bottom line is on the sandy ground, says Torbjörn Bengtström, a town in the state.
Idiots, because the number of people who live and work is growing all the time and need a fast and flexible relationship with Helsinki.
This can't be anything else than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström tells HSTV's interview video even if it comes to the capital of the tractor.
There are also other incidents in New Zealand.
The H- and R-units will be reunited as R-line.
The position of the syringe in Järvenpääs and Nuppulna Tuusula will be withdrawn from use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Communications and the VR have published, as a paper, information on which the Ministry of Transport purchases a joint transport under the following contract.
The scope of the contract is changed in the year-by-year period, and the routes to be stopped are throughout the country.
A new four-year agreement will be adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström considers that the State party is short-lived.
We will make the same mistakes as we did before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there's a fall on the ground.
Y-turns also use other than rasesporians and censors, because it's fast and closes many positions.
From the Espoon Anna Pöyry, on June, the city area was affected by the longer term of travel.
"It's a bad name for those who have to plan their trip again," he said, putting it in Y-Y-Y.
It's a little easier.
There is a new link to the railway station, which replaces the Y-Jun in the Helsingin Seudung (HSL) region, i.e. to the Church number.
This will increase the costs for HSL, which is, in practice, for the citizens of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now able to identify different options and their impact on service and ticket prices," HSL deliverer Suvi Rihtniemi said.
Costs cannot yet be assessed properly.
The Board of Directors says that the HSL based on the number of passengers has paid out of the Y-turn for a million years, much more than that.
The next R line is to leave between two positions.
Instead, the number of unions in Ainolas and Saunacal is doubled.
All over the country, 28 small positions and numerous routes are left together.
The Ministry no longer buys a joint transport from the cars of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensu-Rīti will be reduced to the region of Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
The railways are reduced by the cars of Rihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, the port of Kouvola-Katka and the Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year will be made in the months to be stopped when the total purchase of travel by the ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixth Korkman wrote in the book The Master's Journal: "Marx's Support for Family"
The world's economic crises have risen to the top of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and in 1867-1894, published in his final edition of Pejaman, writes in a book published today by Yrjö Hakan in the journal Marxin Päoman.
"They are now taken more seriously than for a long time," writes Hakan in his speech.
Marx's assessments of the development, internationalisation and deepening of the capital economy to all living areas, focusing on capital, as well as the growing role of capital and mental capital have been shown to be an amazingly remote region.
The author of the book based on the Master Seminars is also found by Professor of the Aalto University, a valued economic manager, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is a contemporary "now and forever".
However, is not the former Director of the Institute of Research and of the Government of Elkeine Life a Marxian?
Not really.
Korkman, in his phone call, says that he does not consider Marx to be a temporary economic worker but rather a more interesting community theory.
Social data have been specialized and specialized today, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and editor of literature.
"The usual thing is that history tells about the wrong attitudes of dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's prophecies went very slowly.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial coup, he drew far too close conclusions from the capitalist beginning.
But Korkman sees value in the radicalization of Marx.
"The most relevant thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing the aspects of Marxin's entertainment, such as the sharing of privacy.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a great picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical imagination," Korkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is no help from Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only end.
But Marx is supporting Korkman's idea of a family.
"In '70s Marxa couldn't read," Korkman says.
"Maolas and trotscals and others hated all capitalism, but still more to others."
Today's debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also come closer without the age of ideology and political stress.
"Every social worker should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
UN requires military courts to judge Sri Lanka
The UN requires the establishment of a Special Court of Justice to investigate the armed conflicts in Sri Lanka, reports the AFP.
The United Nations report on the use of the internal market for 1983-2009 was published in the medium term after a long period of time.
The report blames the military forces, the Sri Lankan army and the military forces known as the Tamil army.
In Sri Lanka, at least 100,000 people are estimated dead.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the large number of armed forces should be investigated in the last months of the war, as required by the UN report.
Sri Lanka’s troops reported charges of rape, rape, and systematic sexual violence, which were probably the same as men and women.
According to the report, the Captains have been charged with physical and child rape as combatants.
Both parties have been charged with the murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it was going to organize the investigation itself, but it is not going to be the case for the United Nations Court of Justice, because foreign judges.
In English y-coke, socialist media can be targeted
In the Scriptures, the cross - references of the Sikhs included a long, English - speaking language in the central part of the empire.
The English sciences tested more than 16,000 cocals.
In the trial, the substance could be written on social media.
Based on my own experience, I wondered if social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
The English version of 150-250 could possibly refer to the Internet’s most popular viewer.
The search was Dear Agony Anunt.
Agony Anut answers from the Finnish Leelian beauty.
He was asked how the parents should see things about young people as well.
Together, the subjects of the substance were four, one of which was to be selected.
"It was hard for them," considered the third theme of Porvoo's Swedish-language reading, by English-reader Mia Lybeck.
In the third case, only the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barrosol, had been appointed.
The fourth thing was very nice for Lybeck again.
It had to write a statement about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we're used to writing wood," Lybeck says and assessed the whole experience "as normal".
In the English trial, for example, questions were raised about the adaptation of summer camp to climate change and the treatment of large unknowns.
The average week was also written by some Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
Syksy’s writings continue as a family, where there is a second household, either a meal or a Finnish examination.
In Luke’s account, trials are usually arranged, or the attitude of employees is not affected by them.
The University of the University of Applied Sciences calls on students to seek suitable travel in time so that they can pass on to the test.
Additional time can also be obtained if it can show that delay did not result from its own indifference.
In the village, the trade was stolen by a gun
In the village, they were robbed on Wednesday morning of trade in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the thief had been dragged into dark clothes and raised to hide in the command line.
A man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff and received a small amount of money.
Let's look into the matter as a bunch of thefts.
Police are committed to reaching ten-year-old volunteers in Helsinki - support parties elsewhere from Finland
The opinion of the Board of Appeals in response to the rulings of the Government will be supported by the central family of Helsinki, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, there may be even tens of thousands of people in the area.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTTK associations will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the opinion.
In addition to providing alerts and other police activities, the duty of the police in the workplace is to ensure that the waste is disposed of.
The roads leading to the railways are closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9.30-14 hours.
Only alerts are delivered to the area.
The journey from the direction of Hakanei to the direction of the river from the direction of the Mannerheim from the point of view of the river from the point of view of the sea.
Is there enough people in Helsinki's police station, Colonel Seppo Kujala?
Second, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand for the police's jobs.
According to the Helsinki Summit, for the sake of the opinion, support parties other than Finland have come from Finland.
I don't want to tell the police about any significant party numbers.
"Some of the blood's coming, but we're usually going to do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are urging us to avoid a private device in central Helsinki.
The figure estimates that the bad traffic contract is being carried out at Hakanie's level at the nuclear center.
A steady movement is expected from the beginning of the morning.
On the other hand, there are a lot of bus buses in Helsinki, thanks to the volunteers who arrive from Finland.
They're not going to be delivered to the Routati Center.
The buses will be on their way.
Then you're going to have to go to a place of thought," Kujala tells you.
The state of mind will also stop the Helsing mission.
From the police point of view, there's a positive side here.
The question of mobility of railways, which is normally addressed at these large gatherings, is now being addressed in part by itself.
The organizers of the opinion have informed the police that Helsinki may be the economic policy opponents of the ten thousand Government.
The police expect peace of mind.
Maybe they're normal employees or unemployed people.
The Finnishs are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
In different parts of Finland, local opinions are also organized as a family.
In many ways, the thought of the past is exceptional. Do you remember these laws and opinions?
In many ways, a great deal of thinking is interesting and exceptional.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskyl.
You don't have to be surprised that ay-game protest.
If it hadn't, it would have raised its hands in front of the government, Sisiengen would have said.
The very legitimate government has taken over the traditional aspects of Finnish corporateism - as well as those that have been important for the development of the Finnish good government.
The hard-of-the-government authorities are not entitled to contract.
There are a lot of limits to the fact that ay-games are really trying to get a gun.
The same is true of the ay movement. There's a place to look at the mirror.
The game, for example, is needed to ensure that the ay movement does not in any way have the support of all employers in the past for the countries of thought.
The new is now the division of the church, which the state of mind will have time for a group whose ay-mist would want to participate in the opinion.
The unemployment rate in Finland was estimated to be higher than in November 1993 at the national level.
If I looked for a comparison point for the country of thought, it could be the unemployment allowance, Murrostorsta, a 1993 statement.
In the middle of a heart attack organized by Murrostorsta, a total of 20,000 workers were employed.
Esko Aho (center) government corrupts labour market crises on the other side.
It was said that Finland's government and employers' organizations had never been as bad as Aho's tax administration.
Now the government's and ay's movements may be even worse than Murrostor's times.
In addition, there is now a very serious vacuum management in Finland, Sisiengenen says.
The current Government College is still interested in the fact that it is such a strong legal basis despite the basics.
There were some elements of the old trade movement in the winter.
The place is expected to be surrounded by thousands of fans.
The state of mind also stops public transport and possibly closes daily homes and schools.
Even if the pensioner’s income is not shared by the employees, it can result in a greater number of years.
In Helsinki, there have been some 300 opinions for the last year.
They're on board.
Traditionally, in the Finnish ay movement, the ideals have been very peaceful, although they have been in action for the past few years.
Traditionally, in Finnish opinion, conflict is avoided, being legal.
The thinkers are trying to avoid the damage or destruction of property, Sisien's word.
By the end of the 1990s, however, new winds were brought.
The culture of thinking changed.
The EU membership led farmers to throw their cornmelons out and the police managed to get on top of it.
In 1998, the Palomies left for three months.
The figures show also included aircraft and pilots.
Do you remember these laws and opinions?
Metals and electronics of the 1970s
The most significant lakes in the 1970s were metal lakes in 1971 and power and electricity in 1977.
A total of 70,000 metals were involved in the production of metals.
The Law was suspended by seven weeks during the presentation of the Soviet Union.
The metals received a 16 per cent wage increase.
In March 1977, the electrical power plant lasted 49 days and caused electric currents around the country.
Murrostorstai 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to show their appreciation for work.
Palomen were living in three months in 1998
The palace was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless I was a national building.
Vulnerables against the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were protesting farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU stops," said one of the schools.
In Spain, farmers had to cut down tonne.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also enabled farmers to protest and burn the Jews in front of the meeting place.
The caregivers settled 1983 and 1995
The hospital staff lived for about a month in 1995.
Last time they were married in 1983.
In 1995, a number of cases of deaths occurred during the construction period.
In 2007, I threatened to strike and arrest the guards.
The threat of mobilisation was finally triggered by the negotiations.
Doctors lactating 2001
"The Doctors of Law - the Challenge," said in 2001 the School of Doctors of Lawyers.
The number of public health centres and hospitals lasted five months, and it was time to discuss how the courts could threaten the safety of the patient.
After the act, the public sector has paid the doctors' wages.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students from the Helsinki Senate in 2013 for the March Study.
The Central Police will find the refugees fully aware of the Finnish Republic's conflicts with the Italian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Police to help in resolving the floods in the Finnish Register.
On Sunday, the Italian police stopped at Aisterheim near Germany’s border with 42 refugees.
The file does not contain a list of possible routes to Finland.
Everything was good for you at the end of the line.
We've had an exchange of information with the Italian police.
The survey and the head office is in an event area in Eastern Italy, tells Major of Central Policy Tero Haapala.
By the end of August, the rest of the East German truck had become more and more vulnerable to passengers.
By the end of the day, all 71 passengers who had been in attendance were apparently killed in support.
In cooperation with the Italian police, according to the first report of the General Assembly, the race belongs to the Finnish department.
The company is operating, inter alia, a food industry, and its provider is an outsider, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Hungry Captain, former drug dealer and former businessman - the story of the five conquistadores
A king of secretaries, a violent Russian, a typical messenger, and a very good to keep a taxi.
For example, such persons are subject to human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trent, and the supplier Giampaolo Musumec, have met and interviewed ten secretaries and their "owners" and, by writing their book, the Death Travel Office will express its opinion this week.
In the book, they present the man-made products, make solutions, and present secretaries from the various ports of the business.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The church files in Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there to a central location.
The islands are also particularly suitable for transport, since only 120 km from the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is a trip to the island of Lampedusa.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki is about 85 km from Tallinn.
There, on El Attaya's roof, is Emir, my captain is burning in the kitchen and my father's six children.
Crekenna-shalts are famous for their shells, but the fisherman is more productive to drive people.
Emir's done it in blue, 10-metres of wood, hundreds of stories already.
If the Russian seal is full, it's possible for 40 people.
On one trip, Emir spends some 8 000 euros after costs.
Emirl has five supporters who are looking for her clients around Tunisia.
Customers have come from many countries, but during the Arab era, a large number of Tunisians wanted to put on an airway.
After that, the situation was calmed until the refugee crisis came to an end.
Customers get from Manter to Kerkena in small groups.
Emir rents them to empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers just stay alive.
The rent will pay about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer closes the money, it is their problem.
We're going to the water in the middle of a short walk.
The first night is taken away from the island, then stopped, waiting for the day and waiting for the next night for Lampedus.
Sometimes it's hard to catch, and passengers in 20 meters high below the ground will wake up and wake up.
The human body has been detached in an hour and Emir is leaving for the rest of the world.
Emir wants him to be scared.
As a result, she complains about her client and at least complains that she's a fan of ghosts.
He says in the book that when the police chased him, he threw all his passengers across the boat and ordered these birds to be on the nearest island.
"I tried customers individually and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The quietest travelers will come from south of Sahara.
He's got to listen to his landman about this.
Let's get them out of here right away.
They need to know who's counting here right now.
The usual taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary Turkish in the Bogovadas of Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good. It's a start-up engine running last time, and of course it's seen the best day of it.
However, it is important for Goran customers to move over the taxi and to move towards the borders of Hungary.
Bogovavata is a small town about 500 miles [60 km] from Belgrade on the west coast.
The centre for asylum seekers is located next door, mainly in the family.
In the middle of the surrounding forest without family members, men travel to live in tents, in large and abandoned cars, now that everyone has been able to find or build.
There are also families in the village who have not left their asylum application in Serbia for reasons or for others.
Some also rent private property, but it's a public secret.
Goran's team will find most of their customers.
These are often overcrowded - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weekly journeys in a difficult landscape, often in coastal areas and in the dark.
When we finally reach the Bogovád region, the great point of human civilization, people are dying.
Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis, and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he's telling in the book.
"They say their thing once and it's enough," Goran complains.
He says the Africans are trying hard.
Goran doesn't like it.
The hall heard the whole trip.
For example, the price of EUR 300 is agreed first, then they count it to 200, and they offer it at the end of 150.
Goran highlights her beauty and approval of a man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells him to do his job less than others and to pay for his request to the Hungarian border of only EUR 50.
The trip is three hundred miles [3 km], most of which is comfortable with motor vehicles.
The colleagues will ask for a third or fourth price.
Goran owes about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a large amount for the consignor, but it's a very nice anniversary in Serbia.
Serbia has determined that the taxis cannot move to a transferable distance of 12 kilometers closer to the border of Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he's aware of the roads and the trains, and he's got a mile from the border.
Then he shows the customers the right direction and throws them away.
In the work of the board
From 35 years of age, a Congolese is called a Messenger, and it is not just a favorite name.
In fact, he has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where many of Congo’s prisoners of faith are being put on hold, as well as a small center where the Congolese children are being helped.
In addition to the mission, the Ambassador will turn on a secret transport bus that will move people from Congo to Europe.
He's looking for a job to do.
It's important for the transmitter to look good.
He has many times a day, and I am worried that the white cataracts of the cucumbers will slowly scurried through the thickening of the snouts.
The transmitter is proud of his new Mercedes, his farming car, and his three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and ahead of Europe.
The person will call at the start of any of the five telephone numbers of the senders.
He suggests that the border should be maintained in the morning, keep the money clearly hidden and close the border to the dealers on the way to the border.
In order to obtain a asylum seeker or a refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be informed that there is a home for example in North Kivun war areas and that there has been a need to reduce domestic violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Publisher will arrange a new identity for the client.
Old personality certificates will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
That's where they help the Ambassador's contacts in Ugandan police.
Thereafter, the customer is guided to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum application, the creation of civil organisations, finally the UN refugee organization at UNHCR.
The sender feels bureaucracy because he has come to Uganda as a refugee.
It pays for each step separately: leaving an application to the Ugandan police will pay about a hundred euros, treating documents to the humanitarian organization about 150 and changing the process, for example, to a European country of EUR 4,500-7 000.
Follies and ice creams
Tom's the starter of the secret driver, the former junkie.
A four-year-old Irish daily on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to let people go to the streets on the way to Britain.
He has a young Afghan, French taxi driver and ten trainers who do not even know that he is in the passenger bus.
At night, Tom and the cabman arrived at their client, usually from 2-3 people, some of which were sent from Calais.
They're driving A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop by the car, Tom and the driver would have to arrange for an illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it. He's been sitting for seven years because of the noises.
To stop it, Tom is driving the customer's motor over to a quiet place where some people sleep before they continue to leave the canal to Brittany.
Tom's choosing a suitable race - he must make sure that it's on his way to England and not even to the Netherlands, and he's gonna take off the security guard.
It's gotta be quiet so you can wake up.
Sometimes something's in there, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom turns his client on aluminium foil, the same as that which is drawn in the kitchen around the floor or on the floor.
It should prevent the police from detecting the hideouts.
Some use the same amount of salt for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client on the street and leaves the place hope that no one will stop the suspects at least before Britain.
King of the Salaculators
Muammer Little is one of the world's most famous human artists.
The Turkish people from Cyprus have been called the master of the market and the king of the illegal immigration of the Netherlands, which governs the maritime flows from Turkey to the EU, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, the small has been operating and has continuously developed new secretive methods.
He also has a competitive view of other entrepreneurs: he demands money at home.
One of the new methods is the literacy rate: Turkey's hundreds of tourists are taken to the United States or European families for a few days.
In fact, ships are directly loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transporting EUR 5 000-7 000 against payment from the first Istanbul country to port and from there to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stocks, for example in old industrial offices, until they are gone.
People are locked in minibuses, and they're going somewhere on the beach.
They are ordered secretly in a group of growth and are expected to be marked.
When it is given, it must be lifted fast.
Travellers must stop the entire trip under cover.
The Navy can only look at how deep the ship is, because other signs of the human race are invisible.
Food and drink will be provided, but the less visitors grow and grow, the better.
The small will receive about EUR 53 000 from one of the free-of-charge costs.
He does not care for practical things himself but pays the captain, the colours, the guards, the landlords, and other minors to handle the work on his behalf.
There are at least hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of millions of traffic in the south.
It is estimated that through secret companies, the country, the medical company, and over a hundred homes that she rents.
Muammer Kücük was held in 2011 at the same time as the representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and a medical partner.
After that, he's apparently gone.
16.9.2015 at 15.10 a.m.: The death of the travel agency will appear here, not in the first week.
American Olympics tell their book about their disease and their departure as a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, a 500 - foot - long [150 m] jockey Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has raised its attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton is writing on the name of Fast Girl about ending her urine and thinking of being a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated page would publish a series of letters from the book.
Favor Hamilton decided his career in Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the kisses at the funeral and to drink at the casinos for the second time.
But in the finals, he went into panic.
He immediately broke into the corner and broke his lead on the ground.
However, 150 meters before the mine, his power disappeared.
He fell on the edge of the row, and other competitors stopped him after each other.
I felt like I was an idiot, and I thought I'd never walk again.
But I threw myself over the painting, and Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a two-hundred male cancer.
His brother Dan had committed suicide years before Sydney had committed suicide, and he himself experienced great success.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when he ran away as a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The Parisian society had no economic problems, but she was reluctant to get money from having sex with other men.
She also spoke to her husband to approve of her actions.
Favor Hamilton's tax was 450 euros per hour.
He's telling me he's using the money to make a living.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s career as a prostitute was that he was like the same adrenaline stores as he had received in a competition in a public hospital.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had two hundred men.
The two of the first highlights appeared at the end of 2012 when Smocking Gun was published in his article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1,500 feet [3,57,40 m] in the world statistics, but he remained in the Olympics in Sydney.
When I joined the Norwegian Air Force, you said, "Suroralemans"
King Petter Northug of Norway has exceeded the scope of at least one of his colleagues' opinions.
Northug and Norway's hieroglyphics have been calling for the last year's time and effort in the field of sports.
Although the association has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been announced to the world's leaders and the Olympics.
As a result of the Treaty, the Norwegian hieroglyphics decided to close Northug's future world Cup.
The decision was thanked by two world champions Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy to join me in the hijacking.
"Thank you for showing me a little light," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We can't afford to sell that one activist can avoid working for the Union sponsor," he continued.
There is a financial gap between the Norwegian hieroglycities and Northugs.
Northug would obviously want to be a part of the country team so that he could report his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said that he was happy when he represented an association that also cared for future generations, and did not give one of the players in the games.
At the same time, he recalled that the association has given Northug both economic and other special rights for many years.
I know it because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one player has a very different set of rules than just because it's the best one.
Northug would publish his own report, which assured him that he wanted to play in Norway’s colors first across the globe and then in MM-kissies and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won all six MM missions, two of them gold.
He was with him in the last winter of Falun in the winning team.
The day of the contest for the refugees is also held in Northern Ireland
On Thursday 25.9, the events will be organized in various restaurants and shops for which the competition for passengers is granted.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high level of the Finnish food sector and lower the level of departure from the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the cold as a high quality.
It is also to be recalled that not all high-quality restaurants have been focused on the capital city, but the checks and classifications of the independent operator are found around Finland.
The international attention to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of competition companies and organisations.
In the northern part of the country, there will be a restaurant in Vaasa in the Fund and in the Cantarlic.
The day of the contest at Kokkokola is part of a restaurant in Vanhan City.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has also been decided to make one of the most important international events organized by the organization during the same day across the world.
Finland continues to be a country of origin.
Letter of appeal: The establishment of an emergency response centre to legal tenders
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are currently owned by the LSK Business Park Oy, in cooperation with the local refugee response centres.
According to the claim, there is still a critical infrastructure for the crisisr, which is the defence forces and its partner partner, Finland's Erillsverkot Oy.
The complainant's letter says that the establishment of the response centre would constitute a significant safety risk, which is not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the Chancellor, the defence forces may have the interests associated with the former Air Force School and the airport, which have not yet been identified in the preparation of the response centre.
The report states that negotiations have been held for the past two years with regard to the rural area and the result of the possible flight to the airport by an external operator.
The issue has been discussed, inter alia, by Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistung (ps.) and national administrator of the Ministry of Defence with Arto Rädy.
A private entity shall ensure that there is no question of the principle of response to the reception centre but that the planned location in the previous area of supply is wrong.
In the last few days, the city administration has dealt with the response centres.
Nationality: The Syrian situation is due to Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Government means that there are necessary conditions for farmers and those in this area, as the rapporteurs of all the representatives of the Republic of Montenegro have been formally welcomed by the representatives of the Republic of Montenegro.
According to the President, all participants were concerned about the management of the refugee population.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland have been able to discuss the fundamental issues confidently.
Especially in this time when we have great problems ahead of us.
According to the report, the situation in Syria as well as in Russia and the United States can also have an impact on Ukraine and beyond the situation in the Baltic.
It is effective in the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it has an impact on the situation of Ukraine and continues to be a threat to the Baltic Sea situation.
According to the report, the Nato issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.
Finnair spent 16 years on a private plane, Alkot stayed for a couple of hours
One flight is already being started as a tortoise and 15 tours.
A list of flights from Finnair's website is available.
In Finland, it is said that the operations of airports are aimed at maintaining a dominant position during the labour market.
However, suicides and delays are expected for security checks and other services.
The message of hope closes the minds of Helsinki
As a family, the consent of the family will close the central castles of Helsinki.
The police tell the railway station to shut down the cars at 9.30 a.m.-14.
Cars are not rescued from the design of manners, postal and labour-related railways.
The Union's transport plan for Hakanian will be directed to the Union's Roadmap in the direction of the Kaisani railway.
According to the police, the time of closure depends on the number of violence involved.
Only warning vehicles will be delivered to the area.
Metro- and radical regions throughout the country of thought
Metro and railway transporters participate throughout the period from the start of the night service to the end of the night.
The association of railway and metro personnel reported on this matter to the STT on the night of the night.
The Kingdom of Alko is closed for two hours, including the post closures
The prevailing spirit of the world also causes disturbances in the postal services.
Significant delays are expected, inter alia, for day-to-day distribution.
Some of the mail services have been closed.
The blood transfusions of the Finnish Red Cross are treated without charge.
It is also intended to treat atriums, hospitals and laboratory services.
The status information for the services will be obtained from the Posts website.
Most of Finland's Alkoa closes its doors for two hours as a family.
The Pamp Service Professional Association has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11:13 and 13:00.
Pam has also invited day-to-day trade workers to participate in the opinion of professional organisations.
The representatives of the SOK and of the Central Bank are telling Helsinki that the sellers are trying to keep open when necessary.
According to the Commission, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual goods.
The Helsinki daily house is partially closed
Helsing's day houses do not operate as a whole throughout the year, informs the Helsing Bureau of Ageing.
Due to the opinion of professional organisations, day care may be focused on certain days and not on the organisation of day-to-day and recreational activities.
Environmental surveys of day-to-day and developmental and multi-child groups remain open.
In addition, the evening work of the developing and academia schools is organised normally.
The Agency shall allow information on the changes in operations to be made tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Stop taking a real risk
According to Sipila, there is a need for multiple channels, and the Prime Minister's TV and radio talks are one of the channels in other groups.
We also need to continue the canal of this kind of honest speech.
This won't be the last time, Sipila told the suppliers in the community.
Sip still did not want to assess how often the return of the Prime Minister's TV and radio talks are coming.
According to the sip, there is no need to keep your conversations on the Ylen Canal.
If other channels are reported to be canava, they'll be seen then.
Now we're using this canal tonight, Sipila said.
According to Sipler, the state of the economy in Finland is so serious that it requires citizens to be kept on television and radio.
This matter, which is now discussed, is a time of diversity and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel.
The call will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
Stop taking a real risk.
The media researcher hopes that Cyprus will not tell you more about turning into the government.
Is it an attempt to adopt the definition of the public debate more clearly in its own hands and to reject the issues of the public debate? Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
I would like to point out that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) has made a late comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not give it a definition of himself.
I hope, on behalf of the democratic debate and the public, that these matters will not relate to each other.
I understand that the commercial media has been attracted to the Sip’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media hadn't responded.
The political decision-makers' communications requirements are not a matter of democracy.
The role of media representatives is definitely an attempt to avoid the adoption of political agendas.
According to the experience, the TV conversation is a big risk to Sipilje.
In our speech, we should bring something new and special in order to meet the extraordinary high expectations set out in the speaker.
Are we offering today more than we've heard?
Or can he speak in a different way, in a different way, or in a different way, or say something new?
I would like to say that if there is only one more age in the list, I must wonder why such a great victory was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In general, this risk will be taken into account if there is no special situation but routine talk in other groups.
The danger is that the Supreme is bound by communications from politicians or society and government, which is certainly not in line with the interests of the Ylen or the general line.
A silhouette glass glass
It is also important in the future in the future that what the Prime Minister has to say should be stressed by the media researcher.
In the morning, we will see exactly what Sip is missing and what isn't, says Dr. Heikki Kuuttti, director of the University of Jyväskyl.
I heard a TV talk is coming from the village of Sipil, because this is how it gets to the point of its own view without a series of events.
Such a message is received by a large audience without a journalist's consent, other than in the media, where suppliers can pose critical questions.
The sword will stop the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media will translate the language into something wrong, because the correct questions cannot be raised.
I've heard that it's very important how the Sip is on TV, the pain of the wound, the release of the hands.
He's going to be a Sipilian, who's telling the people what to do.
If Sip is able to make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government would know something about it, because this person's age is like talking directly to another person.
Such (United States President Barack) Obama and the partners are regularly celebrating.
Really exceptional
Politician researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to citizens to be very exceptional.
He said it hasn't happened in ten years that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the nation.
An exceptional time requires exceptional ways, Railo says.
The investigator believes that the Prime Minister would like to make the Finnish citizens welcome.
Retirement organisations are organized on a regular basis against the activities of the government.
In Twitter, President of the left-hand side, Mr Arrhimäki says that Sipila could keep her speech on the status of the nation in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, who would also be able to discuss the speech.
SDP President Antti Rinne (Sd.) also announces his concern about the Siplia dialogue.
There's no time for monologues right now.
I've been in trouble for a little half a year.
The finals can't be hidden, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy with a necktie has been found in Tampere.
The boy was right at the time of his discovery.
A boy, one of his friends and friends, his father updated his Facebook page.
The Central Finland police station will also confirm the matter for the night.
The boy went out for four hours at night.
Later tonight, she's lost contact with him.
My father thanks all the people who are looking for him.
Thank you for the ten contacts and discovery during these hours.
The update was distributed almost 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC hits young people into violence: You get angry
A Kurdish liberator, Makwan Amirkhan, would publish a video on Facebook, which is especially encouraging to young immigrants.
Makwan America was under pressure to speak against the young people's attacks.
Amerkhani, born in Iran and with his family in Finland at the age of five, has won both of his professions in the most valuable UFC series of free trades.
Amirkhani tells me that he received a message asking to see one of the Instagrams.
There are videos on the table where young people are killed by extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's a little confused about young people's vulnerabilities.
The 26-year-old American has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The rest of the country, sitting on the other side of the street, sitting face-to-face without thinking about any of the consequences of this, when you do certain videos, American days.
Hard to deal with.
Some of the young people seen in the video are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, social media has loaded video on social media, as well as on immigrants and young people living in refugee camps.
I'll call it that you're killing your superiors by the way.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish American remembers.
I remember that in Finland there are websites that are looking for the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very common.
It's a little hard, boys. Let's talk about you guys.
You should remember that you're still on your way to the country, and you're gonna be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, American says.
Amirkhan invites young people to remember their neighbors.
If they sometimes get into trouble with someone more racially, then you can blame yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, you'll stay.
Amirkhan says violent action is contributing to racism.
You're gonna get a bit of a hate I don't like myself.
You have, of course, bad times, and that's why you're not going to get any better, I'm going to decide.
SAK put its position in the storage package - Lyly: decisions on land
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, tells Twitter that the employer's organization is based on its country's position to submit an alternative inventory.
Lauri Lyly commented on the proposal made by STTTK on Twitter.
STTK told the government that it had made its own proposal last Wednesday, in which Prime Minister Juha Sipil (meaning) would reach five per cent of the period of productivity.
Akava's president, Sture Fäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it required that the largest employers' organization SAK be strengthened in its previous position.
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, made a comment on this issue on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK's work committee is dealing with this matter as a country.
According to Lylyn, SAK sought solutions to "opening the labour market" and that the replacement of requests would require contracts made by active parties.
Lyly recalls that the proposal by the Prime Minister of the Government of Cyprus as a Community agreement did not apply to SAK.
The previous negotiations on the Community agreement would be closed when SAK did not agree to commit itself to the objective of the five per cent productivity class.
Comment: The big message is threatening to come up - "I feel it's a little bit tired to keep the wood dry"
It feels a little bit like a wooden tree, if there's already a toilet paper, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary from position to position in the employer's office.
Does it mean to call a government on a team or even agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's allies cleansed the area of hatred against the government.
All of Finland was threatened.
This publication is not for sale.
The Teachers' Professional Organization, OAJ, threatened to shut down schools and day-to-day homes.
As a smoker, OAJ retired: no school or daily home is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the STTK's chairman, Antti Palola (sd), presented itself in agreement.
She told her Government that she had been contacted and that she had created Prime Minister Juha Sipilė (meaning) to ask for five per cent of the options presented for the period of productivity.
Akakava's president, Sture Fäder (kok), hurriedly announced that his agreement was ready.
The SAK's office did not begin to be covered.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) is difficult to deal with when the federal presidents ordered us to stay on the ground as a family.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's Employment Committee will meet on the first day of the month to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions to "open the labour market".
In order to create a common representation of employers, the SAK should also adopt a five-percent period of productivity objective.
It is no wonder that Palola STTTK has a good relationship with the Government of Cyprus.
Mr Juka Ihanus, Head of Social Action of the STTK, has previously acted as the Special Representative of Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinie.
It is also true that the government's ay-sharing has improved all the time.
Whether or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean away from Finland's residents, whose music played against Akt's Marko Piraiinen (sd).
It's a little bit of a mess, if it's already in the bag with the consent paper.
Modified at 18:00: Add information about Lylyn comments.
The Russians cried Finland's worst father: "This can't be repeated"
Russian Duum President Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki Etyj meeting.
In the opinion of Russian Duum President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Estonia than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun the hearing of the Etyin Parliamentary Assembly, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Jewish meeting.
At the time, Finland did not allow the Russian policies of the European Union's candidate, such as Naryshkin, to be reached at a meeting - a matter which the President was discussing to remind the suppliers.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the press office with Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the Naryshkin’s criticism was addressed to the United States, where it had also been banned.
The sanctions are political suicides from the EU, Naryshkin's newspaper.
The delegation of Mongolia of Russia came to the fore, so Naryshki continued to extend Finland's migration by accommodating and thanking Mongolia for its "aeronautical organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will be a constructive and positive outcome, but rather than a meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolia's leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue does not have to be prevented.
Naryshkin has met with the Ulan Bator meeting, led by Ilkka Kanervan (kok), who has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
Closes the real playoff game: "Malitas in the dark"
The Tappara and Luke continue today in Hakamet, when both will be on the second day of the rebirth.
Janne Lahti predicted that today there will not be any old land management in Hakamet.
Tappara went to Kuopios last night to the 3-2-year-old KalPas.
The rose was a man, for the last time the chopper group was at least two days away from the killing site.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
The Romanian island of the island of Blues, which began suddenly, was surrounded by zero points, and the killings were 2-3 years old.
A tough game, the ground in the dark, if any play the same game as last year, the Lukko-rektor Janne Lahti predicts setups on pages.
The killer has been designed for peaceful little playoff pressure.
The Tappara is named in two previous ways just in the middle of Luko's finery.
In both cases, the solution has been required for seven solutions.
In the last distance, Luke takes the row to the top of the row in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three steps and finished.
There are no major changes in the groups' meetings, except for the number of groups.
The killers who fought both of them yesterday will be killed today.
At the battleground, Mika Noronen makes a place for Tom Karhuss, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: This is a hard display to start.
President Toivola wrote a letter to the chief executive of the Rautakaloli, who was unable to continue, by Santtu Silvennoine Tampere.
It's classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film, where he himself showed his head.
The mayor sensibly put the camps to Apollo Creed's master of the world.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost the title class.
Three and a half years after Rocky's first daughter, Mika Toivola, wrote her hand-held truck to Pori.
The name-and-frequency package led me to surprise all SM finals in 2006.
The group was full of names such as Rocky, but it's a bunch of bad guys.
It was from the White Indians, Porn Mattia and Pele.
The players in the boxing game were coloring their head red and playing the puzzles.
I'd like to be a blond.
The manio TV player JP Jalo called the manufacturer Neamani.
These guys took a winning hope.
The hope was one of the saints.
The author, Mr Toivola, believes that the reform process will work the same way ten years ago.
The man who works as a performer of these sports events has built a house for bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have gone away like Rocky's son-in-law.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparesen's debts are somewhere else than in classical play.
The hope has been forgotten that Rocky VI is the head of Pekka Routakallio.
Karri Kavi has been criticised by Routkallion Sean Connery.
Routakallio is one of the most famous representatives in the Rockys, which Connery would have been at the beginning of 1976.
There's nothing like Rocky's name.
The philosophy of the Red Callium is not part of the cross-sectional and smallness of the game.
He appreciates a lot of games, but it's different things to play a lot harder than a dog.
Last time I'm here, Garrett Stafford sent Tapparan Jere from Karjala to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judge, but Routakallio put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept such a game, and it doesn't belong to a short-distance six-year-old Routakallio after the game to the Satakunna Nation.
This way, the team has been well built.
They're June, vets, cops, and detectives.
There are no key players in the best game.
It's not surprising that the headmaster's been wrong with his ideas.
How much have you been able to influence the players, Pekka Routakallio?
The recent events that affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market were slow, with the diplomatic response of Routakallio.
I'm going down the street.
In 1953, Rautakallio was obviously interested in moving to Toivola to a sports stadium.
Men's contracts end in winter.
There are a number of killings on the ground from 1 to 6.
The hope should not have been supported by a continuous letter of resignation.
Olga Temonen shows Sipe Santabuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing to do with him.
Olga Temonen appears for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm going to find my husband's mother.
Of course, it feels crazy, a sample and a producer of Olga Temon's joke.
He has been married to the Apulanan ex-baser and leader Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The Parisian society has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's leadership.
In the beginning of the years of Apollanna, you made us in a beautiful picture of Sipe Santa Puku's mother, Sirkka.
The circus grows and supports her son, even though this father, Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann), is trying to be a sound.
The more I know about my real destination in the circus, the easier it feels to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuk that he trusted me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the two of them have been very close.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've got messages.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've used a lot of different hills throughout their history.
The circus also appreciates that drama is a drama and that the truth may have a little color.
Olga points out that Sirkka was near Heinala, the only one who sincerely believed that Aplanna would come from Finland's largest band.
At the age of 90, there was a lot of noise and a real challenge.
There was a little chance that someone was really successful, but Sirka had something intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about this youth before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have been slightly different.
So, if you're 15 years old, as many parents really know what you're talking about.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from the wicked Tuuka known as a traitor of Heinola.
Olga was an archipelago and a nice girl who had no film with Tuuka to do anything.
At least he could've kept a secret.
According to Olga, he has worked so much for ten years with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always got great.
Now the whole producer group goes to Heinola for months.
In fact, the Parisian society in the past actually intends to spend time with its little children, often also at home, because the gap is not too long.
We've been ruling for the whole month of Heinala.
They've taken us seriously, they've just asked us what we're going to do and when we're going to be wiped out.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland as the largest model
Timo Vuorensola led by Iron Sky: The Coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
Pictures begin in October in Belgium.
The watchman Timo Vorensola is starting to depict Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Iron Skyn's scaffolding-part, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will raise Finland's biggest example of all times to the EUR 17 million budget.
Previously, the title of Finland's most famous movie has been on the Jalmar Helmar Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after the completion of Iron Sky 2: as the video budget is over EUR 100 million.
The descriptions of the film produced by Timo Vuorensola and Tero Farkoma begin in October near Antwerp near AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
The overseer of Timo Vuorensola is leaving Belgium for the first week.
I'm not afraid of leaving the budget.
I've been in a very sick ride!
I'm so glad I've got the file on the manuscript, because I know exactly what the ceiling should be.
Everyone in the working group feels that they're doing something unexpected.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though it's time, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to see that I'm going to show up at the general of this Leff, he's telling me at night.
The budget of the original film was estimated at 8-10 million, but the budget also grew in the development of the manuscript.
It's a big budget, but it's a big store.
However, the film would be worth 100 million, as each picture and performance is so expensive.
Now everything's turned so tight that no one's found.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a group-funding campaign and a group campaign on Wednesday, which will pay 4-8 per cent annual fee.
The final peak shall be determined according to the demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay back.
The performance picture includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.

Isoto logos return to places
In recent times, trends have taken over the ice logos.
Once again, a well-designed sticker avoided clear and large logos such as Crocsey's consagna.
The mention of the Huppar or t-position mark was found to be in any joint.
It's only time that's changed.
Sports has become a real form of megatrendo, and so do the old, familiar sportsmotors like Adidas and Nike have risen to the bottom of the college.
And as often as before, the limit of noise and trending is noticeable: if there is a right band, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core train, i.e. a pattern where the trenders were surprised by the preferred softest basics of age than by a different method of mass.
Now put on a hard base collegiate instead of the hard core, it's already on the bottom of the cap, which is in front of the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and the better, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, the Adidas are identified by railway networks, the favorite sports team and the New York Yankees leagues have made a return to the castle.
The Calvin Klein logos of the beginners are now cool details.
The trend also appears to be in the transfer of sports brands to the luxury brands.
For example, the circumference of Versace sysmorrhages makes it clear what this is about.
Would you be willing to present your logos to you?
Russia's policy would give evidence: I haven't been able to sing for hours in the army!
According to the findings, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russian Arms Expo 2015 was considered to be a product of the Russian military industry.
In the last days, Russia's media has published colourful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to withdraw large churches from the presence of Serbia's tank for five hours.
In the meantime, he's done everything he can to get information.
He would even publish on his own Facebook page a picture that shows that he's going to squeezing the body of the panserion in very good hours and at least on the basis of their images, it's nothing to be ashamed of or able to do.
I'm a full-fledged lady.
Let's start by saying that I didn't go into the fight fund, but it was the BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, the superintendent, I've served in Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and came out peacefully, Sorov told the Communists of Pravda.
I wasn't Jewish, and I didn't really spend five hours in that apartment, he said.
The Russian army's TV channel, Xorov, explained his admiration for Russia's new technology because he himself is a former professional.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the cars, and I liked our technique.
And I came out through the backyard, he said.
I went through all the tanks.
And in the next show, I'm going to do it in all the tanks and all the sidewalks, you promised.
Sozoov also complained about writing as a typewriter.
One type was written, and all the others were coming back.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and slow, but no matter what I've ever been to the tank, it didn't happen, he told Russia's servant to the novoste radio.
Zorov's words support that no photograph of the alleged suicide has been published, even though the shooting took some 50,000 people for a few days.
From the incident of Zozov, the movement started on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zozov was told about the shootings out of the tank while trying and eventually threatened to shoot all around, unless he got out of the surface.
Later, the Blocnot website would be published, where the exhibition organizers told about what had happened.
Everyone's just used to get soldiers to get out of the truck quickly.
But the ruler of the people, Ezrov, who was brought up from his father's house, simply ran away when he came out.
But he didn't even sit there for five hours, said a demonstration coordinator, Alexander Pisarevski, to the block.
Here's the favorite of the integration bloggers.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland in Kittlän has suffered a fall for the year.
The purified process water of the crop has been so called from the spring of the wheat harvest.
According to the company, measures to fix the year have been initiated.
The altar contains a decomposition of the process by neutralising the flow of rice and cleaning the flow of the process.
In general, water is pumped either to be used for re-processing or to be administered through the environment through a surface environment, according to the licence.
The year was estimated to be about 300 miles per hour [300 km / hr] when it was discovered.
According to the company, the quality of annual water meets the current commitments.
No other substance affected the environment.
The year was found to be due to the inspection period on Monday morning.
The year has not been found to cause structural damage to the floor structures.
The company shall report on close cooperation with the authorities in order to monitor and improve the situation.
The plan is to employ about six reliable workers.
Denmark Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against playing too much
The Finnish country report published by the International Monetary Fund of the IMF today follows closely the views of the Government and the Ministry of State of Finance.
The Commission took steps to address the structural reforms covered by Finland in order to address economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overcrowding and free-of-charges would support Finland’s competitiveness.
The reform would require the entire treaty system as well as the safety of unemployment.
According to the Danish Bank's leading economist Pasi Kuoppamä, structural reforms are of the same opinion, but there are small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of useful messages from the government's action, but on the other hand, there are also warnings about what should not be done too much.
These are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamek tells Talosusnamom.
Growth projects should also support the IMF's idea to implement as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF predicted that this year's 0.4% growth, which will be reduced first year by 0.9%.
Today, Denmark predicts that in the new trend, growth will remain for zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic than this year.
They may have been the last ones to find out.
This morning the Statistics Centre told the total production to be in the middle of a small growth, Kuoppamäki is real.
The weakest confidence of the industry or of other so-called weaker measurements has been able to draw less attention again.
However, the issue is only a few percent of the decimals.
A new leader named Nintendo, a dying man.
In July, working under the heading of Satoru Iwata, Tatsumi Kimishima began working on her midweek work, Nintendo told her about her day.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002, and she was recommended and a charismatic growth in the field.
Iwata, for example, successfully responded to the Wii console's launch.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishman is not surprising.
He was one of those who were raised to represent Iwata as possible followers.
Kimishima is a safe choice for Iwata's haircuts, an Ace Research analyst for the Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see the removal of Nintendo by means of mobile games, but so that it does not feed the company's grip on traditional toys.
Finland will be able to obtain more and more temporary asylum seekers
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Office recognized that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing annually.
This has been reported, inter alia, by the Swedish Immigration Office, on the website of the SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, to eliminate hundreds of minor applicants per year.
The Director of the Agency for Foreign Affairs will tell the Republic of Finland what the situation is and how it has changed.
Do you have the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants are missing under this year? - In Finland, 156 were granted a temporary asylum application in 2013 alone.
You lost 9 of them.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 were lost in Candelma.
It may be that in dealing with the matter, the applicant is already registered in another country in which the Dublin Regulation applies and may have been found to be complete.
In this case, the applicant may be more inclined to lose than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to return to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014 the asylum seekers in Finland were all 3651, of whom 134 were granted an asylum decision because the applicant was likely to have changed from Finland, so the adult asylum seekers lost 123 over the last year, he says.
Is there a lot of growth?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for temporary asylum alone.
The total number of asylum seekers lost this year is not yet available, but the number of asylum seekers is then known and it has grown clearly, which is likely also affecting the number of missing persons, and it is stressed.
How is the translation decision going to be?
Are they also missing, for example, the black labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because the implementation of the reverse decisions is in the hands of the police, which is stressed by the Cannela.
Interior Minister Petter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered attemptors in the country.
He's been running out of action.
At the EU internal ministerial meeting, Orpo reported on the practical activities on the ground where the power of asylum seekers can be managed by Sweden through Sweden.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
The sale is now under way by the sales of Timo T.A. Mikkosen TV and radio production, which has been lost in the area due to illness.
For the part of Mikkos, Nina Mikkonen sells Huuto.net devices that were currently the most advanced of professional tools.
The first website on the Internet was on my nightkasin.
Today, much of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam diseases are no longer described.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interest will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer modern, but they are also needed as long as there is an existing substance of an old generation that must be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are a lot of contractors and the construction of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen's back to the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to change their current home in Myrskylän.
We can't take everything with us.
I've started an inventory, and I've started to see what kind of goods they're creating.
This is what I'm starting to say, Nina Mikkone.
There's no use for TV and radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the consequences of brain damage that a man has not done a long time ago to get back to work.
Nina Mikkone notes that now we only sell goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's early life was already archived in the middle of the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives went on film trading and other material from Myrskylä.
The danger of traffic being threatened is worse: Metro and rail can be stopped as a whole
Metron and railway transporters today decide whether to expand their activities across the country of thought.
The original plan was to establish a time limit for the transport of metro and bicycles by the spring.
In the morning, I'll decide if you'll stop your traffic all day.
Mr Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
Night and day breaks are bad for drivers, so the government's plans to cut the bonds will raise the challenge.
However, it is not clear that the establishment of transport throughout the day is a dilemma.
If the metro and the railway are set up as a family, the public transport is practically stopped by the capital city.
According to VR, the birds do not fly during the spring between morning and evening.
As a family, they're not moving close to you, they're not moving around.
The boys who left before the morning will be taken to the deadlines.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain on the west coast.
The members of the AKT are away from work on Friday morning at three o'clock in the morning.
Probably a small amount of buses can be taken over, they are assumed to be the primary power, HSL's informant Pirkko Repo calculates.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus routes are going through.
Retirement organisations will organise a major event at the Helsinki Rautaticentor on Friday from 11 to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: The Hungarian police used gas in exchange for refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees in the summer.
The event took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, were also refugees in the country.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water stations against people.
The Muslim boy was held in school in Texas - the teacher thought of his own neck as a bomb
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher took his school as his own boss.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to just present his e-mail invitation.
However, one of the teachers seemed to be a real bomb.
The police were summoned to the scene, and the situation ended with the boy being put in custody in the custody of the young man.
Mohammed has not been proved at any stage, claiming otherwise than he had done on the clock.
However, it is still possible for the boy to be accused of making a lie.
According to Mohamed, the police had proved to be a "stupid bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of clearly border crossings and digital exhibitions between the leaders.
The killing took place in the last few days, and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days in exile from school.
His father is based on the case at his borders and the American-Islamic Council of the country, whether the case is again an indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
British County - Director of Labour refused to sing national songs
The song asks God to protect the royal palace, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The Court of Justice has also joined the national rapporteurs for the Court of Justice of Corbyn.
This has created a nation, a number of labs, the director of Kate Green's public radio company in the BBC radio station.
I think Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
In the former memorial service, British air carriers were respected for their fight against Germany’s Luftwaffe in 1940.
The working party defends in its official opinion Corbynia and stresses its respect for the aircraft by taking part in the opportunity.
We are all in great gratitude for the sacredness of royal air carriers.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully quietly during the national elections, and was stressed in the opinion.
Corbyin's election as vice president has broken the lab's ribs.
In particular, a group of representatives of the people are those who are afraid of his brutal opponents on radical views.
Corby supports one-half of the siege, the cessation of savings, and the growth of public expenditure.
The number of Corbynins is today the first time in the capacity of the vice-president in Parliament at the Prime Minister's question.
Corbyn has asked the general about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
At the weekend of Cameron's novel, on Twitter, Corbyn will be elected as the vice president.
The working party threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, and the Prime Minister insists on his own reputation.
I remember the reason why my family was still in the wrong... the father of the family was waiting for justice
The South Lake Minneton police have been investigating the incident in Minnesota in Greenwood.
Five families were found dead on September 10th, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
The first time he beat his wife and three of them were killed by Brian Short in a car car.
I've been dead for years.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the hall for inspection and found a large house for the Short family to die.
According to StarTubinen, it is possible that the victims had been dead for years.
Monetary sector and successful business
The investigation of the case of the South Lake Minneton police officer Michael Citar is still under way.
The motive for blood transfusions is still unclear.
Ampuja Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014 in the StarTribunnen questionnaire Short reported four million different times a week on the website.
I've been given 50 purchases by the company in the last 10 years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to make.
Kens, at some point, I'm selling the company, but I'm not yet.
It was seen, among other things, that the Short family bought two million dollars in 2011 from Greenwood.
The room is mentioned at the property site in Zillowi: there are only 12 bedrooms in the house, and there are eight cars available.
Jurisdiction of the Office
According to StarTubinen, however, the father of the family expected justice.
Achiev Test Prep, offered by various Prep Courses, had challenged him due to comments on the AllNurses.com site.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, the Short website had not removed comments from prep course reviews and thus lost customers to competitors.
According to StarTubinen, however, it is very unclear whether the exercise of justice would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered two coffees
In addition, the owner was paid for the treatment with the Finnish monthly horseman.
It's a great thing, Loir's comment as a beautiful kingdom.
The published Fabrice Duo won Derby's first day in September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist's band, Loir, was still surprised by Fabrice Duon's success in the big competition.
I still don't think that's happened.
Corpi, the manufacturer of the Menstyshevos, says Loir, will get a full-time job with a horse at work.
Pick up and decide which horse you're going to take to compete.
And I'm gonna have to hold my ass, Loir.
A wonderful ele of NHL - "A gift made by the greatest dancer of all ages"
The Montreal Canadiens Superhero P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about EUR 6.7 million) to the Children's Hospital in Montreal.
According to the report of the hospital, the fact that the greatest player of all time is a single gift for charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital in another storage facility for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadians eight years ago and 72 million dollars a year.
The amount of the Sobhan's gift is therefore significantly greater than its $9 million annual value.
In return, Subban is given a hospital called a hospital hall.
Canadian players have previously been significantly assisted by local hospitals.
Last year, Captain Jean Beleveau spent millions of dollars, including the same hospital for children, and Saku Koivu spent money on another city's major hospital, where a PET scanner needed for food research was sent to the hospital.
Japanese coffee can stay with my wife for the night - offers food only bikini and cheese on top of the table.
The topical coffees are a serious case in Japan.

It's about Metro.

At least 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: vehicle safety attacks have been made available
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports the development and innovation of the field, as well as in the information published by Intel.
It is composed of security experts from various parts of the world.
ASRB researchers will be required to carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardizing best practices and planning for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will continue to update its report on the basis of the ASRB research results.
The International ICT Research and Consultancy Company Gartner estimates that by 2020, the vehicle transport volume of about 150 million has been linked to the network.
Few things are more personal than our security on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60 to 75 per cent of these vehicles can be used, created and distributed online data.
We can and we need to improve the safety of cars, Intel Security Manager Chris Young says.
Using ASRB, Intel can ensure the best use of safety and support for vision, which means that cybersecurity is important for each network connected to the design of a car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road that makes the ASRB platform the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Forum Focus RS model has been expected to rise for years as a month.
Later, the car also began to be in the area of Finland.
Ford published RS's information now when the eyes of the car world are on Frankfurt's car display.
The new four-wheel RS is speeded up by a 2,3-litre, 350-powered engine in 4.7 seconds and the speed is 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also high, initially EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, indeed, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in the press.
The brand Kia presented two news on Frankfurt's auto show - such are new Sportage and Optima.
In Finland, the two news is probably more important than the new fourth generation Sportage, in which Kia is planning to move ahead with the ever-increasing public of the growing waste market.
In the form of a new European shape leader, Gregory Guillaume, the sport created is more round.
I've come to the Accessian and External Committees, another one here, and the car is getting more efficient than that.
The engine option is at its top, but it adds a 1.6-litre turbo to 177 horsepower.
Add Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption to the next sales revenue.
We still have to wait a little longer because we will have a new Sportage in summer 2016.
Because a year ago, our country had a new Kia Optim.
Well, maybe the news doesn't look like a change, but there's a really new car.
Kia aims to soften the hearts of the top-class buyers by better weather characteristics, lowering the threshold and higher the equipment.
In the beginning, Optimota is supplied with 1,7 litres of turbodies and 2,0 litres of petrol engines.
First of all, they want to slow down when they get to their shore with a 2.0-litre turbo engine equipped with Optima GT.
At the same time, it will start the sale of Optima Farmer.
Chisu returned to the folds - fired in a strong battle.
Singer Chisu is involved in a life for the children at a concert with other guests.
In the power supply, the fuel supply needs to be visible, as it were.
The house is a beautiful concert hall in the middle of the siren.
It's a crown of gold metal and a red cloth.
During a three - year period, the singers who became the mother have received heavy loads charged with driving and sleeping.
Chisun's daughter's gonna be a year.
The psalmist would publish his first song again in August.
I went back to classes and to the big public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
It's been a while since all the music is involved, the singer tells me.
Chisu publishes a couple of weeks after the new and the same four albums called Polaris.
Your new way of life has been inspired to create new bones.
At this stage, you'll think about whether people will find my new album, Chisu.
Kim Kardashin's mother-style re-examined.
Real-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives the talks one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy and breast-feeding in sexual clothing, last night a time of American time when she took her sister, Kourtney Kardasian, out of the kitchen with her husband, Kanye West.
The black mother's face is a passable on the walls.
It exposes the beautiful oranges that are below the surface of the sandy plains.
Finally, Cardashia was hit by the mammothity of her childhood when she went to her friend’s funeral in New York only a few days later.
The roofs lifted the black roof over the ceiling.
The third special maternity rate is as short as last week's average when the presentation period was heavy.
The world's worst devices: Not home, you're alone, competition is terrible
However, Manon Leloup wanted to understand that the painting world would be clean of glamorous and anti-smokers.
He made his documentary speech Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak of the painting as a clean picture.
The Harpeer's Bazaar's version of Leloupin's six hard truths for the class's assurance.
Every season starts empty.
Even if you'd been posing in the minds of the planners in the past, the new time would begin again in castings.
And every long time there will come new, young adults who compete with their peers.
There's rarely a place they can call your home.
The work is continuous travel and can last year so that it is a hotel room or apartment in which the buildings rent their furniture.
If he is too young, and his mother cannot travel with him, loneliness can be a difficult challenge.
New York and Paris are desired jobs, but they are the most stressful.
It's not just one kind of mess.
An agent in New York may ask for a raining kilogram, but in Paris it is said that you are too weak.
Getting a job is a full-time risk game.
Design models and designers are all the time together and work in the same support network.
When we're done, the difference is bad.
The models want this area because of the opportunities it offers, but they claim that everyone thinks that the job is just a presentation of clothes.
They also want to be their own person.
Work gets models to know that they're models that have a role.
But the painting work can also reveal itself.
You're painting in Tory Burchin's show yesterday.
In New York, the best design shows where designers reveal their first year of painting.
The style changed by Roope Salminen presents an unknown Apulanta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents the founder of the band, Antti Lautala, based on the Apulanta Society's original years.
The platform was founded in Apulan in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but separated from one in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I've been a rap artist for 26 years, and in this film I'm a 16-year-old karateist, Salmin's narahta.
I didn't want to see the real Anttia before the descriptions, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.

Psychology advice: I told the children about the refugees
Many parents have had to consider, last day, how to tell the child about the refugee situation in Europe.
Or do you mind telling me about it at all?
It doesn't have to be a violent voice, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff's advice.
Younger children are encouraged to protect themselves, and for example, they are not allowed to look at the news on their own.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be a little bit of a thought and worry, he says.
However, if your child has been distracted by TV newscasts or heard about something else, it will encourage him to speak.
The discussion is good to take the child’s starting point and to listen carefully to what he is asking.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones whose parents think they're afraid of him.
The child doesn't have to be afraid of harm, even if he'd hurt himself and be afraid.
The younger the child follows his parent closely.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will try to be safe.
Most children probably break out of the conversation at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to talk to them about the matter if they think about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are good.
Parents can discuss with their children how to deal with this.
However, is the world a safe, safe place in the end?
Parents may also have different opportunities for growth - some may want to protect their children from the dangers of breast - feeding.
On the other hand, if you are also discussing difficult things in the family, the child will be taught how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.

You're done with your powers?
However, you can be a better parent to your child.
Vermoo's beautiful Palosalam hard castles
Perttu North was hit by the Appilan Palosalama in the middle of the winter.
It only cured winners and doubles until the end of July at Tampere's fair.
Because the product was sold on the ground, the manufacturer doubted the existence of something and tried to protect him from animal doctors for a while.
The explanation for the action would be important.
The horse had a victim's injury.
The people were not the worst to reach, but it took two doctors to get it to bed.
Since Apila Palosalama had to be on the smooth road, North is telling her that she was in favour of the last flight of the horse.
It was in the preamble to the second SE post-Turuntu.
The Apila Palosalama was very heavy on the table when it was usually only a few weeks away.
Well, at the end of that little attention thing, it was understandable, North said.
The manufacturer assumes that the fair competition has made the gold land.
The horse’s wrath must have gone forward, and hopefully it would have been restored too.
The Apila Palosalama has been said to have been such a humour.
When it's not interesting, it's been able to throw in the middle without any illness.
On a good day, the originals have been replaced by such a sandy list that opposers have been in their own hands.
During the summer, the passengers will not go to Palosalam, where even the hot springs will come out.
There's a hiding place in the north of Vermosa.
However, there are different things about how Apilaan Pallosalama feels about it.
It's a hard time at the time of departure, and it's possible, even if a wooden car is by the tree and that's it.
Hopefully, the gold would be more peaceful than at the start of the market.
Apilan Palosalama is well able to come from the lake as well, and we are going to be able to enjoy the victory, the manufacturer's promise.
For this reason, you can't get away from the remote iPhone program.
I'm app delivery director Tim Cook.
At least I share the future program with Apple iPhone calls, maybe in the future, but not all of them.
Apple might want to remove some of its own programs from the iPhone, tells the company's delivery director Tim Cook Buzzfeed in the questionnaire.
There are a number of programs that relatively rarely use, such as FaceTime calls, Logic, Health, Press, Podcasts and Vinkit.
The last addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an update to the iPhone phone, although it is only necessary for Apple's intellectual owners.
According to Cook, removing the App programs is more complicated than it appears on the surface.
Some applications have been linked to someone else's iPhone.
If they're removed, it can cause problems somewhere else in the phone, Cook's gonna make Bizzfeed.
Cook did not mention what the Apple iPhone applications do specifically with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop the habit of letting the user take them away from you, Cook.
According to Cook, Apple then investigates the matter, because the company does not want to delete a memo from the user's iPhone.
The euro area inflation fell by 0.1% in August
The euro area consumer prices rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year, the EU Statistical Office of Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices led to lower energy consumption.
Eurostat is therefore reassessed by 0.2% a few weeks in advance.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
Thus, in August, the said primary inflation dropped by 0.9 per cent from July to July by 1.0 per cent.
Eurostat's baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2% worse than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In June, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Most of Europe's prices rose by 1.4 per cent in August in Malta.
Cyproxic inflation was at a lower rate of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent of the minimum mark according to the EU's harmonised price index.
The euro area inflation continues to be slowly away from the target of the European Central Bank (ECB) which is a two-percent increase in the medium-term price.
The ECB predicts the euro area for this year's average inflation of 0.1 per cent.
In the first year, growth rose by 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicted the publication of new inflation services in early September.
In the United States, Fed is trying to break money policy next time
In the United States, the next move will start at the speed of less than a year, but probably three years later, when the central bank of the country, Fed, is moving back to its peaks for a long time.
And the financial market will also start to defend itself before the next fall.
Fed has missed its initial condolences this week and by the end of the year.
Thus, the next shift can be put on top as quickly as possible by the first time I go to the market and before I make it to the financial market.
Or at least this happens if the world's biggest economy and the financial market are working as they have done - and if they react to hidden Fed's funds as they have done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank London's market research strategies for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a long-term market and economic cycle study.
The bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to the international major stakeholders last week.
The research and report-based strategies do not believe in knowing exactly when Fed is going to climb its heights or what is happening in the economy and on the market after that.
Instead, they present the facts and calculations of economic statistics using the facts and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously been used during and after the feds.
In addition to historical findings, they examine which key changes in the economic and financial markets are now at the same time or in a different form than in the time of the summits - and what may be followed by them.
However, both the economy and the financial market are now in a better position to sustain the rise of peaks than ever before in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the year, maybe not a year.
The leaders of Fed's monetary policy and its customs office have been in the past for a long time and are beginning to argue that time begins to be able to climb the mountains.
The first survey of over nine years can be held this week.
The matter shall be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday following the meeting of the Open Market Committee so stated at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed did so, as stated by Fed Funds, in June 2006.
This led to a two-year period of relatively regular but repeated series of 0,25 per cent corrosion units, with Fed reaching a level of 1,25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial market crisis began in 2007 on the United States' most risk-weighted housing financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis was re-examined as a global burden on the day of judgment.
The great tsunami was hit in 2009.
In the last few years, the serious abuses of the financial markets and the real economy have started more closely than in the wake of more recent Feds' mergers.
Accordingly, trials were more severe and more serious than ever before in the 1930 ’ s.
Deutschen’s strategies have been based on the world’s largest economic growth and wages, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950 and in place since the early 1800s.
From the 1950 ’ s, they made a clear picture of Fed’s trends and their economic and financial effects.
The start of the study has taken the first time in less than a year, usually less than three and a half years, and less than three and a half years.
The financial market rate has ended within two years from the start of Fed's coronation.
Fed's been up and down in the morning after the early 1950s.
Each time it has been removed from some of the others, and the reports are being considered relatively narrow, so on the basis of them, it is unlikely that any of the following trends will have any effect.
The strategies also remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
The curves are too low too long
The root causes of the financial crisis are not necessarily to be identified with certainty even by research for decades.
But the three causes of the crisis and the reasons why it is so devastating are no doubt evident:
1) Feds, the ECB and other world’s largest central banks have been too fat for too long in the 2000s.
They were following a technical plan, and they also grew the following.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, the paced pace of the 20-year period, and above all, too much debt has increased from the impact of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt in the economic history of this country was born.
3) In particular, as far as the financial economy was concerned, the debt relief provided for most areas of the financial market was the largest cost of the financial history of the financial history in question for the participating entities, liabilities and benefits.
Furthermore, it is very difficult to argue that the financial market, which is still high among the more complex debt lines, was at a low risk and uncertain level when Fed and the other central banks finally came up on top.
The financial institutions entrusted with the loans received no consideration until after the consolidations had begun and the cost of debt treatment had been increased.
The risks were a financial crisis, and you followed it a lot.
Bigger cup and more debt
Deutschen’s strategies do not consider what is going on, but give the subject of inspiration by mentioning, for example, the following steps:
1) Feds and other large central banks have now maintained their monetary policy offices more easily than before the financial crisis.
If, before the crisis, the roots were too deep, they are now even worse.
2) The debt has not been as bad for a long time as ten years ago, but now the debt is worse in writing than in air.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been eased but now in various parts of the economy, the debt burden of the brother is slightly higher than before the financial crisis or at least once in time.
3) The first lower and lower liquidity from central banks has remained largely on the financial market and have lost the key securities and assets to the most expensive or at any time before the financial crisis.
Not only do the strategies of Latin America recognize the warning marks of the financial markets, but they also note that even the United States economy has not yet responded to the financial crisis and the most difficult ten years have passed.
The euro area economy must have taken action at all.
In other words, the real economy is indistinguishable but correspondingly the pressures and risks of the financial markets are undoubtedly greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed is next going to hide the burden on the financial sector.
Maybe the future picture of the French bank of the Society's General Strategy Albert Edwards' future is not as strange as it can immediately affect.
He has already prepared international investors from the bank for the following provisions:
First, Fed climbs up hills, then the financial plans relax, and soon it is time for Fed to climb the financial dividends in even larger QEs.
The Hewlett-Packard (HP) is designed to reduce even 33,000 jobs.
The share of the government's reductions refers to the part of the HP business service, the company tells.
HP is distributed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumer-oriented HP Inc.
HP was the largest staff in 2011, with 350,000 employees.
In October last year, the staff was suspended by 302000.
The company shall record the estimated cost of $2.7 billion (about €2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25000-30000 employees.
The decreases in the consumer share will remain at 3300 over three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60 per cent of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company shall report its balanced business in such a way that none of its clients no longer respond to more than 10 per cent of its business results.
In the next year, the three major customers brought 65 percent of the profit.
iOS 9: how to get a new system after the iPhone App's update release
The new application system can be requested by going to the Settings application by clicking the "Update" button and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then set it.
Some have had problems after this installation when the exhibition has been shown to be a "Software Update" bug.
To accomplish this, it is recommended that users either wait for the best spirit medium or try to update through the iTunes program.
I'm teaching the user in the final process.
This may include the removal of applications for the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the total update and also facilitating processes in the new tool, which proposes removing applications and then re-install them in the preparation of the update.
Please make sure that the phone is loaded or closed in the closet during the update, that the clock does not end in the middle.
If the download level is too low, Apple does not give the update progress, because if the clock ends in the middle, it can lead to a deterioration of the update.

More: Minister Berner has been active in the government of the Tax Corporation
Mr Anne Berner, Minister for Transport and Communications, has acted as a member of the Government of the Tax Administration, according to Ulen.
According to the above, the company's activities relate to so-called tax planning.
This is the case with the Luxembourgese Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed a member of the government named Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself said that he had left a notice of separation in May this year.
I checked the case, and it's enough that I've left a separate report.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that registration marks occur at a suitable time interval, says Berner in Ylen's questionnaire.
Concentration after merger
The property of the Swedish Kährs company is managed through the Luxembourg-based company.
Kährs is a parking loter who founded a Finnish parking loter with Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner works in the Government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Government of Kärrs and in the Luxembourg branch.
According to the above, the properties of Khärs are moving through the multi-port property building in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he has taken the request of the largest owner of the company in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been with Hartwall Capital, the government of Karelia-Upofloo.
The company was called for cooperation from Sweden.
This company is owned by the head of the company, which has a company in Luxembourg.
I realized that my task was to take care of the success of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the products of our Finnish company's capital are taxed in Finland and that the point of departure was secured in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells the General that Hartwall Capital's assets do not involve tax planning in the company.
According to Berner, the multiple ownership structure capable of tax is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in Khärs had already set up a Luxembourg holding company for the property.
Esposo opens the company’s maintenance centre
In Espoo Otania, the first maintenance centre of the company is open to adult asylum seekers.
The response centre is ready to take the first hundred residents from tonight.
The number of seats can be increased within the week by at least 300-400 people.
The Agency for Migration shall be based on the establishment of the Centre for Rehabilitation.
The operation is to be monitored by Luona Oy, which is particularly involved in the production of health care and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Luona Oy agree with the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK prepares an alternative job encryption package
STTTK will prepare an alternative package for government jobs.
The company also hopes that other employees will be employed.
According to President Antti Palola, there is now a major concern in the country of thought.
In alternative ways, to reduce the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life continues after spring, Palola took note of the organization’s management meeting with the suppliers.
Palola considered that the Central European Union (EC) is not prepared for the discussions instead.
The STTK economists have calculated that the amount of the restructuring security contained in the Government’s competitiveness package will be EUR 30 million for the employee when the other side of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of trouble on the part of the party to have a discussion if there's one hundred.
Palola: The negotiations must have been built up
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central). - (FR) Mr President, I hope that the election will take place by Wednesday, as the government will then have to give its own package of information to the press and start preparing the reforms.
Palola didn't take the position if it's realistic.
The discussion with the government is based on Palola's existence, and it has been about him to build all the time.
In particular, the STTK country's solar system is located on Palola.
The Council requires that the government withdraws from the proposed legislation which would have been implementing some of the infringements.
According to the STTK, Palola does not provide us with an alternative package to prepare the matter with the SDP.
In the past week, employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to protest against the government's offer of a working life-saving package.
Part of the package, i.e. the first days of the illness, the overcrowding, the sunscreens will be reduced to 75% and the ceiling will be reduced.
The STTTK stresses that the central organisations have called employers into their country of opinion and that there has been no purpose in the scheme.
Akavan Fäder thanks
The President of the Board, Mr Fjäder, appreciates the announcement made by the STTTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fäder, the STTTK will now come to the same line with Akava, as Akava has more advanced options for the government's presentation.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also be provided with an alternative package, because without SAK, it is not enough.
President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fjäder, hopes that Lauri Lyly, the future leader of the SAK, will prepare the options presented for the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTTK told us earlier this Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want to change security and work time.
In the mid-week, Akava was informed that it has already prepared its own presentation, which is ready to negotiate with the Government of the country for five per cent of the competitive capacity option for cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have already written a long list of options for government presentations.
We are ready to consider the terms of service as part of the agreement.
On the contrary, we want changing security and working time banks, says President Sture Fäder.
Fäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akawa lines, as STTTK has done in the midweek period.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We're now preparing together a model for the government and the workers of the country, Fäder says.
The Committee of the Economic and Social Committee shall meet at 15 a.m. on the possible content of the Agreement.
"The same beast, the common whale, the dragons" - play bingo in Sipil's speech at night
Green Left of Tampere University
The Vian bingo of the University of Tampere for the night.
The prime ministers have previously held special talks during the Méntsela camp and the war.
Prime Minister Ruha Sipilä speaks very differently to the people of Finland about the state of the Finnish economy at the midweek Ylen Canal at 21.05.
In 1932, when asked to speak with the Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the Prime Minister was holding the famous radio talk that marked the beginning of the end of the Mantsla Capina.
After that, the president and the ministers held several radio talks during the winter and the summer season.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho took President Mauno Koivisto instead of speaking for the new year, but it was more ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekkone ended up on television with the law of the Union's sponsors.
A single call, a monarchist, mine.
Sippel’s speech has raised every day’s criticism and criticism of what to come.
President of the left-hand side, Mr Arrhimäki, pointed out on Twitter that "Sipila could keep her speech on the status of the nation in the presidency as a statement by the Prime Minister, where she would also be able to discuss it."
According to the Green Ville Ninistung, "the single call has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Toimios judged on Facebook that "Monarchist of mine: the prime minister tells the people what's best for it".
SDP's president, Antti Rinne, asked the Siplia's dialogue: "I'm half a year old.
Not only did the prime ministers meet with the media opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Council, the Siplian language has previously been raised and lasted about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented directly by SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, and EC delivery director Jyri Häkämmies.
The public has been assessed for the presentation of the Sipel language.
We considered the matter and determined that it is part of the public service task to promote the comprehensive public of Finland, on the line of the Director of the Public Publications of Ismo Silvo Ylen in the news.
As in the Time of the Times
The speech has also raised the irradiations.
Day after day comes the sun will enjoy good times, children will be cut down and the best will be eaten.
Mother wears a beautiful shirt on top, and her father fits her shoes.
At 9:00 a.m., we are late on television than before we remember at the time of the Tammelos," writes a blogger Saku Timonen.
"When Prime Minister Sipila also speaks about why in the Finnish government there are millions of hidden assets in taxable capitals, which make up for other taxable taxpayers' savings accounts, and also tell the nation that there is a need to save when the government's money is over?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipil says, one opinion is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's published on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same Russian, the common cold, the noise of living, and the rest of the group?
Cups and cookies ready, at 21.05 it starts and canadas are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
At Ahtisaari Guardian: The People's Party Against the Elimination of Russia's Al-Assad proposal · Global Voices
The last three years have fought against Russia's offer to which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was allowed to surrender, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisa, Russia's UN Secretary-General has proposed a plan to which al-Assad would have been able to speak in a satisfactory way after some time.
However, the latter did not agree with the proposal because they believed that al-Assad was missing within a few weeks.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaer, Russia's Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed him in the two-centred debate the three-point plan: the opposition did not receive weapons, opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the petition against al-Assad had to be completed gradually.
I know Tshurkin.
We don't have to agree on all the same things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that you sit down with Alas, Martti, so I tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari reminds you of Guardian's question.
Diplomats are not commentaries
The Ahtisaari tells his message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but it does not say two words.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisara's claims, but said that al-Assad's troops had already made numerous mob members and the central opposition groups refused all the agreements he had left behind.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the British Foreign Ministry of the Middle East, is in a position to address the doubts expressed by Ahtisa, because Russia, according to his experience, was never ready to discuss the case of al-Assad at any time.
Officially Russia has supported al-Assadia throughout the war.
In Ahtisa's claim, the reason for the failure is that Tshurkin spoke to Moscow's authorities.
If he had told me about the Tshurkin, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President from Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have doubted whether Putin's intention was to hold power under some of the support of al-Assad.
Our own acts of worship
During the negotiations in Ahtisa, the Syrian crisis killed about 7,500 people.
According to the U.S. estimates, the death penalty was over 220 000 in the beginning of the year.
Over 11 million people have had to break their codes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The transformation of refugees into Europe is our own business.
I don't see any other options than to take good care of these rich people.
We're paying the bill that we made ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
A security centre for asylum seekers by Turkish Torniaon
The planning of the Government in Northern Finland for asylum seekers is likely to be based on Tornion.
The centre would be based on the construction of the central city of Turin, which is empty.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to improve the management of refugees from Sweden.
Helsing's saying that the authority would have already decided to present a school building to the Ministry of Finance.
According to Saul Hyeppis, the mayor of the city of Tornion, he does not take his place.
When the whole authority was not in college and part of the message wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the first countries to decide on the matter, and he refers to the STT.
In the debate, 36 were authorized from 43.
On the contrary, 13 members of the Consequences Division were authorized.
On the basis of this, it could be expected that the decision would be a positive one, the beautiful word.
According to Mayor Timo Nousais, the city received no communication on the subject as a country, and the matter was responded quickly.
The Community would be able to assess 500 asylum seekers several times.
The applicant has examined that it could apply to such use.
There's a couple of meters on the wall, so it's still working in the mind of the New Testament.
Sip still hopes for a job market option for the blinds
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) in the public, the allocation of funds would only cover a part of the government's objective of calculating the price of work.
However, the Government considers it to be against the option package if labour market organisations succeed in making such agreements.
She told the rapporteur that she had not been in contact with the labour market organizations.
He also did not know how serious the organizations were looking for alternatives to reporting to the government to the unemployed.
If such an agreement is created, we will take it without any other vote against it as part of the complete package.
The sharing of funds would be effective in the view of Cyprus, since it would represent almost all employees other than, for example, the government's planning of sunsets.
The labour market organisations could be able to agree on the cut-off of wages because they have been written instead of the labour market agreements.
The Government shall report to the public on the hidden work of the Council of State on the first Wednesday of the week.
According to the summit, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
There's no final speaker at all.
The legislative work then goes on to move, that is, the jungle is moving, and it's going to be more difficult all the time.
It's a good time.
I won't go long in such things if you want to.
In the last week of publication of the government, the list includes the modification of the final and hero's salary as free of charge for a period of one year without delay.
In addition, the first days of illness pay will be cancelled, overcrowded, sundry taxes will be reduced to 75 per cent and unemployment will be reduced.
The reforms are being carried out as a mandatory legislative end of professional associations, which has raised a strong appreciation.
Retirement agencies are organizing a major conference on the basis of action, which has also been published by many professional agencies.
The Customs Authority approved the extension of the land stock
The Customs Authority unanimously accepted the extension of the property of the Land of the village of Nordic Koivu Oy, a small village in the district of northern Koivu.
The assessment led to the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than the original version was spoken.
Also, a fast-paced time period is very close.
It was little wonder, too, that the need for statistics was not known the year after the previous enlargement was completed.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock was adopted by 400-450 square metres in the investment programme, but the fund was further concluded in relation to the equity report.
The presentation also discussed the investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Iconen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported by the fact that it brings work and taxes to the local community.
There is no risk, because the company pays for the investment, the Water Forest (ps.) was based.
Place of worship in the language of Joensusus
The city administration had previously taken steps to bring the Catholic Catholic movement to the center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right to think about the choice of military tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu is not published as the capital of the capital of the Caribbean, because it does not have historical grounds and the language of the Caribbean is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensun area has become more and more popular in the early Soviet Union.
After the new decision, there will be no catholic catalytic disturbances in the city.
However, the city of Joensuu is, in case of a good view, also prepared for the introduction of the language of the kalara, such as in the information language and on the travel market.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single country, he also supports the use of the language of the kalara, which is now widely known as the life and culture of the North Karillas.
The language of Karjalan is still unique in the country, as well as the most popular Joensusta throughout Finland as a forest town.
Both can be used well in many forms of the country’s market.
Derogations of relations affect the animal health of the country
The interconnectors are trying to force the country to live with a strong hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economic life and competitiveness of the country.
And this affects whether they can stay here and do work, President Kari Karjalain is surprised.
He also highlights the transport which has also been repeated several times in the report.
For the whole country, it is important that our opportunities not be reduced by government measures, as is now being used.
The effects of these traffic connections should be considered, for example, on the job force of Karjaline.
The deterioration of cultural relations is due to increased attractiveness to the University of East Finland.
Of course, the best services here, such as traffic connections and your apartment, are easier to get students and employees, and the fact is that Director Jukka Mönkönen of the University of Eastern Finland is true.
He notes that bad travel connections also affect the research community, which is very moving and travel much for research.
The Recruitment Commissioner Marko Junkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university in the West Finland because travel connections are in short supply.
About half of the students of the University of East Finland will now come from outside of East Finland.
There are also about 10-20% of them, which is explained in part by direct contact.
You've come to my sister's army.
The view of Joensuu’s urban management of your country’s military project is apparently unique, but there is one group of soldiers.
Mr Pentti Kesksalalo (S.A.), speaking at the government's Mayan meeting, said that the entire project had been abandoned, but his presentation was undisputed.
The Government adopted a decision by Mayor Kari Karjala, which is yet to be revised before the meeting of the municipal administration, which gives a final opinion at the same time with all other citizens.
One union in Kotkasa Kouvola's end in the first year
Your personal transport from Kotkakovola will remain in the future, even though it is one of the rarest Europeans.
Changes in personal transport between Kotka and Kouvola will occur first in March.
One of the Europeans will leave, but on Friday, he will arrive at Kouvola and the opposite.
Suspension is caused by State storage operations.
For the next four years, the United Kingdom of Transport and Communications has reduced the total amount of EUR 12.3 million to the next quarter.
The quietest roads are to be stopped.
VR created new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys were stuck in the hole, one didn't get down, the guys moved out.
The rescue plant survived a severe fall at 12 years of age, which was not able to escape from the loss of its own aid.
The situation was born in Toronto, Ketotia, about six o'clock in the morning.
There's an old two-year-old tree where there's no way to get closer to the cat.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to cut down the roof to the roof of the room next to it.
Some of the boys got the same route down, but not one.
The result was that the others moved from place to place and the shipyards warned the rescue plant instead of helping the vets to return safely to the ground.
FedEx’s business objective is a double, lowering the views of the 2016 tax year
FedEx reported massive results at the latest for the last quarter, and the delivery was slowed down throughout the year, due to the decline in demand for railway services and the higher costs of its services.
The company also said it was going to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for hours.
Last year, FedEx reported that it was paying 50,000 seasonal workers for hours.
It accounted for about 2.5 per cent of the open sale 45 minutes before the midweek opening.
FedEx Corp. says it is expected first in May as a result of the final tax year of 10,40-10,90 dollars, which is 20 cents lower than the most accurate forecast.
The analysts expected $10.84 to be told about FactSet.
The smaller sights came despite the average price cuts of 4.9 per cent coming into force on 4 January and despite the higher taxes that began in November in the rural areas of heavy or large packages.
The company said that it expects a growing business target from the previous year, because they have incurred costs, trade change has increased and network sales are growing.
The president and the CEO Fred Smith said that the company "will be firmly established in view of the expected deterioration in economic conditions in particular in production and in global trade."
The plans for the loan period were published on the day after the UPS competitor said he was going to pay 90-95,000 extra workers, at the same rate as it paid last year.
By the end of 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The contribution per share amounted to $2,42, which remained at $2,44 on average. A 12-year analysis was carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
The trade shift is 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts in Zacks' case expected $112.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a decrease in international priority movements over the past year, which has stopped the development of its Express unit's trade change.
However, the increase in network sales has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the domestic unit increased by 29 per cent, but the results of the activities were basically the same as the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic taxes, while the business target in the mining industry was lower than the labour costs.
Open-house sales amounted to about an hour before FedEx's opening ceremony cost $3.85, i.e. 2.5 per cent of $15.15.
FedEx included 11 per cent of cigarettes for this year and 17 per cent below the forecast of 11 June.
In the United States, the Central Bank’s decision-makers will be sitting this week for two days at a meeting of the Great Mechanical Bank in the long waiting period of the meeting, whether it has been time to raise the leadership rate for the first time for almost twelve years.
In the second access to the central bank, the two-wheeled meeting room is an area of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues, will have to put the economic interests of the nation on the other side.
The Congress has reduced the central bank's bilateral liability: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after the great famine, the central bank’s leaders have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This is just the third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision published as a torrent, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision is whether the US economy is ready to be approached by a predictable invitation from the end of 2008 which has been almost permanent for a short period of time .
Although most of the information shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent percentages of the world’s financial markets may have already made the central bank’s officials more stable than ever to increase uncertainty.
"The labour market and inflation are clearly the first and most important things to follow," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a meclarial expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they seek the right to a pre-emption, the increased uncertainty on the world market is sufficient reason to wait," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank is not a compromise, which has already led to a serious setback to the economy.
According to a recent study in Bloomberg, about half of the economic experts predict that the peak will rise this week.
The financial markets also expect the central bank to slow down because, according to the central indicator, there is only about 30 per cent chance of growth.
This refers to the number of securities markets, if the central bank is to rise to a level, otherwise the decision-makers would then succeed by promising that the next rise would not occur in the near future.
As the Dow Jones industrial average index increased by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 percent, with a new figure of 16,599.85.
In line with the expectations of the Central Bank to maintain the level by this week, John Lonski, the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, told the key investors of the group.
"It's amazing if the central bank lifts its tops right now," he says.
If decision-makers raise their heads, "they must see a lot of difficulties in line to support the financial markets so that they don't have to panic."
Other experts argue that the level of recovery would be a source of peace for financial markets, as it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a month later, the central bank had the effect of increasing the rate by 4 per cent in this month, thus taking the first small step towards the slow closure of the financial situation, which would guarantee the stability of the United States's rest.
Yellen has said in the summer and at the beginning that he is expecting a rise this year, despite the fact that liberals require more economic development in his complaint.
Although the creation of new jobs was slow in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped by 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is the figure of the sector by seven years and close to the level that the central bank holds as the limit of full employment.
The growth of the shells has shown signs of rupture.
Although inflation is still below the target of 2 per cent of the central bank for the year, the decision-makers of the Central Bank believe that this is a significant temporary impact on the price of oil dropped.
The result "only of the highest rates and also needs to take into account the difficult situation of the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, the chief economicist of the company Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world declined in the last week when China devastated its currency.
The Dow Jones industry averaged almost 16 percent of its current forecast when investors feared that the slow economy in China would also slow global growth.
Markets have reached some level in this month, and the Dow index is now about 10% below the weighted average.
The capital of the central bank’s decision-makers is an additional element in a multifaceted union, which tells why the level of capital should rise.
"In view of the events of these financial markets and the recent renewal of the economy of China over the past few weeks, the decision-makers would hide the level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and the former central bank officials.
Now he predicts that decision makers are waiting for at least a month to get better treatment.
"The possible effects on the United States economy are still very uncertain, and they do not have enough information in their use what will happen to the consequences of China's events," Oliner says.
The improvement of the international economy is not a major concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not be affected by decision-making.
In practice, however, the Central Bank of the United States has become the world’s financial authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been unplanned.
In 2013, then, President Ben S. Bernanken, regrettably that the central bank could "spend" on the increase in the amount of money, caused distortions on the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies continue to prosper together, central bank officials are expected to look beyond the next development, as well as to consult other central banks and experts in order to better address the global economy.
The Central Bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabel, head of the Investnet Inc global strategy.
President Jeffrey Lacker of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Bank) of Virginia's State of Richmond noted in this month that "the central bank has previously exceeded its financial markets, which have been affected by different economic considerations."
The Federal Open Market Committee on Decisions has called for a rise in the number of votes, and Lacker, a member of the Committee who is a member of the votes cast, for example for 1998-99.
The economic crisis in the area caused the central bank to break down its reference value by 0.75 per cent during a three-day meeting "without its limited, significant effects on the US economy," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank broke these ties.
The Central Bank should establish economic stability for the priority only during the major crisis, as was the collapse of the market in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England’s Central Bank.
The last thing I'm going to do is not get close to that level, Posen's real.
"No one wants a situation where the high level of growth is threatened because the markets are upset," said President Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act (Federal Act) law of the Federal Reserve Act should still contain a double requirement and not mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should predict it.
Is that a great Thai deal?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown
This trade/stock was opened in 1997 and owned by the LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to as thai-Costcona, is a retail sale that also sells to individuals.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not in Thai Town.
The goods/consumption is one stop shop, which offers the latest selection of fresh, packaged and dried benefits, recommended Thai and Asian outdoors, kitchen needs, bedrooms and religious and public holidays.

It's a big deal, and it takes more than an hour to speed up everything that's going on.
If the store gets you hungry, you can eat in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food house (good, bad) found inside the store is close to the boxes, and there are many alternatives.
What's the answer? Do you need anything - anything - from the Thai?
LAX-C probably sells it.
Products have been marketed in a reasonable manner, and most of the products are sold in stock packs.
The products contain Asian specialities and regional wastes, wastes and other products.
The meatatiski is wide, as is the catechism. The staff will definitely clean up and clean the rock and, if necessary, will also look at it for you.

Where it is located: The shop is in the Los Angeles manufacturing area near Chinatown and I'll discuss the facilities - a few maps on the entrance of Philippe The Original.
Location: LAX-C has its own parking area, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although shopping can be fast, the parking lot is usually easy.
Brazil’s Children’s Fund in Rio Grande reports a healthy choice of food for farmers
The Brazilian Children's Fund SPRS has made it possible for women to try to understand the importance of good nutrition during pregnancy by publishing pictures of babies in the womb in the womb, where they have been given descriptions of unhealthful food.
It consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and hydrocarbons that give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Women who are pregnant and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase daily calorie levels by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing the calorie level is not the only food change that a mother should make.
A recent study conducted by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genetic expression and protects babies from developing babies.
Unfortunately, adverse eating conditions were found to have a negative impact on the immune system of the child.
Seven-kanese Sunrise program is popular in the browser, despite the Nine-kanavan companies to update the director's exhibition on Today Show
Karl Stefanovicin and Lisa Wilkinson moved to Canberraan to review the follow-up to the Liberal Party's leadership, failed to increase the visibility of Toda's eyes.
The Nine-Canaan morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull took control of Tony Abbott.
The competitive Sunrise program, known as David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of the weekly series of international broadcasts, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancun.
The minor was not aware of the disturbing Australian TV viewers, since the Sunrise survey was in five state-owned towns of 397 000 when Today was 339 000.
The mean value grew slightly compared to the country (317 000) and the last tens (283 000), but it was still lower than the last tower (333 000).
Soda's been on Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Toda's average was 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
On the other hand, during September, the average Sunrise is 349 000 viewers, while Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting event in the whole world.
The changes in the winds speak this morning as well as in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa can do it, thank you for asking!

The seven-canal great news was the 800-word series, which present the previous Packed to the Raffers series, marked by Erik Thomson, an amazing priority.
A new dramaist, who drew a total of 1,219 million viewers, recently told her about her stepfather, who decided to change the New Zealand border with her two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson's recommended series will be the only force without Raffers' name Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real security.
Seven-year-old The X Factor program was a strong recommendation of 1,136 million, making it easy to win The Block series (838 000) and TBL Family series (726,000).
The Seven Canal was a double trial for The Chase Australia on the second night.
Andrew O'Keefen, the first half of a new summer programme (17-17.30) brought 446 000 viewers to the centre.
The second half-year-old (17.30-18) attended 623 000 viewers - which was enough to win a small victory from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday, The Chase Australia's first half-hour watch was 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour count was at least 720,000.
The average rate of Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night review of the survey carried out to the Nine Canal by believing that the recommended program from Hot Seat will come at the end of the season at 17.30 a.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce McGuire's programme viewers.

Is the final match like a guy who thinks Sam Wood is a perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackya and Snezana Marcoski may have been in trouble to discover who will win The Bachelor's series.
The woman's personality has been held in an extreme secret with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are not really a lipstick who gets the last breath.
However, during our discussions with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Flelows the day before the three came, they could no doubt give a clue about the personality of the winner.
Sam Woodin's voices have been signed before the storm's final.
All three women dropped to the ground when they told how Wood is the perfect man who mentioned his pride, respect, family values and positiveness because of why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last meal is not for you, who should go to it?" they could offer a revelation about who won the son's heart.
Jeavons-Flelows and Marcoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after their own.
Sarah Mackay's and Sam Wood's positions have been undisputed since the first day.
"From the moment I went into the room, (Sarah) the energies and the energies of Sam were almost compatible, and that thought was in my mind all the time," said Jeavons-Flelows.
"Sarah's really beautiful, and it's a pleasure to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel nice and happy together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood agreed very well.
Mackay said that last week's homework got him to realize that Wood could be "that's right."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this would not be just a game - I am now with my whole heart in this," he said.
When asking who Wood should choose if he didn't, Mackay was valuable.
"I don't know what to say," he said.
I like the girls I've been following, so it's a level between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent in midweek at 19.30 a.m. on Ten Canal.
I'm going to say, "Sarah's best option for Sam Wood?"
Jarryd Hayin has many options to start his NFL
Detroit and Seattle were both immediately interested in his changed U.S., and many other groups have asked him about him after his opening day.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team as well as producer Jim Tomsula, and this is a wise decision.
Some of the manufacturers would have left the chance to win the prize in Haiti for a period of time after this conversion of the Australian rugbyli was broken into a ball in the first flight to the team to win the Minnesota ticket number 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and gave Hayin back the next flight and took her with him after the shooting of Reggie Bush.
Tomsul's real nature also appeared in the chat room after the game.
Instead of putting his new results behind him in front of the other group, he would encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in the post-mortem press.
49ersi Specialist Cam Inman reported that Haynea would also encourage the coordinator of the Special Forces, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the falling ball and to worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane that Minnesota Vikings hit on the first flight
This was certainly not the beginning of which Hayne and her numerous Australian fans hoped for a man's NFL-debate.
Hahne was found on a crazy trip from the countryside after a fall, and later he told the Australian radio station to Hamish & Andy 2DayFM channel 104.1 that he would not have been able to imagine a worse start to the NFL.
"Now it was just one of these things, just to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her rape to her 2007 Origin Debyty, when her husband moved to Queensland in her own country.
All of this, however, was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After I played Hayne's poseera in the Instagram style, in a photo with fans in the long Australian flag.

4 died from police attacks against homosexuals in Nepal
Four people, including four-year-old son, died in southern Nepal of the police were killed in a violent group that indicated that the country was thinking of a new constitution proposal, and the authorities reported it on Wednesday.
On Tuesday morning, about 175 miles from the capital of Katmandu, in the region of Rupande.
The chief official of the area, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said that over 1,000 police officers had been gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used gas and then fired air before they were safe from the tsunamis.
Twenty-five police officers and five civilians, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why the species known to be killed, but which were usually used as a less dangerous option, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In the last few weeks of the ongoing violent attacks, the Association has been in different parts of Nepal, where members of the Madhes ethnic group say that the new provinces based on the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group requires its country.
After 10 August, at least 40 people were killed in violent conflicts, 11 of which were police.
Since then, four main parties have signed a contract which has been allocated to the provinces - this is a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal that has been centrally managed over the centuries.
The new Constitution has been designed from 2008 to 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process since the April destruction of the earth by killing thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the draft Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter will be adopted by sunset.

Google starts a donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for the refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) would publish a donation campaign aimed at bringing 11 million dollars to humanitarian organizations that will help Europe's hundreds of thousands of refugees from war zones and poor countries.
Google had a unique personal appearance in its advertising campaign blogs.
Instead of making a statement, the manager, in his own personal experience, also wrote a Google worker, Rita Masoud, who packed my seven-year-old family with Kabulist.
"Let's see a number of dark jungles and bus stops, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was happy.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The solutions are provided by four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations’s Reserve Fund.
Google said that it corresponds to the same amount for each worldwide google.com/refugeereelife offering up to $5.5 million, so that the total value is $11 million.
In Europe there is a bad post-crisis crisis, then a second world war, and for this reason, Syria has basically endured four years of internal strife, which has been more than 4 million people living in their homes this year.
Many also resort to the rounds of war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dizziness can help mildly cross-plasm diabetes
According to the new study, the benefit of type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too long to say that these mildly passing diabetics live longer than those treated in other ways than in surgery.
"The acquisition of mortality data will take a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He's a marketing expert who wrote a new study on JAMA Surgery's time magazine.
Dilution, i.e. baratric cuts, uses a variety of methods to reduce the total balance.
They reduce hunger and limit food poisoning.
Over the years barriers have been more effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have been treated with disease, and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the duration of the stress, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it reveals that someone is superior, and if the BMI is over 30, he is considered to be a mobile carrier.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected from 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric break, the construction of the floor and the reduction of the floor, in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly mobile.
The study showed that the average number of persons played by BMI decreased from 31.5 to the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those treated in other ways as a result of surgery remained at the same time as BMI in 29th century.
36% of patients treated with diabetes have improved overall and 28% have been treated partially.
As a result of comparison, only 1% of diabetes in the drug-treated group improved completely and approximately 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "pure" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the gambling group", the writers acknowledged.
Researchers also observed haemoglobin levels A1c, which reveal blood sugar levels over a long period of time.
Haemoglobin A1c should be maintained in less than 7% of patients.
The haemoglobin of A1c decreased by approximately 9% after the injection to approximately 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable by about 8%.
This "glymetic control" that has improved haemoglobin levels A1c, however, has not reduced mortality over five years, says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu to colleagues.
The study group also compared averages between two different types of cutting.
In the fifth year when compared to the low-life group in the lower-life group, the lower weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowering its weight index (7.4 and 5.1), lowering the haemoglobin level A1c (3.1% and 2.1%), and possibly achieving a more complete diabetes resuscitation (46.9% and 16.7%).
University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoinix Blackstone says that although the study does not appear to be viable or boring after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where gambling has led to a longer life with more people.
In the Swedish study, 29 per cent of the incidence of deaths in traffic accidents was found to be lower than in 15 years when compared with a group that had experienced the most traditional treatment.
Although a new study does not appear to improve the survival of fungi, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging to people with BMI below 35 who are interested in gambling.
"Research results are crucial just because they show that the delay is safe for a lower pressure index group," he says, not to mention the risk of death or renal disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take very serious weight at the time of BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has caused these genetic changes that are constantly preparing his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"All can't come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot take all refugees in addition to the fact that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tiibat's Buddhism has called for the end of violence in refugee homes.
Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in its opening address, which he held in Oxford at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in the open ten-day visit to Britain. The centre is dedicated to ethical research.
Dalai Lama said that, in the present situation, the needs of all humanity should be put on hold to individual nations or even countries.
He also stressed that while the response to the refugee crisis in Western Europe must be surprising, it is also insufficient.
"Not all can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama has been the most active in the crisis in Germany and Italy, he stressed that there is only temporary solution.
"I am surprised to see a number of thousands of refugees, but there is a need to consider long-term solutions: how these Muslims can bring true peace and real development, almost through education.
The first thing is to think about how we can reduce killing on their land.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
Taking the view of the question of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States resulted in two border events.
"After 9/11, I wrote in my letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it read unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the number of child handicrafts has increased to four times.
For children under 12 years of age after 2010, almost 400 per cent of the United States has reported a strong increase in the consumption of alcoholic beverages.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopezi, the number of cases of defining drugs reported in the case of children under 12 years of age increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in the case of children under the age of 12.
"Children are more and more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them is due to the ageing policy," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children are eating disinfectants for the purpose of doing it while others want to affect their friends or respond to a challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where tennis ageers use desinfiencing to get a bad growth rate.
According to the report, the products have been collected from the disinfectant into an alcoholic tube to make a stronger drink.
The effects of desinficinating substances may affect younger children.
"You don't think this is bad for him," said Lopez.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are those with added effect.
There are manicure, wine and apple juices that are very attractive to children's minds.
The disinfectant may contain alcohol from any 45 to 95 %.
In particular, small children need only a few injections.
"It's really alcohol-induced," the director of the hospital's medical care department, Stephen Thornton, told Fox 4: to Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey to your bed, but the handicrafts are left visible, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijal is six years old, and she was taken to the hospital to care for only four cancers of menacing hands in school.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of the age race contract, told enespopolitan physician Chris Ritchey, who took care of the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
And when he spoke to her, she couldn't walk when she reached the end of the day.
Doctors followed him at night over a different hospital for possible brain damage, because alcohol got the girl to lose her head and cut her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," his mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been to kill my child.
Finally, it has been recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and transfer desinfiction substances from children.
In addition to the alcohol business, some disinfectants have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two Australian women died of an oral deinfinating substance that contained toxic, unannounced substance.
The health authorities believe that the product contained ethanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which has been reported to be an active substance.
In January, in the northern part of New York City, three quarters of the four-year-olds were planning to smoke their "all" teacher by spreading bacteria into the classroom, reported in the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant and refused to classify it.
The police must prevent the plan from being "sustained" and leave corruption to the schools.
Huhumylly: Celtic does not have discrimination
Griffiths tend to talk less about Celtic disputes, and Deila admits that Hopes is in a firm place, but she gets it to turn it.
Hearts fight Scotland's football league against Neilson's crimes, and Warburton is on guard against the colors of January, which can disrupt the unity of the group.
Dons grew up leading to Celtici's reference point
Adam Rooney, the first half of the punishment, took Aberdeen's head to victory at Hamilton's Pitttodrien Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to raise the difference to the point of Celtici's reference.
Griffiths reduces speech of disputes
Celtic's internal disputes have resulted in complaints, but Griffiths has ended them immediately. He claims that he and his team members have no sense of working better under the eye when the group is preparing to meet the leader of the Netherlands.
I think we're not under stress, I think the players are waiting for a hit.
The lack of the master of the Scots is discouraging the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers middle player and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer said Dutch footballers have lost their interest in Celtici because there is no competition with the mastership with Rangers.
Ajax's current envoy de Boer said, "The Netherlands no longer shows the places of Celtic games, and why?"
Because Rangers isn't involved.
People here don't just talk about Rangers' request.
They're talking about old firm groups.
They're talking about both groups together, and they're interested in that.
There are a lot of excitement in these groups, and others like Scots want to follow them.
Deila complains about the changing situation
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian bomb is in the process of turning around.
The destruction of Malmøl, and the result of the defeat of the Masters, quickly followed the destruction of ten men in fear of Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series of five points in the next chapter.
But Deila said, "Celtics have had bad sections before, and we're going to get up again."
Now we just want to get rid of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is devastating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what's going on.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton's equipment from January to January
Although only a few weeks later, Mark Warburton made a comment on possible January players' transfers, he is careful to ensure that he does not want to combine the team's uniformity.
Previously on Brentford's boss said, "The winter shift window is very different from the one in the middle window."
In the case of the players in the middle, there is a time to adapt to what we see in our team this way.
The group's really good.
Sometimes increasing the number of unwanted players can make it more difficult.
Celtic’s interesting point of view on the origin of life
Swanse attacks on Michu, whose name has been connected to the transfer window in Celtici, have regretted that he can remain married after his contract with Swans has been concluded.
A 29-year-old player has had a two-year-old gambling habit, and he hasn't been able to find a new follow-up from Wales in the middle of the year.
Hearts are ready to fight Scotland's football league because of Nelson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was removed from the field, and the group then lost 3-2 of the defendant's red card was burned later, and this was the last eight months already three Collum's court red card that was burned.
Neilson keeps saying, "I did not question the truth, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths acts as a protection against Tynecastle
A faithful Hiberian player had to be thrilled to receive a beautiful song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skace.
The event took place in the village of Edinburgh in Roseburni, prior to Edinburgh’s Derby Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"There was a derby in this and it was a moment of opinion," the attacker added, "it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastl until then to play Celtici."
Tannadic government believes Dundee United Leader - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United Government still has faith in the ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the failure of players has to end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes' happy "winning" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was inseparably involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but he succeeded because of the first half of Adam Rooney's punishment, to achieve his seven-fold surplus, which led them to the top of the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, "There's no group that's won anything, then it was a poker or too much that wouldn't have won games in this way."
The unemployment of Scottish people remains the same as the growth of the whole of Britain in the Iso-British
IN Scotland, 164,000 persons remained between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Britain increased by 10 000 in total to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in Britain than 5.5 per cent, the figures of the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
At the same time unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a period of three months, and the number of employees is now 2,612 000.
Scotland's employment rate decreased by 74 per cent during the annual year, which is higher than the average of the United Kingdom of Great Britain by 73.5%.
Secretary of State of Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latter: "The long-term plan of the Government is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been a very close year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Isoa-Britania.
During these 12 months, Scotland's labour market has improved, employment has grown and unemployment has decreased.
Why I Witnessed in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I'll see you later today when a man is executed.
If so, and I hope not, I will sit in the audience's papers at Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison when Richard Glossip is executed on a death row.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses who died.
I answered my request in January through his best friend, and even though I was upset, I agreed.
I've started to hide this day close to it.
So why did I agree?
I was surprised because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique view.
Operators are also able to monitor investments in the United States, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through the price to be paid.
The oclahoma has reduced the storage space for the media from two years to five years.
Whoever's ever chosen, he's gonna see it happen.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also created my own contact with him through the monthly calls and one two and a half-hour visits.
I like a man.
We laugh often in our conversations.
The prison authorities say that I can't be both a witness and a supplier, so I can't have my memoranda and can't see my face.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One academic minister accused on Twitter that I had confirmed my innocence.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner the story by the way he wants you to get involved.
I chose the supplier.
He admitted that "would have been better able to say what he said," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip was different from some of my relatives and my writing about things.
He won't tell me what I'm going to write, and I wouldn't do that if he said.
I've told him that he can take me away from the witness for any reason.
But he wants us to have an international supplier who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help him to deal with the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my series of podcasts.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is guilty.
After Barry Van Treese's murder, his actions would have taken him in any case to the criminal aid.
But I think it's a very strong possibility that he hasn't committed murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong for him to do it.
And then this is the look I'm looking at her dying.
I can't claim to be completely half-life.
There must be other suppliers who care about it.
You can tell me what it feels like to see when the man I love is dying in vain.
The man was kidnapped after the Canning River police officer
Canning Valen's sticker stayed in the dark when he pulled a man out of Canning River.
A man from Perth's home, trying to chase the police away from the police on his way to the village when he found himself on the beach, from another water just a meter away from a policeman who tried to "swift him gently back to the beach".
The Canning Valen police were called silent because of the illegal arrest of Beckenham.
When they found out that they were suspicious, this was trying to get them to the Canning River hole.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water saying, 'I'm not going to go out, come get me,' said former superstar Snartl Castledine.
Constapell Lachlan Perahac did not want to break his uniform, so he used a safer tactic: "police negotiations".
"Sometime people do bad things while trying to escape," said the former superstar Castledine.
Ben Cousins, a master pilot, is an excellent example.
In 2006, Cousins stopped his car to avoid a complaint and tried to get over Swan River.
He didn't succeed in his business, but he inspired locals to start planning a game plan for the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody accuses the authorities of trying to force him and threatens to stop the competition
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victors have tried to force a firm for his debts over the past year and threaten to stop the competition immediately.
He blames the authorities and the Racing Victoria charity, claiming that they have a personal campaign to launch against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tat's delay in dismissing the treatment on Friday was the last one.
Moody told Fairfax Medial that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition and that he has had to deal with the situation after Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt.
He's been in the wrong language for years for the defense of insurance claims, and he didn't want it to look like a disaster.
"I didn't mean to say anything about this, and I've been quite quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it hurts so much that everything breaks up once," Moody said.
They knew your situation was going on.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today, and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk my head and I want my owners to think I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they start thinking about each other, I don't want to go on as a cook anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm doing to my license.
Earlier Moody wrote a bomb racing.com on the questionnaire, where he said that the charity department had tried hard on his team.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man, asking him about his name, and offering him a job with my toys, if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a hero.
If that's the case, they'd really like to separate their agents, because they've failed in my arrest.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear about that and are clear today.
Should I start thinking that this is coming from a personal point of view?
Did Victoria Racing finally decide to be a man and perhaps to transfer responsibility to others than the promulgators for what's going on in the area?
Am I in a dangerous area?
Am I in such a bad situation?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and work for me, and I'm not even sure if I can't think about it right now.
But now I'm in that point, I don't care anymore, and it's gonna kill me.
It's really killing me.
I urge them to make a decision that is up to them.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my eyes into this.
The producer’s market growth has increased long after Lidar’s cobalt research, and the delay in dismissing him has led him to conclude that he could "remove his license."
Moody, who is well aware of Master Black Caviar's excellent preparation, has called for the rule of day-to-day treatment after the hair or hair skin has been placed on horses' legs, which is against the rules.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees put it on his feet in a fight.
It could have been a funeral last night.
It could have been it yesterday, just like it was.
That's what it was on Saturday.
Moody may have a three-month competition dispute due to the health care of the day in which the operators initiated the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Consistency of the carrier responsible for transport in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic accident to be beaten in Cobram during the weekend.
The driver was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital when he got serious injuries when the car broke down at his Murray Valley government on Monday morning.
The police told him that the driver was away and that he didn't stop trying to help the driver.
A 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of leaving uninterrupted in the event of an accident, of neglect of aid, and of other business meetings.
The driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobrami, is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team manufacturer Craig Bellamy attacks competitors on pressure equipment
Melbourne Storm, founder Craig Bellamy, has also criticized two claims by the NRL-rugbyli's metarosis that his team's calls would be part of the "crowd".
Sydney Roosters, governor Trent Robinson, said that the unique salinium of Storm's "pinia" on his own, when it miraculously won the final victory in Sydney on the family line.
Brisbane Broncos, the governor Wayne Bennett, was surprised to see his visit to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals of the day. Bennett called the game "showcase" and said that two Queensland teams were not "very excited" by the pressure.
Bellamy shared his group's calls and said they're just focusing on "contacts."
Bellamy added that his confidence added two leading preparatory criticisms to Storm, which meant that they were afraid of his losing team.
"This is always going to be a conversation - I didn't hear about the pressure on Trent Robinson when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said in the middle of the week.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or in our technology all year round, and in the last six weeks, we have just stressed contacts in the courts, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been in a group for three years, and he's obviously got a great team prepared, so he's probably not used to disappear, and then this was a little confusion to him.
It's funny how this is always going to talk about this year.
Bellamy challenged Bennet's idea of "freaking rugby" by reminding me of the fact that Bennet's famous St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010.
Wayne's talking about a exciting ragby.
He thought it was important to compare the singing-heavens to our family games and tell how exciting their games were," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a quiet group, and Wayne said he couldn't concentrate less.
But now he has a team that can play the rumbles that we like to be excited, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play a game like that when you have a guy like that.
He brought in half of it in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his happy rugbyy - not each group has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
I think it's more reliable when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks later, they probably didn't think of us as answering important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Rooster was more pistier than the play between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game must have been a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more medals, but is it a exciting ruby?
Or would it be a heartbreaking breach of the defense line and the absence of the day?
This is about the lines.
If they mention us, it means that sometimes we can play against them.
Storm has been released this week because they have already won the right of the family either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronilla Sharkses against the first of the sun-days in the AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold first on Tuesday.
200 000 dollars for the Serbian man of fraud
A man who threatens the possible life-threatening capacity of 40 cocaine kilograms in Queensland has been released against the cost of 200 000 dollars.
At the age of 29, Marco Maximovic was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police had followed 100 kilos of garbage for the Solay driver who came to South America through the U.S.A. and landed in Coomeraan in August.
Maximovic was found at the meeting of the other accused during the entire night, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximovicia threatens the possible life-threatening business of the cocaine company, her lawyers claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to keep the whole volume in his mouth and that he could be completely addicted to coffee.
The Supreme Court of Justice, Peter Flanaga, was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong contacts with Serbia.
She travels to Serbia several times," she told the judge in the middle of the week.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maximovic lied to the police from where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and father together had offered 200 000 dollars to ensure her release.
"The overwhelming evidence from both persons is clear that setting a $200,000 loan is a real economic burden for them," said Dr. Flanaga.
But it was not enough to prevent him from being declared innocent in front of justice, he warned.
The maximum amount was granted, provided that he and his passport between Australia and Serbia are notified to the police every day and is held by his foreign language in the evening and in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
Pedofil used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of the child’s approval.
Stevan Hogg took the girl to bed and then wrote her a Web-based service, where Hogg received numerous unsolicited pictures of children sent to her by another user.
The girl got up later, found that the phone was missing and found it sleeping at Hoggin's hands.
The girl studied the phone and found satisfying messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police came, they saw five pictures, studied the computers on the site, and found "careful" Web sites that had been used to locate children's innocent images.
After that, Hogg said to the police that he had made this "fucking pedophile" on the Internet before he "sends his police to scare them."
Fiscal spokesman Eilh Robertson told Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that there is an adjection - that he is dependent on the fear of human beings.
He admitted that he had made a hideout on the computer, but he said that they had been done just because he wanted to make a police officer so that he could keep the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent pictures to him, and when Hogg asked the person to send more pictures.
Hogg said he did this just for food.
He said he's gonna get out of the hospital and want to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she cried to her mother, her sister, and she cried.
My mother saw uncanny pictures on the phone, and then you met the defendant.
The girl was questioned, and she said that she had been charged with using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed younger to her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted his guilt for preparing or taking pictures of innocent children on 14 June last year. He failed to see this year on 25 January and left the court proceedings on 24 March of this year.
Advocate-General Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia should not be interested in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that he was not a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal ruled in October in order to have time for the social action to prepare the reports.
In this case, Hoggy was given the benefits, but in other cases he has been detained before treatment.
He was added to the sexual record before the day of judgment.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe was wrong to Parliament
An elderly African leader, Mugabe, died earlier this year on the street leading to the conversation.
He didn't get hurt, but the video described in the video was published by the law of the virus in the social media.
Parliament's openings also wanted opposition legislators to claim that they had been sent with anonymous killings, which warned them of Mugabel's being beaten during his speech.
In the last month, they built and stopped him in the middle of the morning while he was holding a talk on the state of the country to Parliament - which he said again as a poet.
Innocent Gonese, director of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that the seven opposition policies received text messages on their way to warn them that they were disturbed by Mugabe’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the search for the message is 'slow'," Gonese told the suppliers after Mugaben spoke.
The communication warned the members concerned that the inconsistencies would end in Parliament and that when they stood outside, the inconsistencies in Parliament would not be valid.
The Group's supervisors said that the side of Morgan Tsvangari's leadership is "careful" threats to its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has saved 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its reorganisation and cost-effective efforts in the business service.
Later this year, HP distributes two prosthetics to the company, separating its computer and output business activities from rapidly growing business equipment and services.
The expected job losses amount to about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said the HP report.
"These reorganisations enable the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise to be more competitive and sustainable," said Meg Whitman, president of HP, and the delivery director, who leads the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise must be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we must have a boy and a hearty choice of services that help businesses move into a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual business exchange will be over $50 billion, and it will "focus on producing the best integrated technology solutions for companies" will be reported in company information.
How to destroy a company that was manufactured by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard at Stanford University University in the 1930s. The company works in a car located in Palo Alto, called "Pilaxon Place of Birth".
HP has gone through a great reorganization to find out the transition from traditional computer to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is in the last phase, which is based on the belief that strictly limited companies are doing better.
Captain Arsenal Michael Arta says the team members must support their commitment to Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb scale
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshir that now is the opposite of September and that, assuming that he's in touch with his plans, there's no reason why he wouldn't be playing again until December.
In this best case, Wilshire will remain among at least four of England's next games, and taking into account his experience, it is uncertain whether he will be involved in the first time in Europe's maritime affairs.
The biggest problem in this recent problem is that the end of Wilshire last time was strong after a more delicate individual, and he reminded the old man that he needed to get away before the beginning of the road.
"It's not a threat to the wind," Wenger said.
It's a creature that didn't improve properly.
It's nothing funny.
That was just an accident.
It doesn't depend on his noses or his brains what he's had.
This may take place from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger acknowledged, while trying to get back through the middle of the game, there is always a risk of more.
There is also an inconsistencies in the structure.
Premier Injuries Ltd's research shows that Wilshere had 23 different tumors after she was debating six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he played 157 extra games in just 65 games.
In view of Arsenal’s broader overallity after 2007-08, by six months it had been the second of the Valioligan groups that had lost most of the day because of the worst.
Wenger offers the chance of the storm, but Arsenal believes that their final improvement will continue to be in the garbage dump.
"Sometime when you get back from work can be a long time, when you have to strengthen your body and win competition," Wenger said.
Jack's a young man enough to get over it.
I hope her body is stable, I'm sure she's going to do it, and she's gonna be able to make her as much as she deserves.
Wenger is ready to round up his team when Arsenal begins playing in the Mesterian game on Wednesdays against Dinamo Zagreb and then playing on Thursdays against Chelsea and the first Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspura.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably starting.
Wenger can also place Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to hold on to balance and give it up to the favorite players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear path to the F-class, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is the most feared of Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 jobs since they produced their "Infinity" campaign recently.
The stadium was followed by an earthquake, which was a force of 3.2 at Richter's asterisk.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has recently learned that he has been given too much of the Masters against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a long wish to lead a group to its first European Cup win.
"This motivation is great," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, we were realistic.
We're very proud, but we're not jealous.
FriendsFest: a comedian who taught us serious things about men's friendship
It is obvious that similar descriptions are not in the registers, especially when it is taken into account that men’s need for openness is more ineffective than ever before, and that young men’s suicide rates are higher than those in the last five years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest death in 20-45s in Britain, and it is three times more common than in women.
In the company dealing with the problem, Campaign Again Living Miserably (CALM) reported for the year 2015. The aim was to attack a culture that prevents men from applying for help when needed.
Friendship is at the forefront of this challenge.
In a recent study, more than 2,000 high school and school-age students were exposed to manoeuvres. According to the study, the potential of a person was doubled if a sufficient percentage of his friends were "healthful".
Even those who were not tired were left with the possibility of exposing possible mental health problems if they enjoyed healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
Through this social media, the style of communication goes to the end of the content, and the immediate response is often more important than important contact.
Our digital life has been doubled to the need to have a strong, happy, and successful effect, even though it really is a specialty.
This global success is governed by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this happens at the cost of personal growth and friendship, which affects our mental health.
And as a billion-year-old video player explained against it, the money really doesn't get more happiness.
Freddie's beauty was just that it turned to the top of this focus.
No lie has been defined in their work but, above all, their personality, which is clearly separated from their friends.
Joey and Chandler's many desires, moments of pleasure in the future looking at a football field, Ross's sadest Rachela - their nightmares came from knowing that yes, men can match all of this, even though they often hesitate to investigate their feelings completely.
As the volunteer workers of the Samaritan organization explained to me, "I hear people who are tired and selfish, I really understand how little interaction with a friend can improve the situation."
Often, men who contact us experience that they can't talk to their friends.
The old idea of "equipment" is strong, just as you know that if you open up a problem, you're going to see a failure.
Friends are one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term solutions.
That's where men's friendship grew a little bit.
Despite the fact that I am in the second position to help people at an unexpected time, long - term support comes from close, personal, family and friends network.
And then, if you took part in Comedy Central FriendsFestin this weekend, and all the painting places are redesigned as the honor of the party, why did you take your friends to Central Perki?
Or something better if you see someone in Starbucks alone, warm and healthy.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central at the end, all 236 sections, participated in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes the map and helps PSG get past Malmö's page
Angel Di Maria announced with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan, the country against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made a world over the Masters' Debt to help PSG end up as Malmö's aunt.
I'm going to get a report and react to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain began playing the Mesterian game at the end of the 2-0 battle against Malmö against Parc des Princes.
Di Maria made a four-minute tour of the Mestars at the debatation of the world under four minutes, but the team seized many opportunities before they finally increased their success in the ancient Cavan day at 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shahhtar Donetskin, needed a strong start against the Swedish league, because the game was not only a place to go on, but also an improvement to their four finals in their last three rounds.
But even though PSG takes the points, there was no classic copy, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic broke the place before and later was replaced by the village. Malmö is his old village team and it is the group where he started to destroy his urine in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or guests, so 2-0 will produce problems for the opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things that we're going to do this far little," Blanc said.
This is supposed to be good.
We wanted to win and win, even though unfortunately we didn't succeed in making one or two more ways.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team three changes after the group left Ligue 1 in the village of Bordeaux on Sunday, but he stayed for a quarter of a minute at Di Maria's funeral.
When he moved from Manchester United in the last month, an Argentina-Araginian hostage was named a man who took PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why he was driving Marco Verratt's food back to Malmö's defense line and then after the beautiful last instance of Johann Wilden's end to the network.
However, if someone expected PSG to be easy and successful, he had to be ashamed.
Malmö was a successful opponent, and it won the Celtic solution to save this level, with nine international players and five players and two players at the heart of the game.
But the team did not offer the attack on the side of the attack at least another 34 minutes after Nikola Djurdjic's robbery, which took the knife off Kevin Trapp's lap.
Instead, the PSG had to be between a lot of broken food and the last one, especially because of Ibrahimavicil, who failed in all five companies only by the first half and then failed when Cavan put a ball into Ibrahimavic's relationship immediately at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in his presentation to his colleagues, and just from the food of Ibrahimavic Di Maria, he sent a tour of the village, which was named after the village of Wiland in about 52 minutes.
Another land was finally obtained after an hour’s game due to a six-year-old Russian Cavan after Ibrahimovic had appeared on the left side of Maxwell’s cross-section.
It ended with Malmö's hopes of getting back to the game, and only the great fight by Wildan from the direct assault by David Luiz took the final numbers below before the replacements came from Ezequiel Lavez's country was rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö's maker Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was one level higher than his team. The Norwegian said, "The last time we played too many Masters was last December."
After that, we've only played in Sweden, which is not the same level.
I don't know. I don't know.
I'll take it to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The Swedish mining sector left Glencore, who suffered from the price loss of basic commodities, spending $2.5 billion a week on the sale of shares as part of its extensive debt plan.
Glencore, who is listed in the London Press, reported that it had sold new shares for about 1.6 billion dollars in order to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is fighting at the prices of raw materials, when the slowdown in China's economy causes demand and destruction on all markets.
A new mark on Glencore's shares took place in the midweek morning shop in London.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131.60 pens in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore had been exposed last week as part of a larger share of $2.5 billion in its plan to spend $30 billion on its debt to about a third.
The company sold a new share of 125 pens, which meant 2.4 per cent of the discount to a certain decision price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, which totaled 9.99 per cent of the company.
Concerns about the long-standing rise in the Chinese growth have increased by more than half and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other useful products have decreased by 20-40 per cent.
White House to confirm Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China's President Xi Jinping makes a statement to the United States by the end of the month in which the White House was published in the German press.
The first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is in response to President Barack Obaman's last November visit to Beijing, the opinion was said.
In the United States, President-in-Office and Vice-President Michelle Obama will arrange for Xi and this side to Peng Liyuan tonight after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"Principal Xin visits will allow us to extend cooperation between the United States and China in a number of ways to benefit from joint global, regional and bilateral affairs, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xille the opportunity to discuss constructively the issues with which there are differences," added the resolution.
In the summer, which was first published in February, Xin is also expected to be away on a trip to Washington, D.C., to meet a number of U.S. technology leaders prior to his visit to the New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obaman and Xin are expected to discuss a number of critical issues, including the concern of China's alleged web site and the country's growing unpredictability in the Pacific waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces the difference in the film
Matt Damon joined an African actor with Effie Brown in their discussion of the difference that Damon doesn't need behind the scenes.
In HBO's South-East Project Greenlight, a sample in the Greenlight section of the HBO, Brown highlighted the need for different views on what will happen to the dark head of the selected project.
"When we talk about the difference, it will be taken into account when selecting samplers in the film, not listed," Damon said.
The following Brown reacted in an infamous manner, comments "Oh! Wow. Okay," while the comments of The Martinian's exhibitors remained in the air.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers, joined Damon and Brown in a discussion on the finals of the series.
"I want to invite people to think about who any leader is then how they deal with Harmony's personality," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark smell is the noise that his white partner is wearing.
The Dear White People's producer demanded the film's rights to the finals of Leo Angelos and Kristen Branccio; Damon strongly said that their leadership "would end up giving us something we don't want."
When the debate was launched, the social media broke down Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his attitude about the film industry by writing: "Matt Damon speaks only of a dark person and explaining to him the difference is NIIN VALKOIST."
After its publication, the questionnaire collected more than 5000 reconnaissances and 4000 copies of the questionnaire.
Damon's comments are part of a period in which the precise presentation in the media is forwarding the social debate.
After the white police killed ten-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter company was deployed underground and urged legislators and authorities to stop the use of colourful people.
In January, the singer Prince referred to the movement at the presentation of the Year's album as the recipient of the Grammy Award.
"Albums still have meaning," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement will soon issue an opinion to answer the Fox News TV series Elizabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
On the contrary, it was said that Damon is involved in a group of terrorists, producers and mediamologists who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the East.
It's not clear whether he's accepted the invitation or he's already met the father.
First American Ninja Warrior Cruise
A professional football player and actor Isaac Caldiero became the first player on earth the day he won the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a million-dollar prize.
As far as the seven long-term competition programme is concerned, there has never been a competitor, who would have explained all the aspects of the programme's esterament.
In the last section of the series of two men, Caldiero and cameramen Geoff Britten, they will find the last round.
The last task was to speed up about 23-metres of poverty in 30 seconds.
The first time the British raced and solved the challenge, which led to him the first player of all times, who discovered part 4 of the American Ninja Warrior’s rejuvenation. But Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds earlier, which he did with his winner.
Caldiero gave an answer to E!News after a difficult victory and was still shocked about winning a million dollars prize.
"Then this is a great idea when I've never been pregnant or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his father's payoff.
Or so suddenly... I can even imagine what the future of this is... the future is unknown.
The rapporteur, Kent Weed, sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter fine and why Britten gets more payouts, although he is the first of all the time competitors who have succeeded in crossing the line.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money will get what they have soon," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and a change in life, it is a feeling of great satisfaction.
I don't think she feels beautiful because of that.
He's just so happy that he's been able to do what he did.
His fan's been over her.
He's a great guy and a decent family.
He's the father of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone was going to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone differently.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eight-way, which begins in summer 2016.
Detroit Tigers Hipi Minnesota Twins
MINEAPOLIS -- The other side of the road has not been too happy for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers once had some of the best baseball groups, but now he's the last American League Central division.
Tigers showed the role of the player as a complete poet when it won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins decided to raise the possibility of playing the head of Houston Astros in competition from another American League villa.
The Detroit game had at least one winter time been devoted to a six - story H pair, which had been very difficult to reach most of the next half of the year.
"All the winnings are fun, regardless of how to get them," said team leader Brad Ausmus.
The tigers, Alfredo Simon, continued his early attack when Detroit made the trip three times in the first two days, and then in the sixth and then in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) ate 6 1/3 of the day and saved three trips.
This was against his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending this year," said Simon.
It's hard for a changeman to eat every game, and that's why I want to go to a hearty game.
Victor Martinez's seats were three times and two times as likely as his first rounds after half-life.
This was Martinez's first three rounds the night after he hit Seattle on July 6th.
"He's got a good smile," said Ausmus.
He seemed good (in painting), looked much better in painting and continued playing the same model.
The Twins were three years after the seventh anniversary, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
St. Byron Buxton started at the top of the platform two steps out on the left side of the road.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks went home on one of his tracks, and Simon got burned directly to the other player, Brian Dozier, before Simon was switched to the left side of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy was running Maurea, the only anti-sustainment player in front of the leading deputy, Miguel Sanao, who would break the two to the left of the right-hand Drew VerHagen.
With two wheels on the side of the valley and a balanced wheel, VerHagen received a three-speed Trevor Plouffen to hit the ground leading to the toppleline.
In this case there was a predictor: 27 times this way, when Plouffe found a doppelganger.
After Detroit had been appointed at the start of the nine-year security department, Mauer had two short-term run against the prisoners of Tigers against Bruce Rondonia, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the real player burned Sano's three meals at five in the rescue.
Detroit used to accept Phil Hughes at first.
Tiggers received three courses in the first two days against the right vet player, who got away from the list of winnings before the game was removed for more than a month due to the event.
"I obviously didn't want to start with this," Hughes said, "but before I was in the game, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I had been made on the third day by a few nice dishes."
After Hughes hit the first ball on the first ball, he gave the second player Ian Kinsler a step forward.
In the case of J.D. Martinez, J.D. Martinez led to Victor Martinez, who took himself to the middle class and led to the first phase of the game.
Victor Martinez would cut off his 0-21-pubbles in good driving conditions.
Third-party player Nick Castellanos went on to the right and caused another run, but his dangerous situation ended when Victor Martinez refused to move on to the third-party.
Tiggers continued on the second floor and got one floor, two floors in the condition of James McCann, and two floors in the one floor in the center of the hall, Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important lie," said Chief of Twins, Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very good at it, but it flew right.
Hughes began to be on the food chain and ate a three-year-old, after which his position became the right successor of A.J. Atter.
Hughes was counted three blocks from the sixth floor, and he was walking on four floors.
HUOMIOIT: The right-wing tigers Anibal Sanchez had to be removed because of a fall.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews, who beat Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of missing persons from the mid-August event due to a seizure, but he was supposed to be back in the middle of the week.
On Sanchez's way out, the left-hand foodman Daniel Norris is going to start off the list of skimmings against Twins.
Norris's statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in the fourth round following the conversion of the left-hand poet David Price on 30 July.
Norris has been outside since 20 August due to the outbreak of the osteoporosis of the wine.
The series of Tigers and Twins' three games ends in midweek at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is placed on the right side of Minnesota against Ervin Santanaa (5-4, 4.33 ERA).
Xi urges us to open up the wider economy to the world
President Xi Jinping, who is responsible for leading the reform, said that the budget should be extended to the outside world to promote growth.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group on the Strengthening of the General Assembly.
The promotion of transparency is at the same time as reforms are being put forward to increase new trade and livelihoods, as well as to create new conditions for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines which included a restrictive list of market access, the finding of border inspection posts, the inviting of state-owned companies to private capital, and the revision of the housing registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list is set up, naming the sectors and enterprises that cannot be invested.
The system will be tested gradually and improved using test programmes.
The change must be significant, as it gives market players a greater role in the focusing of resources, ensures the business environment based on law and makes the market more open, in the opinion it is stated.
The government will also find its government, which it distributes to companies, making sure that companies decide how to handle their business.
The resolution also said that China should be allowed to explore new models of economic cooperation beyond borders and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open up government sectors to private donors, more areas will be open.
"The government will not change its line with foreign investment, and it will protect the legal interests of foreign finance companies and provide them with better services," the opinion said.
In addition, the search process for permanent residence permits, green cardies, will be facilitated by optimisation of requirements and by facilitating the search process.
The meeting also discussed the protection of the rights of law enforcement and the support of professional authorities and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders, Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in the post-convenient opinion.
