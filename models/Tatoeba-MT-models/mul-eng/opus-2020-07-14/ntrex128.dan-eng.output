Politicians in Wales afraid of "likes"
There was confusion among some members of the Welsh National Assembly about a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It is based on plans to amend the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (the Welsh Parliament).
AMs from the whole political spectrum are concerned that the change in name could lead to lateralisation.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was worried because "it smells on Twp and Pwp".
For readers without Wales: In Welsh, twp means the ball, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Walisian conservative said his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter you are addressed in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up a legislative proposal for the introduction of the amendments, said: "The final decision on the names which Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, where there was a broad reference to calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Wells Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (valisic Members) or the WMPs, but the MWP option was largely reflected in a public consultation.
The Am's offer of seemingly alternative options, but the struggle to achieve agreement can be difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to compile a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on the reforms contains other changes in the way in which the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs are finally voting on what they should be called when the legislative proposal is discussed.
Macedonians vote on the change in the name of the country
The voters vote Sunday on whether their country's name is to be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a long-term conflict with neighboring Greece, which has their own province on behalf of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbours' names constitute a requirement on the territory of Greece and have long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjerge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he wants to sign the vote.
Subjects of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is only a price paid to be a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's are standing while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I've talked to said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are no parts."
He said it's understandable that the kids disappear.
"People socialize in other ways today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the day-to-days of the quarter, where people go on a daily basis."
In relation to the churches, he is concerned that the money intended to sell assets does not last long, and that “before or later they are back where they started”.
He adds that the church could be replaced by apartments filled with the kind of people who do not help the rest of the holiday.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property opportunities in these buildings is white," he says, "and it is also devoted to the development where these churches are finally completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the estates will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a sort of metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a quarter later.
The original methodology moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked closely took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who was standing in front of a shop of stores on 125th Street, one of the main shopping dogs in Harlem, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but when Johnson’s son - in - law planned to restore the building, they ordered the clock.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and successor in St. Martin's, called the "the clocks of the poor."
The expert who played at the clock game in June called it something else: "A cultural drama" and "an irrevocable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first time in the world that was played by a sort of musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest time game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been played in St. Martin's last few months has been a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of whom were captured by church leaders, others of the bishops.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, the Head of the Council of the Council, consisting of leading doctors, wrote to the Bishop of the Bishop about the concern that the Bishop would "try to lower the expenses" to the Council of the Congregation, even though the Council of the Congregation had not been involved in appointing the architects and contractors who were sent by the Bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the Bishop.
Haj hurts 13-year-old in darkness after hummers in California
A horse attacked and injured on Saturday a 13-year-old boy, when he drowned in California on the first day of the summer season, says officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had covered with friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then with a group ran over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just a surprise that he had caught a hammer, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I was praying!
I was praying!"
"All his demands were reviewed," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone would come out of the water, 'There's a horse in the water!' added Hammel.
The drink was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was notified in critical terms.
It's not clear what kind of haj was attacked.
The librarian Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a horse in the area had been seen a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Gilles added that the victim had traumatized damage on his upper torso.
The officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas in 48 hours of safety care and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 hair in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's competitions with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with ranges of beauty products with special assistants in the style of wholesale stores.
As part of a major effort to enter the UK beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they prove to be successful.
The investment in beauty products is based on the fact that the supermarkets are looking for new products for shelters used in the past for television, microwave ovens and residential products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing Sortings from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more space with fired areas in style with them, you can see in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also relaxs the sorting of Boutique-makeup so that most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop is located in two Saninsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against buying small quantities of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets need to make more people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops come to be like large stores, in view of the fact that the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the Aldi and Lidl discount chains by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily goods and have made the purchases more profitable.
Previously, the Supermarket's attempt to update beauty and apothecary divisions led to errors.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00's, but cooperation ended with a question about how the performance of the apothecaries in the supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their apothecaries with 281 stores to Celesio, owned by the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury wood fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and arrangement on our rows with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in highly educated colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our selection of fires is designed to meet all the needs and the environment and the practical positions mean that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "associated" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal to 11 million GBP
Dragons' The Star Peter Jones left "resulting", after the Hollywood Willoughby TV, withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBPs with his life-style fire to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home product and accessories fire Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This Morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' The Star Peter Jones racing, after she's drawn from their luxurious lifestyle in the last minute – to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was "responsive" when the popular TV woman during an active Tuesday meeting in the capital of his business seminar in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – meant that she no longer had enough time for their residential product and accessory fire Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop fire and was designed to double Willoughby's estimated volume of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly, while Jones fled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would have been a long-term project that she would have been dealing with in the next few decades.
Her decision to move was surprising to all involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a store full of goods in the main room in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts consider that the announcement from The Morning Star, which is among the most highly valued stars of the United Kingdom, can cost the company several million dollars due to large investments in products – all from powder to steel lighting for clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother to three Willoughby and the family Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly together with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the Governing Council in March.
The two couples take vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be a M&S firebasser and replaces Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business approach."
Hard to talk, "and then we were in love"
He made a joke with the criticism he would get from the media to make a comment that "is not a valuable president" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
said Trump in his parish at a news store.
"I didn't do anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a more meeting, after Trump held their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the automation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on automation have been in progress.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "compared reaction" from the United States compared to North Korea's initial response to equipment.
He noted that instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the press running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view of the speech at his election meeting.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"There was an attack on war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results – the completion of rocket tests, the release of guides and the sending of Earth’s remnants from American military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing at the group just before him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes kill hundreds
In the post-Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although over 10 per cent of the population of Lomboks were homeless, the national disaster situation was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children combines a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute to emergency aid action.
Due to the earthquakes, Indonesia is constantly being exposed, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami is built in Aceh, but they are not usually seen on other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there was a apparent lack of tsunamis, and it is likely to have affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat land-free is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lack of infrastructure a central point in its campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
However, Mr Jokos' administration has been affected by lack of funding in the context of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experienced pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of confidence.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and thousands were taken away from their homes, when Christians and Muslim bands fought on the streets with masks, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge compared to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a basement in Premier League to Chelsea with a score of 89 minutes on Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his hold was behind 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with left foot before he made a high shot at the remotest columns.
The cloud flew high over the field to the top right corner of the net.
The ball fell over a bunch of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get caught in the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a simple confession, and I didn't think so much about it, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at half, after the Belgian stars Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The Chelsea striker delivered the cave back to Mateo Kovacic before he put the speed up on the central street and pushed into Liverpool's railway section.
Kovacic made a quick e-to on the midway.
Then he made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from defense and ended up against the remotest column with a shot with the left-hand side of Liverpool's Alison Becker.

Deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia rise to 832
The death rate from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 informs the country’s disaster preparedness early Sunday.
There were reports of many arrests in the walls from buildings that fell after the earthquake that measured 7.5 on the directional scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, told the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by walls from combined buildings.
Politicians arrest a man at 32 under suspicion of murder, after women are tortured to death
A murder investigation is under way after a woman's death was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44th year was found at 7.55 a.m. by Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard anything about progress.
Police assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would invite all those who stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite all, especially tax carriers, who may have taken up anything with the Dashcam, to contact us as they can have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman, if found, is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found in a property.
This afternoon, friends who think to know the woman came over to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say that they are being informed of the victim.
A tax officer who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but gets the police to know that no one has to enter the building.
He was shot when he heard what had happened.
The citizens now know there's going to be hours before they can come in again.
A police officer was told to tell a man that the whole area is now considered a place of business.
A terrible woman is coming.
She's getting back, "it's so scary."
At 14 p.m., there were two police cars in front of the car and another car just outside.
A number of officials were present in the hearing and monitored the apartment complex.
All information is requested to write a message directly to @MerPolCC, calling to 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's status of Cromwell will be the last monument to be drawn up by the discussion on "recording history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic, Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "galsacic" and a "test to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the context of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell without the palace at Westminster would be a goal.
The image storm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his predecessor Thomas' actions in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic image of Cromwell is a testimony to the positions of the 19th century and a part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worth searching.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defence of Parliament against excessive pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known figure representing the one side of the struggle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth hiding and remembering."
Dröbergris passes over and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a grey on a market in southern China according to local media reports.
The man who was only identified under his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a overcrowded pulse and bleeding in blood near a greylist on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A gray farm prepares to give gray injections with vaccines by a gray buck on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 rice on the market.
The next morning, his father found him dead and discovered that a door to the Christian door was open.
He said that in the Christian congregation there was a big nose with blood in his mouth.
A medical study confirmed that the 250 kg Greek had requested the farmer to die, according to the report.
"My father's legs were bleeding and wet," said the father, who goes under the last name "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras records showed Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. to feed his gray.
His law was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his descendants.
One market leader told Evening News that the crisis had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
This is true of the rare species, but there has been a history of cases where Greece has attacked people.
In 2016 a grey woman and her husband attacked their garden in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 395 - kilograms of a Walisian farmer against his tractor, into his wife threatened the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his rice in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told him that wheat is not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "tricker".
"They're just medical.
The nipples, they're very curious... they're not gonna hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa Orc is expected to give heavy rain in much of the southwestern USA
As foretold, the source of Rosa will become weaker, as it moves over the cooler water at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be very much aware of floods in northern Mexico and the southern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1-hour, at 10 Sundays (dansk time) and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is forming a low-pressure passage over the Pacific, moving towards the east of the U.S. coast. After Rosa approaches half of the Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it starts to jump tropically up north into the south-west United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical rain will interact with the low pressure current that will come closer and create a strong rain in the south-western United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm rain will create dangerous storms, flowing down and possibly soiled in the desert.
The tropical fungus will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to reach 51 to 101 mm of rain in parts of the southern United States, in particular over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the desert to the foot when there is a threat to tropical rain.
Powerful rain can turn clouds into floating rivers and droughts will create powerful local winds and create dust bubbles.</seg>
The low pressure current that is approaching will provide a strong rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total drop of more than 13 mm, which can give less amounts of liquid drop and smooth road.
This would be the first reduction in the region in its accounting period.
Scattered tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread to the area Four Corners Tuesday and continues Wednesday.
In October there can be a great temperature rise throughout the United States, after the Arctic is cooler, but there is a reasonable amount of heat in the trophies.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of a dramatic difference in temperature over the Central American Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Most parts of the central and eastern USA are expected to experience a warm start on October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern edges to the parts of the northern regions.</seg>
There can be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate perspective indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million then the sound of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million of the Thursday's catch-up statements from the nominated high-ranked Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual abuse that occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that broke the ordinary programmes to tell about the recent developments of the Friday: an agreement concluded by Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, which gave the FBI a law to conduct a week's investigation of the complainants.
Ford told the Senate's ruling committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was in a state of shock and tried to take her clothes off to a gymnasium.
Kavanaugh said in an emotionally charged statement that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it Friday.
The company opened average serial numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available serial numbers from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a serial number corresponding to a fight under the NFL playoffs or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose meanings are strongly reflected in the appointment of Kavanaugh, was above all stations with an average of 5.69 million years ago during the hearing that was all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was on the second floor of 3.26 million years ago.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of peace.
Following his announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators called him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the ruling committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while he was beaten out, and CNN sent his life.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth to the country?"
He got to know, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All the television stations covered life a few hours later, when the ruling committee would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would continue to vote for the whole period.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the conviction that the FBI would investigate the complainants against the nominated one next week, which the Democrats, who are in a submission to the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators followed, Fleke took his decision.
The choice of the flag had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the complainants against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "low politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "low politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front of the trial, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that the UK and the EU should collect the rates of each other was "high through later".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspecting to stand behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player on LSU.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of innocent men's arrest, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officials released videos of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police found the glasses on the ground and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After Simpson's release, the police said he had witnessed the murder on Wayde.
His rent is set to $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The medical doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where there was that the cause of death was an injury from a gun shot coming from the head to the neck.
The police department says that a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the State's police lab, the Southern University police and citizens in the area have assisted with the research that led to the arrest.
The leader of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for their "emhu and hunt for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "knush" and "in shock" over the death of Waydes.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulkan spy ice over Mexico City
Asche, which is spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The national disaster prevention centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano after the crater’s activity, and 183 emissions of gas and gas were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitored the room and the roses over multiple stages.
Social media images showed dark layers of axles on cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south of the capital, since a earthquake measuring 7.1 on the directional scale rose central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police support with Catalan separatists prior to the vote on independence
Sex was arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrations that want independence, accompanied by opulent officials, with thousands of participants in revaliating demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists kept up-to-date, threw and pulverized, and created dark dust holes on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also similar targets later on the day when the police used their letters to hold the fighting down.
For several hours, groups of independence "Not forgotten, not forgiven", and were met with Union demonstrators, who called "Long Life in Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage that occurred during the protests reported the local press.
The vote continued to be high in the region of independence one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but was celebrated by separate Catholic Catholics.
The voters voted to a great degree for independence, but the election was low, and those who opposed the resolution voted in a large-scale manner.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the voting during violent meetings at voting stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had campaigned for Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the withdrawal of the national police.
The demonstration was suspended, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer lost hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"First year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy that they had the opportunity to vote, but now we are standing firm," he said.
Although they received a sneeze, but important, victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain the moment, and many of their best known leaders are either moved into exile or in detention and wait for their role in the observance of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, picked up the protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who had been waiting for his case since last year, announced that he would vote for the European Parliament next year.
"The job as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to take the distance from the return to the democratic values and the defeat we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house framed by car
Three men in 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car several times in a house in Londonderry.
The event occurred in the Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It may also have been cancelled by an armrest against the car at a time.
Skud from Menga gives Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first target for Livingston secured victory
The drinkers Livingston exceeded Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second download after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot the difference, when Gary Holts held up side by side with Hibernian on the other side.
Gerrard's remains have not been won on the outside of the league in this season and will meet the leading member of Hearts, which they have eight points after next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Livingston builds up their unscathed strip for six battles, and Captain Holt has not yet received a download since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chance against cash content
Holts would have been long before, they scored, and their direct game style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow accidentally hit without the target, after he was happy to frame Craig Halket's double head before the target.
The housekeeper was pleased to let Rangers play before them because they knew that they were able to keep up with the problems of death.
And it was under those circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers started a free park, and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together built up to Menga, which made an experiment and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the football team, but fought to get through the defense of the home, and Mr. Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos took a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shooting was avoided with the births of Ranger's target man Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was shot outside the framework under another of Livington's deaths.
There were ongoing deliverys in Livingstone's field, but it was refused, and two requirements for a criminal park – after Halket's thanks to the replacement of Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Physical effort and strong results for Livingston.
All played fantasticly and exceeded the expectations of their outstanding trip.
Their style of play and their troops have been largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honour must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened himself since he reached it.
There were a lot of people.
He claims Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and many held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the streets throughout the fight.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerarrd, but they played under level.
Their conclusions lacked scarphed – only once they got their own home – and it is a great alert for Rangers, who is in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Køln
There was a sweet and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disunity has arisen over areas such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's approaches to the EU.
Erdogan then took to Köln to open a new, big Moscow.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police, for security reasons, had a population of 25,000 from gathering in front of Moscow, but many of the support appeared close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents — many of them Kurdians — also noted and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to oppose the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a whole of some German Turks and the horse as an autocrat of others.
Unheld on the road in Deptford: Cyclelist dies in combination with car
A cyclelist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there was a rescuer on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after a second cycle of death in a meeting with a car running from the spot on the Child's Street, about 1.6 km from the sound of the day.
The Metropolitan Police said the police officers were working to identify the man and inform him about him.
Road drills have been installed, bus routes have been refurbished, and motorists are encouraged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin prison: Sex officer injured under the watch
Six prison officers have been injured during hours in a high-security prison according to the Prison Office.
There was an hour in the HMP Long Larsin prison in Worcestershire about 9.30 BST Sunday, and the inconveniences are still under way.
The Specialized "Tornado" service has been taken in order to manage the operations involving eight inmates and is carried out in one flight of the prison.
The agents were treated for minor eye damage on the site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Special trained prison staff are engaged in dealing with the current inequalities in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the officers are being notified to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 employees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an attack.
And in October last year, the U.S. officer was called to prison to handle serious irregularities, where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
The body of Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm flows (twisted areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but it is most likely that at the beginning of the next week, when the rest of the source of the Rosa are moving across the desert country in the south of the United States and creating a risk of storm floods.
National Weather Service has already sent warnings about storm floods for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "the tropical Cyclones had preserved status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a corner within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to be 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For them without the risk of storms, the Rossa rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Superstition is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the accounts will benefit because the South-West USA is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's minimum extreme dry, the highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the Russian Orc is expected to frame country on half the Baja California in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has energy power Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north with 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls stronger.
It is therefore expected to cover Mexico with tropical power Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain on parts of Mexico can become severe and pose a serious risk to obesity.
"There is expected a drop of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the north-west Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, before it comes to Arizona early on Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or the rest of it is very severe rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern corner of the United States," National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-increasing torrents and floating declines in the deserts as well as earthquakes in mountain ranges.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were detained suspected of murder, after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in Radstock, the police in Avon and Somerset.
The agency has invited all those who have had to have mobile receptions of the events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was in front of the Democratic Party's "dangerous and angry"
"A voice at Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the carelessness and inhuman tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been exposed to "restraint, anger" from the democratic party through the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness before the convention on Thursday and reported strong and sensitive accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually immoral to her for many years since they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a statement of testimony in the hearing of his complaints.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people were so bold, good-looking and bold" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the greatest legal cores in our time, a jurist with a wonderful past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of meeting the Republicans at the polls during the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks there is one of the most important choices in our life.
You can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "fight against and blockers".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, a person in the Republican party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the death toll increases
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were thrown away from fighting waves that hit the beach, when a large earthquake and a large tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, declared authorities on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at a time of shock, sucked many in death, and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami was born after a earthquake measuring 7.5 on the steering wheel.
"When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still running on the beach. They did not run the same and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, during a letter in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, the sleeping car, trees, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More and more were able to survive by climbing trees to escape tsunamis, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published air photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, damaged and combined brothers and a Moscow surrounded by water.
Afterwards, the coastal town continued to rise on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be identified in an area of 2.4 million people.
In an announcement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT), the energy released during the great earthquake of peace was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima during World War 2.
The town is geographically located at the end of a long, small bug, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "abstaining" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were managed together.
The corpses of a number of victims were found standing under the walls of assembled buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been damaged and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and damage could be greater than 300 km long coastal north of Palu, the area of Donghea, located near the epicenters of the earthquake.
The communication "has been completely lamched without information" from Donghaa, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 here," said Red Cors in a statement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
On Saturday, the government was criticized from many fronts not to announce that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was sent.
In amateur occupations, which are part of social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building that despairs to warn of the tsunami coming closer to the people on the road below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water covers the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the records with the same.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge flow of energy that cancels the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue action.
The military has begun sending cargo flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, notifying authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city's airport has been refurbished, but only for work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centre in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donghea have certainly come to Palu City, where employees are looking for lily during exhibitions in the garden at their account. They came across areas with extensive destructions on the road, Doseba said.
"They told me they were so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Despite the fact that aid organisations began their work in the Baltic region by re-establishing aid, there was a complaint that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, economic support, supplies and workers from abroad must only come in if the area where the disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a numbering person for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open for international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of the day, friends and family of the weak people were firmly convinced that their neighbors would be the miracles that light the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled up by a clock.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under the walls for two days with her mother’s law behind her.
Gendon Subanono, the trainer for the Indonesian paragliding country, had trained two of the missing paraglids to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were arrested at Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandiya, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how he, after the news of the co-administration of Roa Roa Roa Hotel, had suddenly sent whatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted only in one gray river instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Tive takes $26,750 while filling in Newport on the Level
Two stole Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink's agent, who was doing a cash car in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car’s driver had cleaned up the cash machine in the maintenance complex and prepared to deliver more money, the criminal assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "on the back of the Brink's staff" and stole a sponge that would have been delivered.
So many suspects fled the place, according to the press report, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All with information on the identity of the trains are requested to contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West replaces the name to Ye.
He announced the shift day on Twitter, where he wrote: "The old woman known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had named Ye for a short time and used the name as title on its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singing Ariana Grande on the show, which was ignored by "feelings of reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier this year, where he discussed his album title with the Big Boy radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but in the year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former co-operation partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico AMLO does not promise to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has never promised to use military power against civilians, since the country is about 50 years old for a bloody act against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to undermine the Mexican people."
Tropper struck a peaceful demonstration at the site on 2 October 1968 and killed 300 at a time when left-wing student movements hit many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and open several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
After China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use in field research, says investors and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come from various parts of the American Government, however, to provide information on artificial intelligence. The United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation within the framework of artificial intelligence at the latest in 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, since all other countries are so far away from the United States, and we are following the next major breach within the AI," said Lee.
Redoubled the budget could double the chances of the next major performance in the United States, Lee told CBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Hughton Mifflin Harcourt and is the Managing Director for Synoving Ventures, who has invested in one of the most outstanding companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranked American Othello players, and later he became the leader of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technological competitions supported by the American government, such as Robotics Challenge, which was held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next viewers could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain loans from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that breaks the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employed in recent years as star-students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs within artificial intelligence must have offered job permits automatically.
The Chinese State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people on academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence established a joint centre for artistic intelligence to involve industry and research partners, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over $100 million annually in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to establish a national safety committee for artificial intelligence, has stood for several months.
Macedonians vote on the change in the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, an action that would resolve an 18-year-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province on behalf of Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring countries to the north constitutes a requirement in the Greek territory and has therefore used their vector when Macedonia has sought entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the main Macedonian slave population.
President Gjerge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the vote will constitute the 50% required to become valid.
The question on the vote was: "Are you a NATO and EU member with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Subjects of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the EU's umbrella, because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote and do so.
The amendment would require a majority in Parliament on two thirds.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 p.m. no irregularities were reported.
However, the election was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We hear home in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a president of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the Macedonian vote on a change in the name of the country, which would open for NATO and the EU membership in Struca, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled a chair up front of the hall, which was set up by those who wanted to vote.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we're going to win membership with a strong pande, not to the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a strong investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think a large majority will vote for because over 80 percent of our citizens are going to join the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "insurance of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the required electoral participation.
A second assessment by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Out of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss of the pilot government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero struggle through the entire Bridgeton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought against the Bridgeton defense in Manchester Citys 2-0-year-old on Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero was able to look slowly out with his score, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentinan attack received a delivery on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenses before he broke out on the open road.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green trucks.
He fought across one defense, and then followed by several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English president used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right to list Brighton target Matthew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with the babies," said the City Manager Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about how he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate escape in the Premier League.
The target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero saw in the next ball deep into Brighton's territory.
He sent a great delivery along the left bank to Leroy Sane.
True took a couple of consultations before he led Sterling against the remotest columns.
Sky Blues forwarded the ball in the net just before it was glad over the target.
The city fights against Hoffenheim in the champions League game at 12.55 Tuesday at Rhea-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Cursor Blinking Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff sharing, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the castle Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still an opportunity to participate in the playoffs for Rockies, which has played a fight more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild-card square with a 5-2-winer over National Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the battle well aware that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the public here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level at the highest level, I'm going to stand up for this year.
Why wouldn't I be excited to play under those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet announced the launch for Sunday, but will probably introduce Scherzer as a point in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the platform for 34 times, trained his cast Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his holiday.
The right-hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strakeouts in 220 2/3 entrances in this season.
Trump holds a election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation about his election to the High Representative, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of the meeting of the Republicans at the polls during the midway elections.
"All we've done is on the game in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big – you can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me. That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you can see, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to get power back with all the resources available. You can see how vicious they are.
They're equal to who they hurt, who they're going to drive to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have as a mission "strip against and blockers".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "failure and malicious and malicious and false."
He referred to the highest democratic senator in the Senate's ruling committee on behalf of Diane Feinstein, which issued a loud message from the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you close the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, no, wait, it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
The lab is no longer a romantic party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
Since Moment's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am only the last of a number of Members of Parliament from Labor who have been informed that we are not welcome – only because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship went out to criticize me because I was against Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, there are ironic problems similar to those of Jeremy’s former leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour Friday there was that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a local parliament member, the meetings have been like this on Friday evening.
Today, the tone in many meetings is not that way, and the law on "friendly, brighter" policy is far behind in the past, if it ever came into force.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour and that all opinions are considered whether the party's management can accept them.
It was soon after, Jeremy was the leader when colleagues whom I had previously believed that I was involved in politics began to expect that I would make a U-turn and adopt attitudes that I would never have agreed in – whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it is really very much what I say – it follows a long stream of bad news on the social media that calls for the rejection and rejection of the secondary policy and tells me that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my fellow Members because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the struggle among my fellow Members, who are subjected to sexism or racism every day, but still fight further.
One of the most shocking aspects of this political honour is where abuse has become common.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labor would create a tolerant culture.
In reality, however, there is no longer a spacious organisation and with each miscellaneous vote or change of electoral rules, the party will become more vulnerable.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and is not so high, I'm going to have to get 'em ready'.
But that is not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of the Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government to leave our classroom in a state of emergency, and I set myself up to provide better public services for those who need it most — regardless of whether it has been a board member or a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in some way confused about my political positions and differences with the current leadership.
To those who made the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when it comes to Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Director of Labor.
But one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threats to election or political ownership will prevent me from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Year 38 - 17 Melrose: Unforeseen Ayr will be held
Two later scores may have been the final result of drawing a non-confidential picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this fantastic entertainment match of the day in Tennt's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the score table and are the only uneven ten.
Finally, it was as high as their relative defenses as their better use of the chance that they would take home, and Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our struggle has been demanding so far, and we are still unsatisfied, so I need to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Regarding Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful score from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a gold card to Scottish national player Rory Hughes, who was divided into the Warriors' fight, gave Melrose a advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a score.
Climo built Ayr's operation with a penalty park just before the half-way. He scored and then got a solo score, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, which was followed by a park from Baggot, reduced the score to five.
Then there was a long break because Ruardh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was thrown out of the boat's path. When the game was reopened, Ayr started with a scoring from Stafford McDowell and a consecutive park from Climo.
Acting Air carrier Blair Macpherson then received a gold card, and Melrose again used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without consecutive parking after a period of intense pressure.
However, the host came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card to thank Climo without the ball, MacPherson could follow a line-out score behind the coming Ayr kid.
Climo followed up with a score inside the columns and followed up with a more close after, the game was reopened, after Kyle Rowe invented David Armstrong's box kick and sent flight players Gregor Henry off to the fifth score of the bus home.
Set game stars on display after new careers in the restoration industry
The Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restaurant, after it has been shown that he has taken the office of Director of an authorised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person in association with his partner Greg Hemhill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and that Kiernan plans a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of the Operation Morning Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, but a source pointed out to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "increasing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": The state of Bolivia hopes that the court will resume its course to the Pacific Sea
The seamen patrol around the fleet’s main rooms, which are located in the mountains, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a sea blue flag.
Flight bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are superimposed with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the Netherlands, Bolivia is remembered for a coastal route that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, still strong, and the same length is after sailing on the Pacific.
The expectations may be at their peak for several years, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years' vote.
"Bolivia has a moment, a feeling of community and clarity, and naturally waits for a positive view of the event," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will give Bolivia its share in the fact that Chile, after several decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate the sovereignty of Bolivia over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president, who stands in front of a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot to play during the trial day.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has sat in the Netherlands, has no power to extend the Chilean territory and has provided that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international jury.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given way back.
"The case of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has done it with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in Haag, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was abnormal.
Monday, Bolivia will get "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new honour of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end a honour of 139 years with disagreement and benefit both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political crisis.
"Bolivia will never grant access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judiciary is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there's no nuclear equipment coming, unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never defeat their nuclear weapons if they cannot rely on Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to comply with the commitments made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were extended to the fact that US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a relaunch of the most determined nuclear diplomat over three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "demand dream" to continue sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War, sometimes will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is standing against the declaration, so long as Pyongyang has not first taken a significant step against degradation.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump will have a more summit.
But there has been widespread uncertainty about whether Pyongyang is serious about eliminating an arsenal, which the country most likely views as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to increase your hate collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne went up on the catwalk for a collection of remarkable main clothing in an extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by Paris Fashion Week.
Very ineffective has dominated Instagram in summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catwalk creatures down.
The most impressive work from Valentino was an overcrowded with a four-dimensional mirror covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with juveles and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also discovered a selection of strange masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined leaves that remembered more about Hannibal Lecter than skin Couture.
One creation looked like a dark green with snorkel and mask, and the other looked like a dirty waffles.
And if you continue the big fashions, you're lucky.
Sculptors predict that they could have come to shops near you.
The battles arrive in the halls of "La Bomba", the beam with a 60-centimeter wide shadow that is seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The brand of culture behind the highest unencumbered hat, which has been distributed over the social media, has sent a new creation down to the catwalk – a beach bag in the stream, which is almost as large as the model that presents it.
The orange bast bag with bast brakes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to the F.J.: "I expect to see large horses and beaches in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has been so influential that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in combat size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a lot of academic results behind them, and in 2018 there are still a number of unique exam results, which are strengthened above the purchase by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With an increase of 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are pursuing the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their selected careers and their place as global citizens.
As a training sector that can compile and implement a broken pension, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject at school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that's the chapter.
If you talk to him in his own language, it's the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just keep ourselves in English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see on the latest exam results in the year that language is the highest in statistics with most of the existing exams in independent schools.
In all, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the highest quality A.
The data collected by SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received character A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences, which children and young people will need in the future.
Languages are now considered the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the minds of independent schools and other places.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not afford jobs, 17% had language skills to do.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More jobs will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever careers young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a vital skill like this.
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multi-language person a starting point to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 respondents in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
It is therefore important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are given a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there are differences between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important to Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the country's future in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this emphasis on Scotland's youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets a party for Lakers' Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in the Sunday's opening battle before the start of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's playing.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reports Mike Trudell doubled that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans relative to Lakers' planned six battles before the start of the season.
"Where I am in my career I don't have to fight before the start of the season to be ready," he said.
Trips election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled election meetings in the next week, including meetings in Tromp-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Tromps appointed judges to the sitting of the High Court has been taken into account, Trump is trying to draw attention to the forthcoming midway elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you view it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (dansk time) between Saturday, 29 November and Sunday, 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's selection meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the High Court. The hearings were held because of complaints about sexual harassment, and the expected vote in the afternoon about confirmation was taken into account in a week while the FBI is investigating the complainants.
But the main objective of this series of elections is to create a moment for the Republicans who are facing a very high election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign content said that the five election meetings next week aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when the Republicans try to protect and build the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, now that we are entering the busy campaign," said a speaker for the Trump campaign, which would not be mentioned by name, to Reuters.
The evening's election is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he watered with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the considerations.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is forced up to give him a boost in the measurement," said Simon Haeder, who works with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown the campaign and is trying to keep the hope alive for Sunday's single hours
After three unique rounds, the sound day's company duties may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The moving moment pendulum is a whole through the unknown concept of sport, but a concept which players believe – not at least by competitions like this.
Where would they say there's a moment now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we see it a little bit like a moment," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the Friday.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have little wind in the streets, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can both talk with three points of four possibilities.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to grass and sets a good example for his roommates.
The high jurors became higher, after which the round continued, and Spieth struck an important path, which ensured victory in due four, even though he and Thomas had been two shots behind two holes.
His dog, who assured them of the fight on hell 15 was met with a similar threat – the kind of cry that shows that he doesn't think the American content is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength out and focus on your own struggle," said Spieth.
That's all, the players are back now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the greatest story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's dark but sympathic couple have been given four points in four wars, and there is a lack of interest.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine Sundays Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy appears to fly both to and from the wild audience shows that it is they, it will be hard to beat Sunday. And it would certainly be very popular if a potential European victory is being decided by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Allerhelst's synchronous on each of their wheels.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process against Sergio Garcia, tomorrow in the company halls, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the svensker down in a hole they were never close to getting out.
Sunday there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The games with four balls and two pieces of a two players are so fascinating to look at close ties due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played a better role as it continues and has created a significant action before the last day, but the company dealers have also shown that the team USA has the most successful fighter, like some, especially in the United States.
Europe creates action on 10-6 before the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with an action over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victorys over a poor Tiger Woods and has still received four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European team, which is trying to win the poker they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an excellent American team in the morning's four ball and water series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in Foursomes, they fought four battles, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's holding shall use eight points in the 12 single-day sun, if they are to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensitive weekend, is just another couple in the history of Ryder Cups, who have won four points in their first four games.
The Knuts Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs and then had an elegantly opposed Woods and the American Debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a more impressive 57-4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had a little brilliant smile, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in three.
Justin Rose was the lucky one for tomorrow's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2--1-win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
However, Europe has as much as they would like to have, on a light spring day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-fold Major Winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fight 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Fourballs and later turned back and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in Foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It is only two times in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being back with four points before the single camp. When Furyks currently has the pocal, however, they must only win to keep it.
After two days of work, however, it seems that they can’t master a tired Sunday.
North Korea says they won't fall unilaterally if there's no confidence.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would strengthen their failure to reach the United States and that the country would not release their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the world-wide organization's general meeting that North Korea had developed a "significant goodwill" in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and Missile testing, developing an area of nuclear testing and law not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"With no confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and fall unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" access to nuclear equipment, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took step-by-step steps, but his speech was important since it did not explicitly reject unilateral equipment, as it had previously been from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between a recent American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atom equipment on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal conclusion in the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first issue their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to the bloodshed of international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'atom equipment first' and develops pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us into a bone is a dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our guilt."
Ri did not mention a more summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader mentioned earlier this week.
On the contrary, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If the nuclear power would be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so determined."
However, the tone in Russia was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the removal of North Korea rockets against the American country was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total reconciliation" of North Korea, but last year he rose Kim to protest in relation to degradation, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions are necessary to remain until North Korea falls.
Today Trump said he didn't have a schedule for these actions, but he said, "It's just a lot, if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with assurance and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear equipment."
Since 2006, the Security Council has consistently increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the side line during the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there had been progress, while North Korea only a few hours after accusing him of "aggressive demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and an atomic complex if the United States took "a similar step."
He said Kim had told him that the "compared steps", he demanded, were the security agreements that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against normalization of the relationship to Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all Bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to modernize the growing macho culture, where you study all night kept up with large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best universities often do not understand the first thing about self-esteem.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after having held a lecture about the effects of sleep failure on education.
"When the job was done, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get this first to know now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time in the year, explains how good sleep habits can improve the academic and sports performance of one and the overall well-being of the students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Administrative Director of the University’s Health Area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleeplessness during the week.
The short course consists of different interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a college room where students should click on coffee cups, gardens, laundry and books to learn about the effects of coffee and light, how even sports performance is affected by sleeplessness, and how important sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants learn how long sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We know well that it will not change the student's behavior with the same.
But we think they have the right to know - as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking a "all night" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have caused sleeplessness to be a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and fear is good and enough sleep, he said – it even affects weight gain, because sleeplessness makes the brain believe that it is hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old californie, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler last year to organize the course when he took one of his courses for his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next day all the graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends that the students set up an alarm, so they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can creep into the day’s sleep and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Objectives from many branches Gerrard and co.
Ranger's lead was another landing on the outside, when Dolly Mengas' target meant that Steven Gerrard's unique hold had to be taken with a landing on 1-0 in Livingstone.
The hold from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the outdoors since the 4.1-triumphane on St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holts held that only second down in 18 games that train. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbroke's Premiership.
Many hits seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangershold could not answer.
Rangers now smokes on a sixth place, while Livingston demands up on a third place after Hibernian with only the target score for difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, when line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a broken object, which would lead out of the outer section.
Gerard made eight changes in the design that reached Bethfed Cups semifinal by toning through Ayr.
On the other hand, Holt stood with the same 11, who barbed a point of Hearts' action last week, and he would have been afraid to see his sharp stick the contrasts across the road.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should've scored two minutes in the fight, when the Mengas first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player's attempt was over.
A free park in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halket, but his defense player Alan Lithgow jumped across the lowest column.
The Rangers took control, however, but played more on hope than on the ability of the attack game.
In any case, Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson knew the Colombians' appeals for a criminal park, when he and Steven Lawless were brought together after a quarter.
The Rangers only had two shots on targets in the first half, but former Rangers Targeter Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibally's head wound and Ovie Ejaria's stupid shot.
Although Lewis opening in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said that it is worth their effort alone.
No one could deal with a deathblowing situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in target.
In the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, who almost immediately gave the father, when the pilot sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from its position to block.
But Livingston insisted on playing their prizes with many long balls up the way from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's men could have extended the action in the final part of the struggle, but McGregor denied Jacobs with his right hand before Lithgow called on the side of the target.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late criminal park after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Source: The Founder of the Gegittals
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we are TÉLLER... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has found a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a finding that would lead to the device known as the geyster.
The Gegierttteller has become a firm component of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main pillars of science as a Buddhist scientist:
Man: "What is in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser that's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take these main phones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans, "Stop it now, there's going to be it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he wanted to fill 63.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune response to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune response to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune response to detecting cancer cells as a result of treatment
The method is to extract immunity from a patient and change them into the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein that is common to many forms of cancer and where they are re-injected
A test vaccine appears to be promising in patients with a number of forms of cancer.
When a woman with breast cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches immunodeficiency to detect cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immunity from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" protein in the name of HER2, which has many forms of cancer, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "makes various forms of cancer to develop", including breast, ear, lung and brain cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when taking immunocells out of patients and "learning" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.

After a unique performance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was relieved when he joined the US President Donald Trump, and said he himself would stand up as presidential candidate in 2020.
When he played the third song of Ghost Town last night, he introduced a Make America Great Again box, he started on a protest against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I speak so loud to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have been moved from the United States for too long," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made a joke with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's decision on Christine Blasey Ford's ex-consultation.
Even though the recordings were not shown, comicist Chris Rock Wests drew on the social media.
There's no doubt whether Rock tried to expose the West by setting up the records.
In addition, West complained to the public about poor treatment backstage due to its main clothing.
"They made me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They made me laugh!
And they said I was so deep," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I am?" and said that he would take his Superman hat on, because it means "You can't decide what to do. Do you want to move on in the world?
Try with love."
The public rented at least twice his comments, and the SNL staff allowed to be very interested, informs Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomb in the study."
The West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose current friend, rapper Mac Miller, had arrived a few days earlier.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received feedback from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said twice: "To one of the bravest people: TOWARD NOT TO LADE YOU OF THE PROBLEM."
Talkshower Karen Hunter doubled that West just "who he is, and it's really nice."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his dress or his "art"), who captures and exploits an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's got a law.
And we have it," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a change of name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who has changed his name, and follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap Collegiate Snoop Dogg has been known as Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formly Know as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Longer After Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known to spin the sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress continues after the stereotypical macho-helt and says that the kind of TV features mean that young men often feel they should be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he thinks there's been "something wrong" and asked how to handle the problem with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, recently married to his Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very late".
"I've been in a lot of trouble since then – where have we gone wrong in town with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the problems we are dealing with, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculinity.
He continued, "What is born of you and what is born of you?"
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel they should be men in this way?
I think it is one of the major issues of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something went wrong for the young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not make followers of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "completed with shooting marks and horses".
Kit has since November been involved in a rehearsal of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is sad.
The actress recently discovered that he considered it to have met his wife Rose as the best of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my next family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygrites, such as Kit's character, Jon Snow, is featured in, in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the country heritage of the Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China has published a 14 % increase in the number of HIV and AIDS victims.
More than 820,000 people in the country are injured, it is heard by the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, reports to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in the Yunnan province.
In one year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the China LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT persons is, according to a growing phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry before or after women because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised free and fair access to HIV medicines as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters notes that staff collected data on Republican senators and torrents against "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
A member of the representative's House of Maxine Waters filed on Saturday's charges that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the claims originated from home pages and support from "the highest right wing".
"Laughs, lies, and several terrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter account.
The published information contained allegedly home address and phone number on the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate about sexual abuses against the so-called Brett Kavanaugh.
It happened after the three senators had challenged Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that IP addresses pointed out that the information was posted by Waters people, and then published information about a member of Water's staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded complaint is completely useless and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my step, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these sad and false accusations, is not in any way responsible for this doctor of information.
This unfounded complaint is completely useless and a direct lie."
Waters' release quickly received criticism online, among other things from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's a hot mess," wrote Fleischer.
"It means that she does not have the right temperature to be a member of the Congress.
If you are accused of something you haven't done, you don't have to be angry.
You don't have to be bold.
There is no need to raise the question of the complainant's motives.
You must keep your senses."
Fleischers allowed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Kavanaugh, who were criticized for being too angry during the Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to take Waters' place in the Central Committee, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he doubled.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the governing authority on these sensitive claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my step."
Notification of Johnny English strikes again – undermining spin comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to follow a Brexit angle in all new movies with a British Isle, and it also seems relevant to the newest action committee in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Do you want dry, sarcastic self-sacrifice, where we are concerned, to become the new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber eye and the big eyes have been allowed to make brothers again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention directed towards places where the biographers do not speak English.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a small Clouseau, a knifepin's Mr. Bean, and a proper dress by him, who presented a single tone to the Chariots of Fire-sangen at the opening ceremony of the OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world’s exciting and international luxury book that left chaos in his cool water, after Atkinson posted him on Barclaycard’s television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot of the JE tribe.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying a medium-age equipment, and the propellers cried against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite subtly and inflexible, especially now that more "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer on convincing comics like an ingredient.
The humor makes it easier for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's short adventures are not as obvious and focused as Atkinson's studio film fans in the role of Mr. Bean.
The immediate starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-level spy network and revealed the identity of all the English agents in the field of transportation to the responsible agent – a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pump and combating prime minister, who has already suffered a complete decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that each active spy has been discovered, she needs to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it is Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of school of Rock education in spying.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hard-tested previous right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married with an overcrowded but well-famous substation – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the king's mission service has already returned to the humble Batman and Robin, when they meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful five battalions, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is moving closer to getting into trouble with the charismatic and anxious tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough are starting their grueling risk-filled estuaries: Predated as servants put the fire to a front of a French restaurant; they create chaos, as they slamm themselves on the table at Volta lususyacht; and English creates pure ragnaro when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make himself known to the Voltas house.
All cannons are created in the final sequence of the film, but how well and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television about it.
Right in the middle.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking about the other Johnny English films: can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to work with a four-day job plan with a fixed wage for the British
Jeremy Corbyns Laborour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be approached with a four-day job, but pay for five.
The Party will, of course, have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give the employees an extra day.
This would mean that the employees would have three days' weekend without going to pay.
Sources say that the idea would agree with the party's economic objective to draw the country into a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day job as a way for workers to exchange an economy for change.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal was expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It is not going to happen on a day, but a quarter-day job is a goal that corresponds to the party's ability to change the economy for the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day workshop during the election campaign to Parliament's election in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A speaker for the Labour Party said: "A quarter-day worker is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour Minister of Shadow Finance John McDonnell used a party meeting last week to mark his plans for a socio-economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to fly the power back from "anonymous directors" and "users" in supply companies.
The plans of the Ministry of Defence finance are also uncertain whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will have their money back, since a government with Labor could "modre" them in the wake of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers in corporate governance and to create an inclusive fund to allocate 10 per cent of the private companies’ share value to employees who are about to receive against 500 £ a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation on charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has issued the final vote on his appointment to the High Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that took place on Sundays, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could record something that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy wanted to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
Then I called him after this, after the charges had gone forth, and I said, 'Didst thou do it?'
He was steel, specific and unique."
On the other hand, Graham's voice seems to be in the rock.
"I have decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and another would require a very violent apology," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett made it on the most powerful," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it would change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and it has done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City is host to the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will for the seventh time receive thousands of people on Central Park's large plan, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal that is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival began in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that is fighting to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP image), concerters must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can give attention to the goal of making an end of poverty.
But where successfully has Global Citizen been, now where have they been back 12 years to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really change, or is it just another case of "clictivism" – that people feel that they make a difference by signing a subscription collection on the web or making a Twitter account?
Global Citizen notes that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have prompted world leaders to make binding targets and policy measures equivalent to more than $37 billion, which are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 objectives and measures that had been achieved for their actions, which were already over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have still had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has begun in England and is a cooperation between investors and business-related people. They strive to "help children to deliver their full potential" and promises $35 million to solve food problems in Rwanda after having received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cities.
"With the help of the English government, donors, other governments and citizens of other countries as well as of the world as you can become a foothold of the history books of social injustice," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has now promised to improve food for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online invitations. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to a frequently asked question from the householder, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
wrote Global Citizen: "It will become a long and hard struggle, and sometimes we will snibble and make mistakes.
But as with civil rights movement and the movement against apartheid, it will succeed, because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are among the participants at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are to be host.
U.S. can use its flag to "blockers" for Russian energy exports, says the US Interior Minister
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming to the market, even in the Middle East, reveals US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, particularly where they operate on an invitation from the judicial government, is a tax to expand their sales of energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"U.S. has our fleet opportunity to ensure that there are free passage on the seas, and if necessary, we can also block them, so we can ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization that considers itself "the voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and said that they are in a bond and a cause.
"The economic opportunities for Iran and Russia are dealing with the use and replacement of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These opinions are based on the intention of the Trump administration to increase the European export of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is the most cheap choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, speakers of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "flag".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion North Stream 2 animal management, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively an economic project.
Kreml believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of different conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the American Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to merge outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party blending into our energy supplies," said BDI leader Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's "inspiredly" to stand up to the presidential election in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's "strengthens strongly" to stand up to the presidential committee after the Central Committee, she said on Saturday.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering stopping.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider setting up the presidential committee."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump to know under the board and said that he "leads the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does at our democracy," she said.
Warren has been quoted in his criticism of Trump and his master's named Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Tuesday Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI must examine the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday's opinion shows that the main part of Warren's own backyard does not mean that it should be set up in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be set up.
32% supported the possible candidate.
The assessment showed greater feedback to former Governor Deval Patrick with 38 % for and 48 % against a possible establishment.
Other highly-professional democratic candidates discussed with the Presidential Committee in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The petition states that he announces his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin names Track Palins PTSD at a selection meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after reporting to the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and sentenced to violence at home.
"That, after he's home, my own son, makes it possible for me to relate to other families that notice the consequences of PTSD and other damages our soldiers are returning home," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his presence "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become stronger. They go and think about whether they are respected for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was sentenced to violence in the home against a woman in order to prevent the notification of violence in the home and to be in possession of a gun in a state of shock, told Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Vasilla.
18 countries and D.C. support against new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Colombia support a legal objection to a new American law refusing asylum to victims fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered Friday in Washington a party-dependent statement to support an asylum seeker who opposes the law is heard by NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case of Grace vs. Sessions, issued by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She argues that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but US officials dismissed her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers come, as countries with considerable problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum law rejected a decision taken by the 2014 American alien name, which allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from violence at home to seek asylum.
The District of Colombia's state attorney, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "is removed from the state, food and international law of the continent."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition is contrary to the principle," states the party-dependent statement.
The lawyers also argued in the declaration that the law on refusal of immigrants would damage the American economy, since it is more likely that they will become self-employed and "give needed labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Session's immigration judge granted the right to give asylum to victims fleeing from violence in the home and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," said Sessions in his announcement of the law on 11 June.
It has never been the idea that asylum would solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the death rate doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu despair
For survival, the situation was only worse.
"It's very exciting," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little fembered boy at an evacation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in straight.
We don't need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined home to sort out over the bloody property and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and the hospitals, also affected by earthquakes of 7.5, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated on the outside for a terrible consequence.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake swept the hotel room on five floors, he shared with his wife and daughters.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was massed up against a ruined wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family would have a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for invalid methods and advertising ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper, a four-page newspaper published an American daily newspaper that hit the drum for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador in China Beijing blames for using the US press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump, referring Wednesday to China Daily paid a quote in the Des Moines Register – Yowas best selling newspaper – after having accused China of mixing in the 6 November Congress elections. China rejects the complaint.
American officials explain to Reuters that Trump's claim for Chinese involvement in the American elections marks a new phase in Washington's escaling campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington is now established in a evasion trade war, where they have increased duty on imports of each other.
China's case-law in the trade war would frame exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trumps, terms Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, former former governor of China in Iowa, who is a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "depends on the use of the unfavourable methods by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of press by running a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the Chinese here in Beijing, however, only a few votes will be found. And you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people to China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, even though he didn't say anything.
Republican women present before the Central Committee on the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
Among many top republicans who support and defend the so-called Brett Kavanaugh against sexual abuse charges, analysts warn that they will experience a moderate reaction in the coming midway elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the kitchen, and most Republicans have already published that they wish to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done," said Grant Reher, professor of state science at the University of Syracuse Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arisona) asked for an FBI investigation at 11 o'clock would be milder.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, who is senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill in Friday.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators called during a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who are in charge of the decision-making committee, chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony from Professor Christine Blasey Ford, hear it from Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the media.
"People say it's already reached a high level; it's true.
But it can now be even higher, especially among female voters in the elderly and younger – 18-29 years – who rarely vote, despite not being able to like the President."
Even before Ford’s public charges of sexual abuse of the aforementioned majority had been noted by analysts that it could provide a backlog if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become worse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, in the beginning of the last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final outcome, or about Kavanaugh being held responsible; it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have treated it," points out Guy Cecil, who is president of Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in their election – to the press channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views about who they should believe in according to the statements made by Ford and Kavanaugh, where the last names have a little more on their side.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony statement in full certainty or in principle, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh in full certainty or in principle.
In addition, 38 % said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either reasonable or completely reliable in his testimony, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
Following the invitation from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the charges made by Ford and at least one other, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's decision last week that Kavanaugh was completely wrong with her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the guest-named show her sexes to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The finder of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The finder of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launchs a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee was shocked that the plan with Inrupt is "world rulers".
"We'll have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is, as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique in the personal online data collection is that it is absolutely up to the user to determine who can provide the specific information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s managing director, John Bruce, is to collect resources, processes and ability to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
This week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the available tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team do not talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they are going to change it completely, so that all of their business models are suddenly overloaded."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a media storage on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called network neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the director and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrated recipients of the Victoria Corps from World War I were captured
The only priest of the English church who won the Victoria Corps by fighting during World War I will be celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wan were baptized on September 29, 1918, during the attack by Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
But he was killed four days later by a gunman and never knew he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, at least one of his two children was discovered by a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his children, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic", that the stone was discovered 100 years after his best-selling company.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick train and under severe protection from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people with the "greatest man's resistance" before he alone attacked an artylized and unharmed three cannons.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German snowguard on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann of 72 said that his best father's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me shy."
He and his brother James Vann also built a branch after the parade that was announced by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very upset about participating in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underlines the true opposite."
MMA fans went up all night to see Bellator 206, but got instead Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the stard Bellator 206 and then you'll be denied to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald made it possible to meet each other, the sights in England were surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were uncompromising after they had kept awake until early in the morning for just this fight.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a child pornography film as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, why they were required to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, President of Bellator's senior office when he was asked about the issue.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said that they would work to include English sails in the planning ahead.
"When you think about the resend, I think we can get it to work," said Coker.
"But the clock is six Sunday morning over there, and we don't find a solution to it before Sunday's time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when I was transferred, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friends.
We tried to repair it, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're getting up with five fights instead of six, which we normally do, we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minimum value" over sexuality
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says that he felt less valuable than everyone else in his upbringing, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it didn't go up to him before he came into the larger classes, that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give other "hope."
He also said he went down to win OL after being a parent.
The usual event on the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to help you.
Daley was a guest in Lavernes' first program and said that he felt "lower value" than everyone else in his upbringing, because "it was not socially accepted to be able to like boys and girls."
He said: "From now on, the feelings of being remembered and feeling differently have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't scare everyone when they learned his sexuality to know.
The double Olympic Bronze Winner has become a highly proficient LGBT champion and used its participation this year's Commonpeace Games in Australia to appeal for a criminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live openly without negative consequences, and he would give other "hopes".
The third world champion said that he had been "surprised" when he joined a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but told him that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it is difficult to find anyone on the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much in such a young age – he took his first OL as 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspectives" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about if I'd win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 for 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told him that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had received photos to London 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there by that time.
I held his hand when his air strike stopped, and it came up first to me that he wasn't immortal when he stopped pulling the wind and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 OL and water bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamt of all my life – to dig before a local audience at OL. There was nothing that could hurt the feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first selection of songs – Proud of Heather Small – which had been very significant during the reception of the OL and still gave him a ghastly hat.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unscarp Mickelson on the back of Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson records on Sunday when he plays his 47th fight in Ryder Cup, but he's going to do something in the form if it's not to be a sad lover.
Mickelson, who records for 12 times to be involved in competition, which is suspended every 2 years, was placed on the bank of Captain Jim Furyk, a day's four ball and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the U.S. events as usual, the five-year-old great-grandfather had to get up and play his game in the hope of getting up on the skis.
Although not at the top of the career, he had the most direct drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the train at Le Golf National, where the long race often penalizes wildfares.
And if the route wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet at the ninth battle on Sunday the very precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has fought with novelist Tommy Fleetwood to win all four battles this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single campers start strong, Mickelson's fight can be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his chamber.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a beating on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these before – and also this week.
I didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I assumed he would play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it would be.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldos beat record for most played games in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to measure itself with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 subordinates and seven independents, even though Furyk said his presence contributes with something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's shaky, smart, he can like to get to people, and he's good to have in the bedroom," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had it funny to play against him this week, which was funny to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great action can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn, by experience, that a strong action before the last day of Ryder Cups singles can quickly become nervous.
The dancer held in 1997 in Valderrama, where a section led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point blast over the Americans, but was just getting caught before the target of a victory of 141⁄2-131/2.
"You will be remembering yourself that we had a fine operation in Valderrama, we had a fine operation in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just had precisely water," says Bjørn after having seen the 2018-holding win both 5-3 Fridays and last year to a total operation of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's got to be full of shit tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it is to try to win the trophies, and that is where our focus lies.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Enlightened over his performances on a hard road added Björn: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that counts, and that's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters like golf games.
That's what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, because he must also get the best out of himself."
On the other hand, it appears to the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partnership with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who has won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced converges on the last day. First of all, at the win in Brooklyn, before he died, when Europe created the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he said, when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had talked to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brooklyn, as you saw at Medinah.
When the moment has come to an end, it puts a great pressure on the games.
We combine our position in relation to it and put the players on the path in the order we feel for. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to try to lead the back seat and stand for Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other European players in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group players in this order, because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship was re-examined
The latest German fleet would have stood ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war, but the Germans must wait for at least one year for the reason of technical problems and a rising price, writing local media.
The introduction of the largest ship in the entire new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is due to the first half of 2019, according to the Di Zeit report, which quotes a man from the military.
The ship would have become part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have afflicted the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which were ordered back in 2007, shall replace the old frigates from the Bremen-class.
If they are aware that they will have a strong cannon, a large selection of anti-aircraft and anti-ships missiles as well as stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it would be possible to have the fries removed from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which, to say, will get Germany to appear as an overarching power factor – will already be a parent when they are attacked, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125-frequency created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship in use and returned it to the Bloom & Voss Warfare in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of decisive "software and hardware failures", which made the warship unusable in fighting situations.
Software error was of particular importance since the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be managed by a crew of 120 men – that is only half of the crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the fleet for future updates.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failure, the price of the project, which includes training of men, is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion (3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates will become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's flagship forces are breaking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running dry for the clear ship."
The employer said that the problem has been raised over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the prisoners from the Baden-Wuertmenberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Snitches to the Secret Life of Flags Museums
New research from a region in Scotland is trying to discover how flagermus uses the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique, flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is carried out by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows the common flamermus, door Flagermus, long flamermus and waterflagerism at Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment is located in carefully selected locations in the area to include the activities of the flag-Museums during the season.
Data from NTS staff and volunteers will also be collected using hand-held detectors.
Deeper analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the flamer muscles and show what kind of it does.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Natural conservation consultants for NTS Rob Dewar hope that the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of conservation efforts, such as the establishment of nests, and the best way to store forest areas for flangermus and similar species.
The number of flags in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and construction projects that affect the mountains and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can be true of rivers, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
Flagermus is not really blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced eco-calculation technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important ports and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flagermus very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect teams, and sometimes perform rescue actions.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated flag-mouse reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's flag-museries.
The owner of the region, David Thompson, says that it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for flagermus," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot, you don't know about flagermus, so the work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to be fed."
He underlines the importance of looking after flamermus before making maintenance tasks on property, since the destruction of a single reason can kill up to 400 dogs and young people.
Flagermus is peaceful, and it is illegal to kill, generate or disrupt them or their row.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader for Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to hand along.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flamingo, and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the population develops."
Ronaldo rejects violent complaints, while lawyers ask German journal
Christian Ronaldo has called him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers make it clear to the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been charged with the rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the claims were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-double winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate The Spiegel because of the charges they have called Reuters "an inexhaustible publication of suspects about private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral crime in a class corresponding to the charge, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly took back to the player's room, where he had to rape her orally according to the report delivered at Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "the one percent".
The paper claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they agreed to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got the photographed damage to a hospital, but later she went to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fucking for revenge" and worried about becoming "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now saying that she will negotiate the agreement, since she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo stood in front of a change from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event would have taken place, and changed in summer to the Italian castle Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
The UK "will always regret it" if it lost its status as a leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "an alarming" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production to the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK flows out of the EU by the end of March," said the managing director of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on trade across the border.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of an expiry of an agreement.
Toyotas production runs on a strict schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which, according to the automobile industry, could lead to delays and loss of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's production in the Derbyshire factory, and then the production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "consumed so that these expectations are precisely ignored at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The opinion of Toyota and other manufacturers points out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would have stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the company, says that his members become more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again."
One speaker for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says The White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can "keep spending a week more", as the final round of the holiday named Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller in his investigation of Russian electoral mix, links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to the course of the court.
Whether Trump will be four of the local minister of justice and thus risk Mueller's independence, he has been a soldier in Washington a month.
Earlier this month, New York Times wrote that Rosenstein considered carrying a microphone to hold talks with Trump and the opportunity to appoint the President through paragraph 25.
Rosenstein promised the news.
But on the last day, he went to the White House, and he said, "Come up!"
Instead, we agreed to a Thursday meeting with Trump, which was currently in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "not prefer" to four Rosensteins, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a meeting with the Senate's decision-making board, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked to meet Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be taken a week with everything going on in the high school.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The room Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added: "I'm not inconceivable that they play up to the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President takes more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding, without quoting a source: "We have seen the figures."
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, it is definitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to give you a rich chance for that, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often deals with questions when leaving the White House or participating in open hearings or press meetings with high-end guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure before the present journalists.
Health Ministers contact EU health workers in Scotland after Brexit concerns
The Ministry of Health has written to the EU-level staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to be after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than a half years before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its dedicated public sector.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continue, and it seems that decisions are expected to be made this afternoon.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for a Brexit, if any, without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the effort that each worker has done, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve the work of health care for patients and the local community.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to be.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after major injury
Linebacks from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a major damage in the 31-27 day of hearing to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports from Tennessee Mike Organ.
First trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the side line and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oil on the side line before they placed him on a bar and brought him into further investigation.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombies operation on the Waterbilt Medical Center was overstated.
Harris added that there is no "no details about the type or extent of the damage yet," and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he recovered the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for another year and is running with his first season in Tennessee State after a change from Illinois.
He had five thanks on Saturday, before he left the fight, which gives him 18 thanks throughout this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp fees when they buy houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are required to pay higher stamp fees when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. The extra money is to help the non-residents, according to the conservative party.
This draw must be measured by the success of Corbins in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp fee will cover those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to get £120 million a year for homeless people.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when they buy properties in the United Kingdom for the benefit of the homeless.
The drawing will be regarded as a test of a response to Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper dwellings and following them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will cover persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The service from here must be used to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The extra fee imposed above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-house shopping and buying for rent may reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "speech towns" such as the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal will only be made a week after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp fee in order to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He charged large construction and plant companies to keep their property prices up by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop the allowances on cheap dwellings to solve the "failure situation" of the United Kingdom.
Corbyn has proposed an eye-opening series of housing reforms, including the control of household prices and the withdrawal of the customer’s ability to put people on the road if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the opportunity to conduct public housing.
May said: "In the first year, I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life would be better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be said that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy dwellings such as hard workers.
For all too many are dreaming that a home has become too far away, and the uncertainty of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's trainer"
The Head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's trainer.
The stock of 42 enjoys the challenge of reinvigorating the club from the North East, which now has three places in League One, three points from the top.
He changed to the Stadium of Light in summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country that's playing.
"I played a fight with the B-hold, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always stuck in me.
However, the possibility would only arise if I had success in training clubs."
The founder of Ross' training for Sunderland is Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says he had no responsibility to follow such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure successfully from, if I can get this club back in Premier League."
Out of the structure and facilities of this club, it is perfectly home in Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple task, but I'll probably just see myself as successful here, if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career that trains after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart Train Station.
Then he helped Alloa to come back after being pushed down in the third best order and transformed St. Mirren from the pressure structure to the title winner of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more adaptable now than he ever did during his careers that are playing for Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was quite a different way," he recalls about the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that the training was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I made it nice, served wisely and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still some kind of stress and pressure training, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I haven't had it any more pleasant with myself in my adult life."
You can hear the entire interview on Sports Sound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.

This summer's ice cream has increased the performance of England's pubs, but it has set restaurant trees under greater pressure.
The sale on pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has gone down 4,8%, shows numbers.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA and has collected the figures, said: "In addition to sunskin and England's unexpected long VM, it has meant that July follows June's pattern, where the pubs experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are now severely affected.
The loss of 1.8 % in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubbers and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages made it clear best and experienced progress similar to the return of restaurants.
Pubbers with focus on food lay in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It looks like people just want to have something to drink.
On the cross by pubs and barcodes, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 % per month, while the food dropped by 3.3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to selling out-of-home markets, the weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants continue to fight, despite a fall in sales of 4.8% years after year, to cause real harm to the above-mentioned costs.
The long warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will give a hard-pressed poster."
The total increase in sales total for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales tables for English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than $9 billion, and they are leading in the area.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide for their parents.
Every fifth child – up to 11 years of age – has a secret account of social media that they hide from their parents and teachers shows research.
A study of 20,000 students in class 4-9 reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual harassment
20 % of students said they have a "head account" that they can show their parents
Every five children under the age of 11 creates accounts on the social media that they hide for adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the 4th class reveals violent growth in the "false Insta" account – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual harassment.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they are also private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, then a teenager who called on others to "to rape me".
The study carried out by the UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference for Private Schools (HMC) found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, of which half agreed to have a private account.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are ready to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilid Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletes, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who make sports decisions to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilid enjoys great consideration in the Atlantic world in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will be able to benefit from her in the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help draw out a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American, who watered two of its four OL gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre courses at OL in Atlanta in 1996, and who is now often a commentator for BBC, could not go after a transitional ischemic accident.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by an accident.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show me if I wanted to get up there and how much.
It's been hard work, but I'm very fast, I've learned to go back and do agile exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!
Advertising for breast pumps, comparing mothers with dogs, gets mixed reception online
A breast-feeding company has shared the views online with a advertising that compares large-scale mothers with dogs that are being slaughtered.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first wireless bridge pump", the technology consumer gas has issued a sarcastic video-inspired advertising to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cosal that's filled with hoe, to a song where it sounds like, "Yes, I'm painting myself, but you don't see any hell" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's not over here, it's my breasts."
The environment sounds like, "pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I paint my baby."
But the advertising that has been published on the company's Facebook page has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes sense with the "dears" at the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.

Another wrote: "Of course enough traumatizing for both mother and child.
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise for a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
And another added, "I'm going to make an insensitive advertising."
A woman admitted that she seemed to be, the song was "unbelieving mother."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still wrong, I'd have had one.
Aming made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a bit of a joke, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertising directed against mothers who pumping milk (on their workplace or on toilets) and feels like 'köer'.
It is not a advertising that exposes or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women discover that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bags.
The concept behind the advertising is based on that many women there say that they feel like dogs.
The pump from Elvie is completely soundless, has no pipes or rings and fits the disk in an amme-bow, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, who is a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a pleasant and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel between common mothers and milk cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast-feeding, unless we demonstrated in a consistent and well-known way the freedom the new pump could give."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Martha Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred migrant children in secret moved to telly by Texas border
The number of abandoned migrant children has been exploited, although the number of border guards has not changed. This is partly due to a stronger retort and the Trump administration’s rapper law, which makes it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to be in the country by standing up and taking action against a child.
The risk of sending home increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking employee at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress and told them that they had held several persons seeking to sponsor innocent minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had clear criminal certificates.
"At least 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing the people," said Albence.
In an attempt to address children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within a month after their withdrawal.
Many use video calls instead of themselves to meet up and talk about their case for legal residence in an immigration court.
Those who are judged unworthy to stay are deported quickly.
The longer the children become aware, the higher the likelihood that they will get the fear or depression that may lead to violent accidents or flight trials, it will be heard by the auxiliary workers and in reports from the system in recent months.
People who advocate better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on a child suffering.
They added that moving to a town without mental preparation or the possibility of saying good-bye to friends can bring up dreams that many already struggle with.
Syria informs the US, French and Turkish 'inspired forces' that they should withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moulalem, also Vice-Minister of the Prime Minister, said that the residence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the threat of combating terrorism, and they will "keep meeting with similar means."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that the war against terror "the nearest is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been around since 2011 and millions have fled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all the Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the flight area, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to be able to return home, after which he charged "some Western countries" to "spread unreasonably fear", which made the refugees leave.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these messages," he said.
"They policy on what would be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that aid will not be made available to rebuild the country before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major powered by Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The basis for the agreement between Russia and Turkey was to avoid a major attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million people live.
However, Moulalem stressed that the agreement had "clearer deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions would follow Jihads from the Nusrafront, an exploding group of Al-Qaeda, which "will be eliminated".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call on the new Committee's first meetings to clarify a post-war constitution for Syria and the path to a election.
Moualem has provided conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and has said that the work of the panel should be limited to "examine the legislation in the present constitution", and warned against mixing.
That's why Trump wins another presidential period.
From the logic, Trump is gradually re-elected in 2020, unless the rule of law and the scandals conclude his presidential period before time, which many liberals hope for.
In what is undoubtedly the most dramatic conclusion of a presidential period ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of certility.
Since 2014, the number of certifiers in the best transmission period has been nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million sails in the best shipping time compared to 1.7 million sails four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most sails up to 3.5 million on evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, leading the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet, who becomes the president after an attack destroys the convention building.
Nell Scowell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he wanted to vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Before he gets me to cry,' said Scowell.
Caosset has maintenance value.
However, contrary to all other television programs, the stories from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged fortification.
And yet it's more about being informed of citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "dub background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's extradite leather jacket to $15,000 ("dressed with hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' living descriptions of Trump's anatomism.
Anyway, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump-showet's rotating crew and daily surprises (snakes with N.F.L., rose to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you're missing a section, you're off.
When I got caught this week in Fleiss, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC until he got CNN.
He could not go on his own; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate's decision, and the future of the Supreme Court would be decided.
"I can remember when we made all these shows before the time, and people said, 'It's the beginning of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums lead to the close midway selection of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17 district receives large sums of money, as a result of a comparison of two "Congressional Districts" fighting two members of the convention on the same seat.
This newly converted urban district in Pittsburgh creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who has already sat in another special election last year.
Lamb stands against another last member of the Congress, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very much embroiled with the new 17.
The Courts were re-confirmed, according to the Pennsylvania High Court in January, that the old district was legally established in the favor of the Republicans.
The fight on the new 17th district has started a fight on economic resources between the major parties' committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a high surveillance election in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump watered the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for aid to China, but refused
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners sent Trumps management.
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the foreign ministry's speechwoman in a previous month.
But it was only El Salvador, which was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include compensation for economic aid and restrictions on admissions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and mortality statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials issued a summit on security and economic development, which would continue to be the last year's meeting that was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top-men made it clear that they wanted to have the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the views on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal on the importance of the American meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict requirements or sanctions from Washington.
A speaker for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to discuss the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an inexplicable analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke of anonymity condition.
History
The next obstacle could very well be the special complainant Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the research, which has considerable and publicly available evidence.
After saying this, Mueller will also direct his research on the question of whether Trump’s campaign was secretly working with Russia on the attack on the election.
If the Congress were to come into new hands, Trump would probably be held responsible while he was preparing to meet the voters again and in time a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump is inexhaustible – and the same applies to his opponents in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to enter a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed.
It is about such points of view that the axis of history runs, and the independent march of democracy to and from.
In the United States, there are now too many of these points.
What do we do if Trump fears the man who decides the future of Mueller's research, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosensstein's seat has been hot since the current paper could announce that he had proposed to make secret records of the president and to establish his ownership of the oath.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is accurate.
"How do we react if the newly requested research by the F.B.I. is set up or not carried out properly – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court in spite of credible complaints about sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the Central Committee for a convention that will keep Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I think we can do it.
My mother was a Czech Orthodox Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, which once occupied my ambassador's country.
She survived, immigrated to America, and then sent me 60 years later to put up with the flag salute on the table.
How can I be different than optimistic with that in the bag?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers will take on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have a victory against the Austrians to come forward from the Group G of Europe League.
A knifeed middleman, Graham Dorrans, prevented him from having a sex before the 2nd fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jump board for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good hold," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the faith that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but everything was quite a good result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and was the best.
On Thursday, there will be another big European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be hard because they have a good outcome in the final battle, but with the public behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the vote is good now.
The wood is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study’s participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be accommodated, only a few were talking to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the National Wide Research said they discussed the costs of long-term work with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the United Nations Life Insurance Company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for taking care of yourself if you don’t have time to tell them about your wishes.
Use your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive benefits. These options can be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term loans can be financed, among other things, by means of traditional long-term insurance, cash-payment insurance or self-insurance with your own resources – as long as you have the economy.
Get the legal documents set up: take the legal battles in the course of the proceedings.
Get a complete handout so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and medical personnel comply with your wishes, if you cannot communicate on your own.
Consider, too, an economic authority.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make economic decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Suppose one of your elderly parents needs medical help and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It is not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
A man killed several times with air raids in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air raid on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, in the middle and hand.
The agent describes the shooting, which took place about 02.30, as "very random."
The victim didn't see the man.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call witnesses to stand up.
Land mines and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency relief workers have not been able to receive information from Donghea, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donghea, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located in the heart of a small bug on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated 40 years of jubilee when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donghea is a county located over 300 km east of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population rate of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the key players in the Central Sulawesi economy, particularly in the coastal area of Dongäa.
Nickel invention is also important in the province, but finds a major place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodgaa have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred homes in Donghea.
In 1996, Donghea was again struck by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismologically at the so-called volcanic eruption in the Pacific and is regularly covered by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which hit 14 countries and killed 26,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of mighty earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake measuring 6,8 struck southern Java, Indonesia's nearest population island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying thousands of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya account in Aceh and spread destruction and panic, when the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not released this time, but more than 100 were killed by the combined buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's oldest son, the intention of violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Vasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspected of violence in the home, preventing the notification of violence in the home and in order to oppose detention, according to the report sent by Alaska State Troops on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is the brand-new prisoner in Mat-Su Pretreal Facility with a rent of 500 dollars without security, KTUU reports.
He was appointed for the hearing day, where he declared himself "very innocent," reports the network.
Palin is targeted for three Class A violations, which can lead to a prison accident up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a Class B infringement, which can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been targeted for violations of law.
In December 2017 he was charged with having betrayed his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the incident.
The case is currently under treatment at the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was meant to be violent at home to prevent the notification of a violent crime in the home and the possession of weapons in the affected state of the event.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a shot in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary groups after explaining his son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his holding in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people have arrived, after an earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed several hundred homes.
The region is without electricity and communication, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck south of the central Sulawesi, which is north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that currently show where the ground is covered.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get a terrorist in NYC guilty of the rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to prosecute the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was finally punished for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov used a rental car from the building market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike trip along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where footmen and bicycles who came in the way were killed.
On the basis of the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "suspendly" killed the eight victims and "simply" causing serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intentional death penalty in New York's southern district.
According to the legal document, death penalty is a possible result of both of these purposes.
A number of weeks after the attack, a government jury could present Saipov for an agreement of 22 points. There were eight complaints of murder in connection with gangs, which were typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a complaint on the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "abstaining planning and preparations", the prosecutors said and described Saipov's execution as "severe, inhuman and degrading."
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, physical damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," says the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last visited a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up in a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was finally executed in a state case in New York in 1953, and the marriage was executed after being sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg parquet was held in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and published according to the legal documents no sign of the attacks in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he had done well with his actions.
According to the complaint, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be attached to his hospital room, told the officials.
He has refused to appear guilty in the 22nd paragraph of the complaint.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course shocked" by the complainants' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept an admission and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's hair" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians had to be able to "mark the press" from the Eurosceptors – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The MEP, Peter Bone, pointed out to the demonstration in Birmingham that the UK would have "be out now", if Farage had been Brexit dealers.
May's challenge in creating a collection in the deeply split party is stressed by conservative remaining participants in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track under attack by both Brexitiers, permanentists and the EU.
Her ally insists that despite her return, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and thereby force the Eurosceptors and Laborour to choose between her package or "kaos".
To demonstrate Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone told him he wanted to shoot the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage would have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we will shoot Chequers."
On the basis of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight for the world to be inferior to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Both said that the public's attitude would have changed since the vote in 2016: "The British people would have changed their mind and would like to be in the EU is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns was also for the demonstration and told the journalists: "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopulated in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Get up now, Chequers, and start listening.'
As a comment to May, she added: "The Prime Minister keeps their job when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians should be able to "mark the press" if they fail to take the decision from the 2016 vote.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will advise Brexit, but we are assembled to tell them that we will not let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must ensure that the political class, which is on the march to deliver Brexit, can mark the press.
"We mobilize the people here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we do not stop before we become independent, self-government and proud of Britain."
I've been marching through Birmingham before a totime took over the town.
Exploded activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Working colleague Lord Adonis had done before the meeting with security problems with the conservative party apps.
"It is the people who claim to have control over the IT systems and technology for Canada, border controls, free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's totally green.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
The Warren's "inspiredly" to stand up to the President's election
Member of the House of Representatives, Senator Elizabeth Warren, is "promoting strongly to stand up to the presidential committee" after the mid-term committee in November.
According to Boston Globe, the democracy of Massachusetts spoke about its future during a conference in Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, should try to win a re-election against the Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Tromps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
You've been speculating if she wanted to challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the council hall, since Trump took over the embezzlement.
One participant asked her if she was planning to join the presidential committee.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Suspension in cases of shock at LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that on Friday a suspect was arrested for the shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and killed by the injuries," said police leader Murphy J. Paul according to media 247sports.
Wayde went in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was cut off and helped to be present, owned by a gun and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-metre high-three-year-old student, who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played in average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's great prize: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world championship, following team orders gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role in the course.
From the driving position, Bottas received a good start and was close to raising Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two swings and invited Vettel to attack his chamber.
Vettel drove in stone as the first one, and stopped Hamilton to fight the trafficiest in the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car went in and out of Vettel a little later, but Hamilton came back before, when the Ferrari driver had to leave the entrance for a double defense at the third wheel.
Max Verstappen started from the top row and was number seven after the first round of his 21-year-old birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the course when he refused to move the roof to take Kimi Raikkon's fourth place.
He had to go to Pitt on the 44th floor, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkon secures the fourth floor.
"It's a hard day, because Valtteri did it great all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me through.
The team did an amazing job to secure us both first and second," Hamilton said.
A really bad body language
President Donald Trump spoke to Senator Diane Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday, because she insisted that she had not taken the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who charged the high school-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the American Senate decision, but said instead that the events in the Senate showed that people were "unsanitary and hostile and unfair".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's happened the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and hostile and unjust," he said.
"When you look at opinions and doctors, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Can you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who relieved it?
Remember her answer... it was you who cut the document-- "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't cured anything."
Hov, just a minute.
No, we haven't done anything," he added in a comparison with the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter of Ford’s charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was received earlier in September – but Feinstein said that the doctor came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't healed her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I've done it."
But her speech was not well received by the president, who said during the hearing day: "I tell you it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While the President continued to defend the designated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats used the charges to render their own case.
"They have no means in their efforts to take power back.
You can see the wickedness, the opposites, they are equal to who they are to blame for getting power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars mod Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday's losing Elite League match against Belfast Giant by winning the 5-3 return battle in Dundee in Saturday.
Giantes quickly came forward with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compared on the way home before Dwyer brought Giants back.
Francois Bouchard compared to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third floor of the season by Elite League for Adam Keef's team, who came from behind to fight Dundee 2-1 in the war of Friday in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides where Ginants went out as masters in the three previous battles.
Dwyer appeared in four minutes at 3:35 from a assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant, when Beauvilleer doubled the action four minutes later.
In a tragic first period, Sullivan brought the house back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownies' equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giant came forward at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The housekeeper regrouped, and Bouchard compared again with a great goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked to help Nielsen lead the Dundee for the first time in the war late in the second period, and he ensured the victory with his fifth goal through the last period.
Giants, who has now lost four out of their five battles, is home in Milton Keynes to their next fight on Friday.
Aeroplanes died to ensure that hundreds of passengers avoided land mines
A pilot in Indonesia was completely captured after he died to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake in Friday hit the Sulawesi island and dissolved a tsunami.
Powerful persecution still prevails in the area, and many have been captured in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agungs fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the weak control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was returned to his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held on the start-point, came safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was working together.
He died in the hospital later.
Talsman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said according to the Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan, which would take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him in the morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We're sundry," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach tens of thousands, and the country’s disaster preparedness reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donghara, Sigi and Boutong.
"Death is expected to rise, because there are still many equal in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which contains a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial flights fly emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more equality.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the shops are packed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to do.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask all of you to work around the day to perform all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Flights in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the flight in the garage
The flight crew behind the plane that landed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though he had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the flying plane.
According to a press release Air Niugini, the afternoon was unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline is not returned to requests for more information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Locals were involved in saving the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water during landing in the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The officer said on Friday that seven people were in the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers were at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the government and the exact order of events.
The U.S. and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane landed in the bay before the landing route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying across the landline.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed in very low water.
"That was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go to life to get to the emergency exits on the floating plane.
He said that the crew was panicking and screaming and that he had had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Marines said that sailers who worked to renovate a shark in the vicinity also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to catch people in the country before flying at about 30 meters deep.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyticals determine the time line for the night in which a woman was burned alive
The complainants concluded their evidence on the hearing of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts in the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as expert in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecoms to compile the 29-year-old prosecutor Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claim, writes The Clarion Ledge.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that he and his friend Michael Sanford visited police.
Sanford sat in the witness center on Saturday and told him he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was true, when he said he was in Sanford's truck tonight, Sanford said he said "good because my car was in Nashville."
Another argument was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they only knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that at a time after Chambers' death Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence is intended to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hippie?
A hipoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hipop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hippie popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revision in the United Kingdom because of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
You're still a black person?
Children’s Picture in New York seeking a couple after dating with "racistic" SMS
A child girl in New York claims a couple of discriminatory boyfriends after having sent a text message to a mother who complained that she was "again a black person".
The Parthet said they were racist, but compared to the search target with "repression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is mother to two, expressed his habit of finding out that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, NO ONE AND SORT PERSON," wrote Plato-Flaxman to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, she made the "fucking" plastic-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former children, such as African-American, had been bad for her work, and that she instead expected a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her work one day and sent home to an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice pleads for compensation for the driver and compensation for $350 a day in the six months where she would have stayed with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't allow yourself to do this," she said to the judge on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The Parthe has defended themselves with the fact that they are not racists and that Maurice’s fear was justified because they were afraid that they would not trust her after having insulted her.
"My wife was here to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you transfer your children to someone you had been unnecessary to, even though it was a mistake?
This baby?
It's very honest."
Plastic compared the search target to "repression", and that his wife had been born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really looking for someone like that?
It is not particularly friendly," the investment consultant added.
Although the case is still under way, the Court of Human Rights has already signed the debate on social media and condemned their conduct and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's proposal feared that readers could not relate to a number of bears
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was written for release, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was released.
It's really funny to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC, before being inspired to write the book of children about a small train, would have been optimistic, even though his story had been rejected, and that the 60th year for the release of the books was "bitched" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all information was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't hesitate to speak," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost as if you had a child who gained something: you're proud of them, even though it's not your reward.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Telled colour to dying daughters over the phone
After the earthquake, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called with usual rooms to say that it was really bad, and that she didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes, and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart running was slowly losing their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to take me together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I shook my head, and the tears began to run.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Surgeoning women try to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost their lives in suicide attempt to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bro with inspiring messages and telephone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got a depression, and 18, when he started killing himself.
"I don't want any parents to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said that his smile looked like a room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was really sick.
In 2014 it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people there's someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you need to talk to anyone."
Sharon Davis' many-year-old friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about that he was sorry or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before July he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he never had contact with them."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to come through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
That's what we've been through.
But we all have to go on and fight together."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear while the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked about – a limited time-limited study with limited scope – we might have a small consensus," Fleke said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee "lost from the back" was in the middle of the fixed party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI conducted their investigation?
Their resistance was due to fear.
The midway committees are only five weeks away on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as they expect, seem to be poor, they will be weak in their efforts to get the man they wish to have chosen to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thus met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote on this afternoon, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the afternoon, which would give Vice-President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the highest position.
The number of North Korean 'falder' in Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean contractors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean law.
Park Byeong-Seug referred to data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea and said there were 1.127 over the last year compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human mobility were contributing to the changing numbers.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In the long run, most refugees from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea at the time.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of the refugees across China, who have the longest border crossings to North Korea, and who are easier to cross than the highly forced demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the refugees to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced to leave their homes.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still in war – has been significantly improved over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to discuss the stranded nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against an atom-free Korea at a global level.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong-ho gave American sanctions due to the lack of progress.
"In the United States there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will lean on our own hands," Ri said in a talk to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh for "hissterical" and says he's not at the top.
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is appointed to the Supreme Court, for "histerical" and said that his temperature was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comment came in an interview on Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, she would have been called hysterically," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's decision-making committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the charges that he had committed sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him "great and coordinated against" organized by the left-wing fleet, which was angry that Hillary Clinton did not water the president's post in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the upper room because it showed that he was President of the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with the opinions and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi fought without being asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a power if he was confirmed and if the Democrats get more in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he does not speak the truth about Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but specifically in the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or the abortion of Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer the question of whether he would make certain previous high school decisions.
"It doesn't have to happen that a hysterical, privileged person will fight a job as judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just nice'," said Pelosi.
And women need to use it.
It's a fair outcome, a few months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
She continued: "I got a great surprise from a woman who was the boss who said that she was also crying when she became angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just got to know.
And I thought it was great."
Tartars are permitted as an expression of anger, partly because they are in the bond and are misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of one of my first jobs in an office with a weight of men, where I often grew angry, where I was taken by the neck of an elderly woman – a cold boss, who I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the track.
"You must never let them see that you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're racist.
They will believe that you're sorry about it, and they'll be glad they got your back."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to have a business on a boat named Monkey Business and caught himself as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could stand as well as herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a particularly thought-out decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the course, and they definitely didn't need another candidate anymore.
Some called it the Snow White and the Seven Gates."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind fundraiser, so she promised that she would not participate unless she collected $2 million.
The sword was lost in front of us.
She discovered that some of her support, which gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they believe I'm being kidnapped?" she thought.
When she said that she would not stand up, she was overcome by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to travel money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her neck.
"I could believe I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press responded to her.
"I'd think I was sponsored by Kleineex.
I remember thinking what's going to be written on my grave?
"She cried"?
Such a trade war between the United States and China can be a benefit to Beijing
The opening balances in the US-China trade war were high, and even though the hit from far beyond can be a benefit for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The US President Donald Trump rejected the first tip of notice earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week's largest escalation of new customs duties affecting goods of a value of 200 billion dollars applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States of China.
Beijing has made a difference every time, at least by placing a duty rate of 5-10 % on US goods for $60 billion.
China has struggled to follow the whole way of the United States, and probably the world's world's closest economy does not seem to be at the same point in time.
If it gets Washington to get his demands back, it means they're giving up, but for China's president, Xi Jinping will be too hard to bid for the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its shorts correctly, the US pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a groove for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research workers focusing on Asia's thinking Center for New American Security.
Syria's ready to receive refugees, Foreign Minister thinks
Syria says it is clear that the refugees can return and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by the war for more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and certainly thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore normal status.
All circumstances now exist to allow the refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily life and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have been fled from the country since 2011, where the war began.
More than six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government wanted to help rebuild the conquered country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that were helping to support the strike.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup-Seir in Paris
The European hold has won Ryder Cup 2018 and hit the American hold 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National without Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe turned back, when Captain Thomas Björn's detention reached the 14.5 points, which required the US to strike.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard in most of the tournament, threw his drive into the sea on a couple of 3 to 16 wheels, which made him lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari was well finished in all rounds and became 1 out of all 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjörn Olesen.
Paragraph 1 of the World War II, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the bagagen, Spain Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry normally, but today I can't do it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get the trophies back.
It is a standstill, and I am glad that I could help," said a sensitive lady named Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the case to his countryman John Ram, who landed the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single night.
"I'm incredibly proud of having killed Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It is a play statistics for one of the best golfers ever who has won 14 great titles, just passed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems finding the form with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his pleasant revelation, "I'm proud of the gods, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time in the morning when we gave Europe a chance.
You're lost.
The hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we will proceed.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to make it easy on your hair.
We were wounded."
