Last week, the drama "Purity Private Food" was temporarily interrupted, and a heated discussion on the profuseity rate of the country was triggered.
Civil Rights Group issued a travel warning against the state of Misuri
As a result of discriminatory policies and racist attacks in the state of Missouri, the American Association for the Promotion of Coloring (NAACP) issued a travel warning to the colored groups ready to travel to the state of Missouri.
"NACP, which entered into force on 28 August 2017, called for a series of suspicious racial events in Misuri, all non-ethnic tourists, visitors and people in Misuri to pay particular attention and take a very careful approach when travelling in Misuri state," the Group declared.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of the laws of the State of Missouri made it more difficult for people to overcome discrimination, and that the law of the State of enforcement had a certain degree of influence on minority groups, which led to the publication of travel warnings by the organization.
The violations of civil rights are taking place on people's faces.
The Kansas City Star reported: "The Kansas City Star, President of NaaCP, in Missouri, was beaten or killed for the sake of color.
"We've received a lot of complaints, a lot of what we didn't have before."
This is the first such warning published in the United States against a state.
The organization called for the deaths of a man named Toli Sandes, 28-year-old black students at the University of Missouri.
This year, Sanders died in an inconspicuous state of Missouri, where he spent fuel on a trip to the state of Missouri and was detained by the police in the state of Missouri without charge of crime.
It also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the State of Missouri showed that "the possibility of a 75 per cent stop-load of vehicles in the country is higher than the white man."
Chapel said: " The advice is to raise awareness of people and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in the state of Missouri. "
"People need to be prepared, whether to take the insurance money to the state of Missouri or to let relatives know of their travel within the state."
According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Hate Crime Report, the State of Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime rate, the State was registered in the country at paragraph 16.
Travel warnings are also a response to new laws in the state of Missouri, which will make the prosecution of housing or employment discrimination more difficult.
Earlier, the States of the United States adopted immigration law and requested the local law enforcement department to retain migrant offenders, the United States Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that it would increase the number of racial proceedings and disseminate travel advice to Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Government of the United States towards other countries, but in recent times, advisory groups have adopted this approach to address certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the “Golden Age” increased in 2015, the entire film market entered into a calm period in 2016 and the overall score of $440.69 million in the last year became a memory.
According to the data published by the National Statistical Office, in October the prices of new and double rooms in Beijing fell double, with only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.
The current European Union Technical Officer, Lupesko, made a technical report at this conference on the 2016 European Olympics and the recent European Championships.
BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city of hearts: to make the old man feel "live in the new era."
Referring to the news network on 18 January, the media reported that Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly becoming the modern attractive city of today.
The capital of China has high-speed Internet access, and there are border technologies such as facial recognition software, which have large-scale access to human labour wisdom and an invasive internationalization energy, which is one of the most exciting cities for foreign people who are searching for a spirit.
According to the British Broadcasting Company website on 16 January, German poet Clemens Seshi said: "If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere after that. "He refers to the song of singer Frank Sinatra Laun New York.
"If Sinatra lives today, he would probably sing a city like Beijing. "He says that living in this city will make you feel like living in a new age," he says.
He lived in England, but recently in Simon Noton, Beijing, published an article on the personal blog website 4Corners7Seas: "People generally have a sense of something big, but it's hard to say, but it has kept many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become, and they want to see firsthand evidence. "
It is reported that the high-speed Internet quality of this city and the environment of technical friendship make daily life easier than ever before.
Andy Penny Fuert, who is currently a subsidiary editor on the Beijing Children's website, says: "Beckin is moving rapidly into a cashless society, and the Internet integrates traditional money packages into a smart phone, making it easier for everyone to make a lot of transactions."
It is reported that, however, smart phones are only the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, and the face-to-face software has been widely identified, and many mobile applications have been used to carry out bank accounts and payments to access apartments and offices, even using them to verify the identity of the network driver.
Beijing has recently announced plans to expand the construction of a man-made scientific field of 138 billion people, which will then have 400 companies located there, focusing on the development of all kinds of man-made wisdom technologies that are designed from biodegradation to auto-pilot cars.
Food is also one of the most important social and economic days of China's history, and it is one of the most easy days for foreigners to participate in these festivals.
She says: "I suggest that I help Chinese friends prepare for the past year, clean the apartment and write the same red candle on the door of a new year's well-being, and that all family members will be able to gather together on the same day as on Friday, and then go to the middle of the night to welcome a new year with a bright fire. For foreign people, it is a real opportunity to have friends and family together tonight."
It is reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing is growing and growing, but Chinese language barriers and exchanges between foreigners are easily justified by their lack of full integration into local culture.
She says: "Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but their host country has almost no experience.
In these so-called "old outer bubbles" (the "old outer bubble" means that foreigners are mixed only among foreigners, but not with local and local cultures — translators — notes), foreign groups in their communities, food in the Western restaurant, and only foreigners in their friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little bit more simple -- it's easier than people might think.
She said: " The two hours a week in Chinese private schools or in the field of door learning should be suitable for each person's busy schedule. "
Whether a few regular words of study will also help with shopping, cooking at a restaurant or talking on a rental car.
It is reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years government efforts have addressed some problems.
Residents emphasized that it was important to get out of the house during the often cold months of pollution and to take those blue days as an opportunity to be in the midst of a long-standing drought or the search for a suitable day-to-day park.
Noton says: "Bekin is the most important city in China that can be found under the table, and you can find a good art and music, a pleasant night's life, a history, a more modern business area and an old cosmos."
It was reported that ageing was a major obstacle to human capital growth, particularly in the north-east region, with an annual contribution of 1.28 per cent to human capital growth.
The winner noted that the current risk of cross-border capital flows could be controlled, and that the fundamental factors of support for international income balance still exist for a long time.
On 17 December, the World of Beijing (New Zealand Journalist Haqqee) opened in the University of China on 17 December 2016 on 17 December, China's old-fashioned film about the restoration and protection of the International High Forum for the Protection of the People's Republic of China.
In April this year, the EU Commission accused Kong of pre-posting software, such as the Kongong Mobiles, and Chrome Browser, of not allowing it to use other Kongong applications.
The EU Commission considers this to be of the benefit of consumers and has prevented competition.
The EU supervisor first asked Kong to respond before 27 July.
If the names of the offenders are rejected, Kong is the highest of 10 per cent of its worldwide income, with approximately $74 million.
Kong has not yet evaluated it immediately.
Kong also faces EU investigations in the search resulting from its own procurement services.
The remains of the jungle are real, and it can be said that he's not an accident to achieve the "levels of the country" from the east to the west, and the extent of his flight is still surprising.
A picture of the legal status of Bitmond around the world.
Summary: In addition to the price recovery caused by the nature of the investment, the currency fluctuations of this round are also linked to the "resident" — the regulatory risk.
From the perspective of the perspective of the map, the attitudes of the Eastern countries to be more conservative than those of the Western world, and the countries of global sovereignty are still looking at the legitimacy of the digital currency, representing the "black-day risk".

With China, Korea and the EU's main market control, such as the battle against the Great Britain and the Great Depression, the world currency, which has been the leading currency, has been washed out since this week, and the second round of the price has broken down the total of $10,000, and has created the largest single date since three years.
In addition to the price of natural return caused by the investment, this number of currency fluctuations also have nothing to do with the long-standing "resident" — the risk of regulation.
In this important context, the large-scale data website HowMuch.net developed a map showing the legal status and degree of control of the currency in the countries of the world.
As shown in the following picture, the green representative of the legal market in bitumen; the middle market in yellow, although not publicly legitimised by the position of the coin, has no main use restrictions; the limited market in blue, that is, the local government's attempt to use the digital currency by means of red policy or regulation; the deep-white representative is defined as an illegal country; and the green is a country that has not yet been assessed.

The article noted that the distribution of the colour from the map of Central African Green shows that traditional Eastern countries are more protected from the attitudes of bitumen than those of the West.
Russia is now the largest country defined as the illegal one, China is one of the largest limited markets in the country, India is still unassessed and there is no one of the largest countries in the relevant policy.
North America and Western Europe are the highest-level areas of acceptance, that is, the distribution of greens is more focused.
The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America have been clearly differentiated, with the division of colors in the above areas more mixed.
Among them were Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil, the legitimate biter market, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, and a certain degree of restrictions on its trade and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet voted against Bitham.
The aggregate data above can be found that among the 246 countries statistics worldwide, there are 99 countries (or over 40 per cent) that do not limit their trade and use of bitumen, namely green and yellow.
There are seven countries (or more than 3 per cent) with limited market (white) and 10 countries (or 4 per cent) have been defined as illegal (red) currency, 130 countries (or 53 per cent) have no more to deal with digital currency information (green).
This statement indicates that countries that constitute a global body (53 per cent and more than half) are still looking forward to the legitimacy of the monetary currency that is the leading currency, and also represents the old-fashioned "black-day risk" of Bitten, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions restricting the monetary currency.
The article considers that the global regulatory body has yet to fully understand this new category of digital currency, possibly because most countries have not yet done so.
Although the "human air" in Bitten currency has increased significantly since last year, it is not of interest to all countries, some countries may be concerned about the threat caused by local legislation or are more concerned about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
The Wall Street news has been detailed in detail in the past week's international regulatory press on Bitmond, including China's launch of online services to combat foreign trade in the field, and the Koreans are still considering closing digital currency transactions, and the EU believes that Bitmond has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of "responsibility to blood".
Wall Street's presidential election "Read more about 2018: Global Mother's opening of the Bill of Money?" She mentioned that, from the regulation, acceptance/crisis and adoption of a single perspective, it would become a global currency year in 2018.
The practice of estimating the legal status of the currencies of Russia, such as Russia, was also intended to provide the official with a digital currency route.
On 8 January, the New York Society of Madrid (representatively known as the wise) New South American Cutinoo on the 8th day of New South America in New York City, was wearing the first bassa ball dress in Nocanup.
It adopted a physical examination of Basa on the morning of the day and signed a contract with the President of Basa Batomeu in 2023.
And then he was a baseball player, and there were about 7,000 volleyballs in Nocanpe.
According to the Spanish media, the total contribution of Cutinoo or up to EUR 1.6 billion (1 Euros totalling 7.77 people) is the first prize in the Basa Club and Western History.
Because Kutino was still injured, he had to spend nearly 20 days on his own bicycle.
What other sacred things?
The White House of Tranquip is now in favour of free women's gods.
The most determined sign of the regime was when they started attacking the image.
The United States and anyone agree to this. So, Saddam, in 2003 in the park of Baghdad, has been subjected to deliberate planning.
Stephen Miller, one of the key wisdoms of the government of Trannon, was in a heated debate on the president's proposal for strict restrictions on legal migrants, and he was sure what would happen to him with the symbolism of the image of free women.
Honestly, Miller didn't attack as he did.
If he did so, such a group of shipowners and liberalism would have led him to live a life of luxury.
But he actually attacked the meaning of the picture, especially in 1903 when the famous song of Lazarus was played on the foundation (this memorial was built 17 years later).
As Miller said to Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but it's a symbol of the free world of America....
And that's what you're talking about, and it's not part of the original-free goddess.
Actually, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it's not true about history.
This relates to the modern response to the voice of Lazarus ’ death, the only country seems to invite not only any elderly migrants but also the poorest of the poor: "Your poverty, your poverty, or the people of your working group wish to breathe freely, and/or the people of suffering reject the sea you own."
There's no "depressed man" in our screen that becomes more exciting.
Miller did not perform his written comments, and he clearly indicated that these people would not be welcomed by the United States of America in the general period.
This conflict on the meaning of pornography is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict with the spirit of the United States.
Lazarus (Lazarus) and her, after her death, was actively engaged in the activities of her friends on the ground, who knew that their participation was highly political.
The purpose of this poem is to express the link between France and the United States of America, by comparing the old tradition with the feminineity of the free goddess.
Lazarus changed his mind: In her womb, the woman's image is no longer attractive and she wants to hear.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of the flow.
It was a successful change in female sovereignty and a destructive fight against American patriotism.
Just as Lazarus changed the image, the right one has always wanted to change it in the original sense.
Rush Limbaugh (Rush Limbaugh) is a popular temporary cleanser who in 2010, he felt that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and he is now an early preserver, bringing the U.S. smart fire to the foolish world: "Free woman is bravely ahead of time.
She's actually going to bring the fire of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fire is not the way of the United States. "
It's not unusual that Lynbo was actually driven by something.
The meaning of the image depends entirely on the point of recognition.
The most powerful method is to see it. When poor, poor and desperate people are able to see it on board the ship.
From the perspective, this involves those who seek asylum and have an opportunity to improve the outlook of people living in the world.
She seems to have told them and needs the hope and the goodwill they hear.
Of course, this is not the view that Miller and Tranquip ever wanted to admit.
Their fires are not for the path of light, but for the hatred of their only source of power.
In 2006, Sasa was the first Chinese to sign a unique musical reggae album with the world's headquarters.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black.
Elid Doyle, remember that there were only two Swedish people in the British state.
Niel Black, Executive Director of the British Association of Tail, said that a team composed of 16 strong Swedish people in the World Cup would make a great contribution to "the country team".
The number of Swedish athletes selected to participate in the 2017 London World Cup, which was opened on Friday, 2017.
Blake believes that "Supergian is achieving extraordinary development," the British Thai movement must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will keep going until we succeed," Black said.
"I'm looking for people at the Sugland Sports School who think it's related to them.
The Swedish Thai movement considers this to be relevant to them.
The British Thames Association considers this to be relevant to them.
That's what even street people think.
Whatever the case, it's very embarrassing."
Many of the Siojana-Tao's champions, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, will be the leader of the team in 5,000 meters with Mo Farah, and Eliid Doyle.
"Eried's a little stupid.
Her boss's speech is very hard to believe," Blake said.
"Many athletes, regardless of whether they live or work wherever they live, go from door to door with pride, go from door to door, and go from door to door.
Elrid's natural intrusion and really good. "
He will take part in his fifth World Cup, 400-Michael, the head of the United Kingdom Bank, and he will say that there are 16 Swedish people in the British National Team, which is "unthinkable."
In the past, the number of participants in the World Cup was seven, namely the number of racers achieved in 1983 and 2015.
In the past year, she was created by five British records and two European records.
She's going to take part in 1500 meters and 5,000 meters project games.
She had achieved a good success before she had won a successful match in the British countries for the pre-election and the Oussoon season.
Doyle recalled that she was in the first World Cup, and that was when the only other Swedish in the group was Lee McConnell.
The chief said that she was deeply proud that so many of her colleagues were not only members of the team, but in some cases they would also challenge the prizes and enter the contest.
"The special part of the country team is that it is elected by the other team members of the country, so knowing that your team vote is going to make you a very unusual success, however, it is a great privilege for me," she adds.
"Of course, I feel very proud of all the members of the Sugland.
It's just showing how far we've gone.
And they're all the old-fashioned champions here, who's about to enter the goal of the Korean Presidency.
How'd my boss say that?
Well, I think it's great.
I just pointed to this fact, that in this case, we are very lucky, because we are at the headquarters of the World Cup.
Therefore, it is very important for us to support the capital, as well as to be able to grow as a result of returning to the Olympics.
I'll get a second chance to participate in the game, and the surroundings there will be unspoken."
A total of 18 million employees were employed in 2016, with a total of up to 1218 million employees, with 21 per cent growth.
Critics on the facebook: If you can't bear the responsibility of the voters, don't vote in public.
Our father knows how bad the media are.
The Americans loved Washington, but soon the newspapers began to attack him violently, from domestic policies to political principles.
He's mad at these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't shout these critics.
As early as 1783, Washington said, "The freedom of expression is taken away--we will be killed like a sheep in silence and stupidity."
This makes me think of Larry Hogan, governor of the state of Milan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have broken down and removed at least 450 hostages, as they expressed their views on his face-to-face official page.
This was the case with him earlier this week, the United States Civil Liberties Union.
The officials of the Government felt that the procedure was too slow, and the online news filled their strong opposition: "Who cares?"
Many say, "It's just a book."
But it's important.
That's especially important, because it's people like Hogan.
This was a common party who served as governor in most states in a democratic state, and he was also warmly welcomed.
In 50 Heads of State, he received a good score number two.
Hogan's not an active emergency worker.
He's a stable man in the state of Milan. He's strictly adhered to rules.
He is also very good at using the facebook as the main way to communicate with the electoral community, and playing with the head of the post-chemistry on the main page.
Therefore, it is not necessary for those who come to the Prime Minister's comments to be completely unnecessary, and ultimately very dangerous. This is a public forum, an official management platform for staff who are being paid tax by the public.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hong Kong's speaker Amelia Sass said that she felt that she was trying to make them a bit more strict.
However, they described it as a flood storm or a global flood storm, which is on the net.
"Washington's Post" has spoken to the people who have been attacked by Hogan.
They are only the common people in the leadership dialogue that they choose: they are teachers, businessmen and pastors, and they are not anything but a flood of water.
They insist that their comments are profound, respectful, and unambiguous.
The priest quoted "the Bible" in his poem and called for the memory of his divine faith.
Rakhimi Salma Ramani, a leading lawyer in the state of Milan, asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the press commentary on the Washington Post, "I kindly commented that I was disappointed that he was not responding to hate crimes and other recent news events.
I also don't like to comment on the same subject because they will be directly ignored by some people, thinking that they are of the public mind, rather than becoming a citizen of a proud nation. "
The so-called "compressed trash information bomb" appears to be "suppressive".
In the face-to-face era, it is easy to change information and only a critic or a negative comment needs to be deleted.
It also clears away from the past and requires the same effect in the past century to send out staff members out of search and destruction with criticisms or arrests or complaints against protesters.
But that's really what's going on now, but it's on the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shouting at others on facebooks and other social media.
President Tranp was accused of being a Twitter user because he had beaten them on Twitter.
A formal decision was issued last week in the state of Virginia on such issues.
According to regional judge James C. Karáris of the United States of America, the President of the Board of Supervisors has violated the first amendment from her face-to-face page.
Matt Bewin (R) is also supervised by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union for its use of facebooks and tweets.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, there were similar impacts on the cost of mail and the Internet.
The number of newspapers was reversed between 1776 and 1800, and his leadership was severely criticized by anonymous writers.
And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous flood storm.
People used Yurikra, Valerius, Belisera, and Pudals to describe the decisions of Washington, D.C.
According to a historical document gathered on the website of George Washington, his office was rejected by the petitioner and was critical of his attitude towards the "British King and Friends of the United States of America" signed with the United States of America.
But he didn't scream at them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of expression are the foundation of the country.
And the real leaders need to accept this.
It's all about the city's freshness that makes people feel more sensitive.
The procurement is one of the hard-to-reading policies in many urban premises.
In May 2017, the Guinean Forum provided for a policy of buying-in for the same domestic residents as the local resident for the same year as for the continued grant of the grant of the present generation.
In June, the U.S.A. policy provided for the completion of a university degree certificate and employment certificate within three years.
Next, the policy code is officially stated, "the students can buy less than 20 per cent of the market price";
In July, it was provided that the university of field sciences and young people who had studied above could be enrolled in a certificate of formal qualifications.
In addition, there were mountains and cities or regions such as the Port of the Sea, where there was a "people's entry" policy, which would reduce the rent for people.
It is believed that this is, in fact, the most important of all cities for the sake of the people, especially the people, and for the people in particular, and for the cities to be competitive, which is the most important thing for these housing policies.
Some even think that this means that the time has come to cancel the "requirement" of the building.
On the day of the film's leadership, the film was long gone, and the first redesign was in 1999 and even ready to search for the capital to play the 13th.

It's amazing to come to this place.

It's really a special memory, we'll always remember."
He was 50 years old when he came back to the Tubbish game, and he was also involved in a regular European tour of Europe.
This is the first time he has been in the Swedish golf course since 2013.
Or, Helensburger, says: "It will be more meaningful to go home in the rurals.
You want to do well, but you can feel the extra pressure.
I'm really happy to be able to play again. I've been fighting golf.
I am very content with the present situation."
In addition, three groups of former winners, Ian Voussan and Paul Brodchest, Roger Chapman, Mark James and McNewty, were joined.

In Beijing on 22 August, the Director-General for Environmental Oversight of the Ministry of Environment of China introduced 57 cases of continuing punishment in the country, and the revised Environmental Protection Act, which had been implemented earlier this year, marked by the Chinese environmental enforcement force.
At present, environmental security agencies in China can be used to monitor environmental violations by day-to-day penalties, to investigate detentions, to limit assets and to transfer administrative detentions, and to punish environmental crime with judicial bodies.

Of these, 7 continue to be punished by the river, and China is currently in the process of integrating, from final control to complete, comprehensively, environmental pollution management.
While the pressure from the economy is apparent, the Chinese Department of Environment has already made it clear that it should address the position of environmental protection in economic development, to strengthen the "green strength" of the economy as it progresses rapidly and as it is unable to relax and play a positive role in environmental protection for the economy.

Poverty and death in Indonesia
Badena Daye's cooking doesn't have a cake.
She's even less used.
Her house is located in Enerrotali, the capital of Panyy, Papua, Indonesia, where the family's owner is usually just putting a red cloth — the locals call it "nota" — directly into the fire.
In half an hour, the red rose was taken out of a unwashed hands and eaten by the smoldering beaks.
Dage sat on the floor -- she had no furniture, and here she was doing everyday household chores, such as washing clothes, washing clothes, and washing clothes, all came from the nearby toilets.
A room with no roofs, it's a bathroom.
She's the youngest of four wives, so she's not assigned to the field to care for.
There's a lot of a couple around here.
Of course, working late will be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and many are as filthy as dust, and there are many soldiers here.
She said, "No one can walk in the village at 5:00 a.m.."
This is a common sight in the Baba Highlands, where it was a colony in the Netherlands, where in 1969 the population of Indonesia was elected after the referendum, but the vote was due to be disputed, and only 1026 of the officials were forced to vote in front of the army in front of the occupied area.
The campaign against the Dutch government is currently demanding independence and will soon turn its head again to the Government of Jakarta, as the Government exercises high-pressure control over the region, separating foreign journalists and defenders.

Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Baba wrote to a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here too.
And she said, "We don't wear these clothes.
"We used to cover our bodies with trees."
Baba is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28 per cent of people live below the poverty line, as well as in Asia's highest and low literacy rates.
But this is also Indonesia's gold.
There are some 153,000 people in the Panyee area, with 153,000 people in the same area as New Jersey. The world's largest, the most profitable gold miners in the world, is 60 miles away, all of which are located at the headquarters of the Filippe McMorlan gold company.
In 2015 alone, Philippe opened some $31 billion worth of gold and diamonds here.
In addition, Baba ' s timber resources were very rich and estimated at $780 billion.
However, these rich resources are also a terrible source of Palestinians, and the powerful military forces of Indonesia have been able to keep them under constant pressure.
A 2005 survey report in New York revealed that between 1998 and 2004, Philippe paid nearly $2 million to local military personnel and troops, a single official of up to $150,000.
The independence of the peoples of the Papuan people is becoming more and more powerful against the claim of independence, which threatens the rich, who have been subjected to cruel treatment.
According to the defenders, there have been more than 50 million Palestinians killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass murder in the country of Babaja in the 1970s has increased as a result of genocide.
In the last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report of Prime Minister Brisban of the Heavenly Brispan, "We will lose everything" covering evidence of the abuse of the previous year, for example, the execution of extrajudicial killings, another report called rape and e-mails, in particular, the violence against the demonstration of peace movements.
“ Violence is happening every day, so it is difficult to calculate the number of victims,” says the Indian researcher Andreyas Harrison of the Human Rights Watch.
Baba's resources have attracted a large number of immigrants outside of Indonesia and pressure has begun.
Of the 350,000 population in the province, 83 per cent were Christians, but the Moslem economy migration from the deep-rooted island of Ouwa, Garimandan, and the island of São Tomé and Príncipe was changing after coming here.
The small ones of the Vulcans are sold to the popcorn and vegetables mix and are used to produce fruit.
The locals are trying to fight.
The 24-year-old Pannies Yu moved to the province of Chiapara to find work, and he explained that "the migrants started selling meat and vegetables at the traditional markets at a lower price than the locals.
This has caused the local Baba - the Baba women (ma-ma) - to lose their market."
President Zoko Vidododo (sometimes known as Zokovi) vowed to address the problem of inequality and abuse of authority in Baba in 2014 in his campaign activities.
This old wooden road to President Jagada was supported by 27 regions throughout 29 regions — including Panyai.
But Baba didn't change anything, and today the locals feel betrayed.
In particular, "We've broken our hearts, we voted in 2014 to Kosovo, hoping that he will achieve our will and regain justice."
In fact, only two months after the 10th of Zukowi, Panyai experienced the worst nightmares.
On December 7, 2014, 11 of Enerrotali’s children sang Christmas songs before the fire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly flew on the motorcycle.
Surprised kids told them they should open the car lights.
According to local priest Ajit Thaba, one of the soldiers said that they were upset and then brought back four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said these drunk soldiers were chasing these kids with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot these kids.
16-year-old Julianus Chimham was severely beaten.
A few hours later, the government's election committee burned the building of the bridge, and the second day's incident improved.
About 1,000 young Babua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police and military command centre.
Mee Pago's meita dance -- round and behind.
Some protesters started to throw stones at the military frequently.
According to an official document seen in the journal "A Time magazine, where the situation continued to escalate, soldiers received orders through the internal radio: "If the population is more than three times opposed, shoot immediately." But the document did not release it to the local media.
56-year-old Jeremias Kaamu was head of the Kego Koto district of Enerrotali, where he felt that there would be a danger, so he called the people calm and asked them to come home.
But no one's willing to listen to him.
He stood at the door of his blue-colored wooden house and said, "When I came back to my head, my left leg suddenly shot."
Kayama still doesn't know who's fired, but he said the bullet came from a bunch of soldiers.
He said, "That was a tough time. They had a lot of guns."
According to the local brother of Olvius Yure, he saw a gun and saw three of the Olvius Yures shots.
Johannez was sad to say, "The Age magazine," and I ran to check on his body.
I found him dead and I kissed him."
Governor Yuje Mend told the reporter that his remains were only in the Police Protection Agency, as the police had been attacked.
In 2015, police speaker Pugio Sullistio, the chief of police, called "the threat of killing us, we must defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
The next day, the news of this murder was spread in Jakarta only slowly.
Three weeks later, Zukovi made a statement in Chiapula, expressing deep compassion for the victims' families and committed to resolving the abuse of the rights remaining in Baba ' s history.
He said, "I wish that this case could be solved as soon as possible, so that the future would never happen again."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security Willan claimed that he was going to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the issue of the historical remnant of human rights violations.
But the excuse is almost silent.
He said, "Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we have committed ourselves to solving these violations, but it also requires a process. "
Then, on June 5th, in Jakarta, Vilando, in dialogue with the "Times" magazine, he said he did not plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Baba.
On the contrary, he said, "Everything will be resolved by law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Vilando on the “against Human Rights Crime” in the 1999 independent vote on East Timor ' s bloodbath, but he said that the 11 cases of human rights violations, including the Pani incident, have been resolved in the province of Baba.
The family of the victims of the Pani-Ai incident was ashamed of these words.
“In the past three years, I have accepted four interviews, but the situation has not been fully progressed.”
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Jokabus also felt that the people of Panai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was attacked by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After the body is buried, the army comes to me."
The gun didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in Panya's neighborhood.
A construction company manager refused to help transport a missing man to the hospital, a conflict occurred, a death, and 17 injured, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Raviananus Dowwell, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's existing office.
The police called the villagers to throw stones at the police, so the police fired a warning.
But the Anti-Fraud Forces (Indigentian Military Police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
29-year-old Domingo Baddy told the magazine "The Age," "We were all tired, and now we're afraid they're going to recover. "He lived near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
"I've been hiding in the house for two days."
The DIA parliament has called for the prosecution of police and for the withdrawal of the anti-corruption forces from the area.
Panie has always been a place for the Government of Indonesia.
Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal peoples have been deprived of effective development, and these tribes are scattered in the central heights of the Pani River.
A number of people joined the Free Barbarian Movement (OPM), which was a rebel army, claiming to protect the rights of the Indonesians by disseminating attacks and attacks.
Some of the top-level leaders of the free Barbarian movement were born in Panyai, including Tadyaus Yuji and Daniel Yudas Chowa.
Thus, for almost a few thousand years, the Panayians had been captured by the military by the battalion of the “Keeping National Sovereignty” and were willing to be detained.
Some people haven't seen it yet.
In the eyes of the Baba people, Panya is a "forgets of tragedy."
Poverty is not enough.
Enerrotali's selling a little poor, and the locals can't afford it.
It's not gonna be far away.
The people who plant all that they can eat are mainly red and some fruits and vegetables.
The seed is the work of women, each woman can care for four or five red areas.
They usually collect most of the left-overs and sell the remaining ones to the local market.
The 10-pound roses are worth only 1 000 indone-lubs (75 in quality).
As time passes, economic inequality has emerged from local Baba and new migrants, and the number of migrants has increased significantly since the opening of the new route to the airport in Birere.
The number of jobs available has often fallen into the hands of more educated and wealthy migrants.
The Baba people have very little funds or the skills needed to operate competitively.
John Goba, President of the Pannies Council, says "Young people don't want to stay in this village because there's no work here."
Baba and the rest.
In addition, the restrictions on international media reports remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basil Loan were expelled from Papua, because they "not cooperate with the relevant institutions", even though they have been given permission to take photos.
According to the Deputy Director-General of the Human Rights Watch of Asia, Férim Cainn, Zukowi withdrew the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development in elections.
In one statement, he stated: "If foreign journalists are trying to report the incomplete provinces of Papua and Zimbabwe in the easternmost part of Indonesia, they are at a new risk: refusal of signatures and listing blacklists. "
No media surveillance means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is essentially limited to neighbouring countries.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate " universal human rights violations in Papua New Guinea", including the Pani-Ai shooting case.
These countries have also supported the Free Barbarian Movement.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Almanat Nasser, expressed concern about the group ' s allegations and told the journalist of Jagada that " Indonesia was still implementing the democratic system and that the freedom of the media was therefore difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations. "
The local people want more attention from foreign Governments.
According to one scholar, on 4 May, when the delegation of the human rights ambassador of the Netherlands visited Chiapura, the local people broke down their silence and asked "We want freedom." He also attended the meeting, but asked for a name.
Indonesia will hold the next presidential election in 2019, but the Baba people claim that they are unlikely to vote again in Kosovo.
The President of the National Council, Goba, said, "The intention of Zokovi is good, but he is all around the people who took part in the Pannies shooting."
He wanted Zokovi to know that the Panai people were not only in danger of living under the threat of the armed forces, but not all of them, the education of the region, and the lack of public health services.
Goba said that the people of Panyai, like other Babaans, felt that their election to Zokovi was a duty he had to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and threats, the families of the victims of the Pani-Aid shooting continued to act as their last symbol: to hide a victim's body in the face of the military police raid.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those criminals forget their crimes.
Jokabus, under the head, said, "My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
Sofia, a guest, with a solid card on the basis of capitalization, is establishing a large-scale building for the housing industry. On 10 February 2017, the Chinese news agency approved the application for a limited company of the shareholdings of the property in the West Bank, which issued a long-term certificate of entry into the central market, which was just adopted by the European House of Commons for more than 20 days.
In the view of the domestic workers, with the housing of goods, European households are already moving towards the capital of the capital line in the area where they are located on the river.
A new year-on-year subscription was issued to the head of the settlement and a typical representative of the dwelling area, which included information about the arrival of the village and drawing attention to the entire housing industry.
At 9 hours Beijing, three-star electronics company, on Tuesday, issued a group of leading vehicles developed with the Harmon International, as well as information entertainment solutions, which was an important initiative for the company's entry into the military by electronic markets.
The three-star electronics purchased Haman International about a year ago.
At the consumer electronic product exhibition (CES) held this week in Las Vegas, three stars were issued with a hit warning, a driver's warning, a visual camera on the navigation control function, which was developed in cooperation with Hamman.
The three-star plan began to produce this year the camera system, which was built on techniques such as machine automatic learning and expansion.
Three stars also show "digital circuits", even though drivers are not drivers, they can also be more personalized by the vehicle, which allows users to download information from moving equipment and under the roof.
Tonight, the 20th round of CBA's regular competition is about to begin, and this also means that the CBA's half-time of the 2016–2017 season begins.
The big fire didn't burn again.
On Friday, a world-highest housing building in Dubai was set up to force hundreds of residents to flee from this high-level building of 337 metres, 79 metres.
It's a fire in the second floor of the high-level building in a short two-year period, and it's actually happening at the Moseta, called the "Fire".
The building has been disbanded and no reports of injury have been reported and no reasons for the fire have yet to be found.
"We're asleep, and then we're awakened, and people start crying.
We're running down the stairs, running from 50 to about 10 minutes, "a resident named George told the street company.
The civilian defence authorities of Dubai said that the fire forces destroyed at approximately 4 o'clock in the local time (Grenwig's standard time 0000) and were being subjected to a reduction in temperature for the building.
The Government expressed its efforts to provide shelter for affected persons.
This incident may bring back concerns from all over the world about the use of outer material security in high-level buildings.
A study carried out after the fires that occurred in 2015 revealed that most of the damaged objects were covered and unscathed outer walls.
The British police have already indicated that they believe that the temperature and surface system of London's building could be the cause of rapid fires in the 6 month period, resulting in the deaths of about 80 people.
William's car also suggests that Masa might be back, even though he's already declared retirement.
On 9 January, the opening of the Gulf of Korea will be only one month, and the flow of fresh and ready-to-north winds in the Korea country will continue to increase.
The Korean Presidency is looking forward to this long-term Korean conversation that will bring a "floating egg" for a month in the fall of the Ouija board.
On 1 November last year, the Holy See arrived in the Republic of Korea.
The heat from St. John's fire directly reflects the sale of the gates of the Pitton.
Just over two months ago, the sale rate of the OCT was only 32 per cent, and the sales of the OPP was more than 4.3 per cent, and the sales rate of the low-favoured OPF was one of the most worrying concerns of the outsiders.
However, as President of the Committee on the Environment of the Environment, Leavin, recently predicted to the press, "the temperature of the OCT in Korea is increasing, and it is believed that the sales of the gate will soon be a good turn."
According to the Korean media, as at 3 January, the sale of the OCT had reached 64 per cent and the sales of the OCTs had also decreased by 50 per cent.
In order to encourage the recruitment of foreigners, the Ministry of Legal Affairs of Korea also announced that it would extend the duration of the stay in Korea for 120 days.
Investigations found that more than one in five U.S. passengers were carrying contraventions of goods.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had intentionally or indirectly carrying illegal goods through the United States Transport Safety Authority inspection stations, with at least 6 per cent of which were deliberately carrying contraventions of firearms or other goods.
Not enough 1 per cent of passengers claim that they have found the wrong gun, ammunition or explosives to travel.
This investigation was conducted against more than 1,000 persons by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. and found that young passengers could be more clearly ignored.
It was recognized that 19.7% of the respondents who tried to carry TSA's files in violation of the list of prohibited goods had been killed for thousands of generations and that the X generation was less than 15%.
The most common intention is to pass on TSA's products to the inspectors is food and drink.
More than 3 per cent of the people admitted that they had attempted to carry drugs, while 2.2 per cent of the women’s respondents and 3.7% of the men’s respondents also indicated that they had attempted to carry drug registrations.
The company claims that this time the number of national passengers is to find out about the number of persons who are carrying and willing to carry goods over the aircraft in search of security.
It is not surprising that the most likely person who has carried the goods was the most likely to carry them — either intentionally or indirectly — who were the most frequent.
However, the company noted that the TSA guidelines were somewhat complex.
People usually don't know what kind and how many fluids they can carry.
And that's why the TSA's best payment is not surprising.
People once thought that TSA might also be a condom.
The domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed.
The President of the United States Environment Agency, Prutt, changed his mind on the slowdown regulations of the Obama era
A day after the 15 State prosecution, the Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Prut, changed his decision to postpone early implementation of the provisions on the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution in the time of Obama.
This change was proposed by Prut, as the Environmental Protection Agency could respond faster to the needs of the environmental regulatory state institutions than before.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal to his former position.
The focus of the dispute was to set a deadline for the country's beginning to meet the Earth-wide ozone standards in 2015.
In June, Prut announced that he would be delayed one year in order to allow the Environmental Protection Agency to study the plan more and avoid "infringing local decision-making or preventing economic growth".
Prior to the appointment of President Donnad Tranpu, Prut was the Attorney-General of the Republic of Ukraine, who had long opposed the strictization of environmental legislation.
Since the arrival of Washington, Prut has been reversing or slowing the rules against the chemical and petroleum industries.
The sudden turn of the third week was an latest legal obstacle to the rule of procedure on the return agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal decided to extend the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to try to postpone the implementation of the provisions of the Government of Obama ' s request for oil and natural gas companies to monitor and reduce depletion.
In a statement issued on three weeks, Prut proposed a major shift in his attitude towards ozone standards and indicated the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen its commitment to work with States to achieve a new standard.
Prut stated that " under previous government management, the Environment Agency usually did not reach the deadlines specified, and then, at the same time, the groups and other persons filed a complaint and agreed to set a timetable by agreement. " He initiated several times in his previous work to the Environmental Protection Board.
"We do not believe in the rules of procedure, and we are serious about the deadlines.
We also take seriously the rules and the authorities. "
However, the statement made by the Environment Agency indicated that he might again use his "extension mandate and all other legitimate mandates" to ensure that the provisions are consistent with "good policies and best information available".
Community parties in the National Assembly are promoting a wide range of changes in ozone-depleting regulations.
The Parliamentary Act, which was approved last month, aims at deferring the 2015 rules to be implemented for at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The Prosecutor of New York, Eric Schundman, led the Union of States against the United States Environment Agency this week, stating its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schindenman said: "The reverse of the United States Environment Agency - after we have initiated the proceedings - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 670 million New Yorkers and has a direct impact on the release of more than $115 million of American communities. "
Carnivorian State, Cornjug State, Tarawa State, Ilynoi, Ehova State, China, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Olygan State, Rhode Island, Fumont and Washington, and Colombia, participate in the process of joining New York.
Earth-based ozone is a vehicle, a power plant, a oil plant, a chemical plant and other sources of emissions resulting from the reactions of conventional pollutants in the atmosphere.
The smoke caused by this would cause severe respiratory problems to the sensitive population, causing thousands of deaths every year.
Of course, public health promoters and environmentalists are calling for a surprising turn of events.
Lory Anbede, of the Biodiversity Centre, said: "It is disturbing that this awareness-raising measure has been a major pressure on the authorities of the sector to protect the air we breathe."
" We must fight to the full with the Government of Tranquil to bring together the thinking movement of the contemporaneous and special interest groups. "

Since the second half of 2009, the sales in the mountain range (up to 48 per cent) have continued to be higher, especially this spring, and the sale in the mountain range has created a new historical growth, high sales volume, price increases, and, according to statistics, the income in the mountain ranges has been reached by 48 per cent over the previous year and the growth rate has been up to 20 years.
The Under-Secretary-General for Forestry of the Mountain Forests said that with good sales conditions, the production of mountain trees has also resulted in faster development.
For almost two years, the forest range has expanded to 30,000 trees, totaling 18,000 trees; while active development in the area, mountain farms have grown to 80,000 trees throughout the country and increased to 30,000 trees in 2008.
While the plant is expanding, the quality of the tree continues to increase, the value of the tree remains increasing, the size and quality of the tree remains greater, and the sales of some trees occur.
It also reminded the producers that, in the face of the prevailing wave of prosperity, they should be flexible and objectively analysed, as long as the needs of society for trees are long-term and increasing, and that market competition will increase.
On 13 July early Beijing, the U.S. Somaltus submitted proceedings to the District Court of East Texas, accusing the opium of violating a technology patent that it had applied for in 2010.
The company has also used the same expertise to prosecute Wharf, U.S.A., three stars, Sonny and the East.
The case claimed that iPhone 6s and similar plant equipment violated the United States apartheid No. 7,657,386, which is called the "Competition battery service system".

From the trial, the complainant appears to have found that iPhone's fast functioning violated the company's patent.
The iPhone has a fast-functioning power supply will speed up to 80 per cent, and then the power supply will be recharged.

On 27 January, in a call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Huto, Tranp urged him to stop publicly expressing that it would not pay for the construction of the border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States was not satisfied with his public assault on the wall, which was alleged to have said to him, " Don't tell the media."
In the presidential campaign, Tranp pledged to build a separate wall at the southern border of the United States and reiterated its commitment to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
He was also published in a communication record between the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Trenbul, showing the tension between them.
Trenble told Trenbar that the United States ' s commitment to sending refugees to Australia was "dangerous", "dangerous" and "foolish", he recommended that the United States prohibit the re-establishment of refugees, and that now it would make it appear to be a fool.

Mortgage: Activists are again being subjected to the private punishment of racism and the promotion of justice
A 1948 Fort Watercraft car ran through a group of viewers in the small town of Manro, Georgia.
There were four black passengers and a white driver on the car, and a group of white men headed ahead of the car before arriving at the bridge.
It's the head of a terrorist - a middle-aged man wearing a piece of paper - who breathes a bit of snow, and his eyes go into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were terrified.
"We want-- Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was pulled from the front passenger seat and cried out to silence.
Fortunately, on July 22, this terrible scene was just a replay.
But when Roger's neck was put on the package, almost all the onlookers were really excited.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Morbor Bridge, and now two of the Blacks' wives - Roger and Dossey Malcon, and George and Mary Dossey - were sentenced to the night's imprisonment by three K parties.
No one was charged with murder.
"Although we know who they are, even though we have seen them in the community, they have not been arrested in recent years, which is hard to believe," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize this rehearsal.
"It's a point of history, it's our soul's burden."
Brooks, 71, is a former Member of Parliament and a life-saving activist in Georgia.
For him, replay was an attractive call, and reminded the people of the Manro community every year that injustice had never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we're going to end, we're going to heal, we want to reconcile, but we have to get justice first," he said.
" Unless we get justice, we have no cure and no reconciliation. "
On 27 July 1946, the Bureau of the Exploration took over a list of bodies of the victims of a Morbian private punishment.
According to the United States National Broadcasting Corporation's archives of the Federal Investigation Board, more than 50 men from Monroo and surrounding villages were suspected of taking part in private punishment.
But none of them have been charged.
Although it has been suspected that for decades there has been a state of disparity, civil rights activists have shown that the double motive for the implementation of the private punishment throughout the city is well known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision enabled black citizens in the state of Georgia to vote first in the election later that summer.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at about the same time, blacks attacked Agroje Malcom in a fight to kill White Lord Bannet Hester, which seemed to be for a woman.
Brooks said that the town's message was that Hest had slept with Malcolm's wife, and her baby wasn't her husband.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on 25 July 1946, a prominent white man, Mr. Roy Harrison, spent $600 on Malkom's release from prison.
Doris and her sister, Mary and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
But when they came back from prison and almost to Morbulburg, a group of private criminals surrounded the car.
"The fact is that Harrison was organized and ordered to execute this murder," a FBI report concluded.
" Clearly, there was fraud between the state and local law enforcement departments, they not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence but also hid the identity of the witnesses. "
Brooks is very simple.
He said, "This is a voter case."
"They have been murdered by the killer to the black people of the community: "If you register and vote, you will also be faced with the same fate."
For the past ten years, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual re-examination of the Moorb prison case.
She's a well-known character, a heart attack, with a deep roots of racism, and many people hope that such racism will not exist again in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder, but Green says it's the key.
"We don't want to talk about private punishment, because private punishment makes us face the shame of all," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me or hear me tell you my experience, I can't build a relationship with you."
The show started in June, and on the first day of the year, there were close to 30 players -- ten whites, the rest of them blacks -- in one house, listening to Green's performance broadcasts.
Wed Malbo served as co-chair of Green.
For years, he's been playing the role of three K parties, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel so stupid, because I'm not such a person," Malbo said.
"But I think it's very important that we stay alive in this period, because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, the actors of Roger Malcom and Bannet Heste, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were working on their drawings.
At the beginning of this game, Malcolm cried out and moved on to Heste, and he was so angry at his wife that he fell asleep.
"I said, get out of my desk!"
Rascona's back on the way.
Then they got up.
Then everyone, at least all black players, started to laugh.
Green's the best.
"What's going on?" said Rascona.
He's surprised and confused.
Am I too much?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just think white people don't say 'yes' when they come back."
"Yes," another black actor was playing.
"Your speech must be strong."
In this way, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of friendship has gone unappreciative.
Everyone tried to do this, not only to play this game, but also to remember the four victims.
Start again.
This time, Rascona said this, "Oh, when it's the word, it's strong.
No one's laughing.
The replay is strong and it's over fast.
Crying, shooting, and then, it's a silence.
A girl in a funeral dress standing beside the actor sings the sad words of Billy Hallie "Frequent truth."
Her voice has been heard in other languages.
In addition to a hundred, about 40 observers are constantly squatting the water and the eyes.
Almost half of the blacks and whites in the audience.
There's a team of couples from New York, Isaac, and a lot of people live by the streets.
Brooks took them to the graveyards of Malkom and Douxi, where they spent almost eight hours on the road, and everyone was suffering from the unpleasant heat of Georgia.
Until now, the killers are still a fraud, but now, standing on the same land where private punishments occur, the air's undermining.
When the last song was gone, Green invited people to the bodies of close inspectors.
The kids are down on their heads, looking at fake blood and body, interfering with each other's private language.
"They're not really dead," said a young boy in his own tongue, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the crowd, and then the show ended.
The performer opens the private record and clears the eyes.
Bradson holds a three-K party head for the Westman Malbo.
Nick Rascona welcomed his two colleagues and wept in their tears; the emotion in the performance was eventually affected by him.
"It's okay," said one of the women.
"We know your heart isn't like that.
You're doing this for a reason."
Then the audience sat down and went to dinner with the actor.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta spoke to a black couple they had just met and talked about the rehearsal.
Dennis Duplinsky found it difficult to express her feelings after seeing her.
"It's hard to imagine the terrible words and actions that you're saying and doing, because they look like you," she said.
"It really makes me think that private punishment is still taking place," she added, "and now it's called the police shooting."
In the room, Tyron Brooks sat next to the table, watching the goods and referring to civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the show next year.
"Replay is a way of encouraging the hearts, as it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also educational enough," he said.
"If you don't take lessons from it, this might happen again.
Those who don't study, those who don't know their own history will be forced to reexamine."
The importance of the reform of the "individual" in the field of natural gas market reform is not limited to the importance of the "individual" reform, but is also greater than the tension and controversy.
On 7 days, the journalists were informed of the opening of the river group at 11.25 a.m. and the explosion of 13 workers in the open-ended labor force in the Borough of Downtown, Province of the River.
As of now, 13 people have been detained, one person has been rescued, the hospital has been rushed to rescue, and 12 others are in urgent need of rescue.
It is understood that the site is now closed, local security, fire and medical services are being assisted.
According to the observer, there was a loud noise in the event, and the time was up to the end of the night.

Media: Scientists at the University of China Air Force Engineering Research Satellite to clean space waste
On January 18, the U.S. media reported that China's scientists proposed a huge innovation, using a large-scale solar system to clean up the earth orbits and destroy the old satellites and their space trash.
According to the U.S. Journal of the Journal of the United States on 15 January, researchers at the University of the Engineering of the Chinese Air Force have published a paper entitled "Climate Clearing the Models of Small-sized Space Depletion", which describes how space debris can be made smaller and does not pose such a threat.
It is reported that over the years, space waste has always been an issue of concern to international space institutions, and the United States Space Agency has considered a number of options for monitoring, exploring and eliminating debris.
The way in which large-scale space debris is cleared includes a large network of wastes that can be used to clean and collect waste, as well as the engines that can be used to extract them from orbits. Chinese scientists have conducted a thorough study of the radiation and have concluded that this will be an effective way of cleaning the earth's orbit.
The summary of the document states: " (excellent research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris technologies to the space-based lighting platform. "
A 2014 study of the United States Anti-Semitics Locchid-Martin found that about 200 threats were at risk every day for satellites operating along the road.
The high-speed segment of the Earth orbit movement is considered a serious threat to future space tasks, as described by European Space Agency experts as "a deadly threat".
On January 17th, the U.S. public machinery website reported that the space was basically empty, but that the earth's space was becoming increasingly occupied. We sent every satellite into space would eventually become another part of the earth's operation, and with time transfer, these particles would be collected.
More and more, some of the satellites that are still operating are being hit by a higher rate of broken-off and further damage or destruction of an investment of a million dollars.
It is reported that all space agencies have developed plans to clean space waste in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of radiation emissions and removing their orbits, and Europe is considering launching a large network of satellites to capture debris and to return to the Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture debris with an electric band.
In the light of the fact that China has also proposed a solution to space waste, that is, using a large-scale explosive device to break down the floating space waste into such a little piece of waste.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the University of the Chinese Air Force Engineering in Germany in the "Science" month, such a lighting device on a satellite will be installed sufficiently effectively clean up space, at least on the basis of modelling results.
It is reported that the only way to prove effectiveness is to test the existing arrangements for such a mission, but perhaps early in the evening someone will install the light bulbs on the satellite and then send them to space.
Once it has been done, we can finally start the issue of the permanent elimination of space waste.

In the independent room of the Los Angeles ESPN office, they were able to travel to the front of the Galicia High-level Championships of the World Championships Council, with the consent of the World Championships Association.
At the showtime game held on Saturday, it was agreed that Georgia had won the victory of Adrian Brona World Championship in four districts, and that is why both of them had become the first five players in the battle with the heavy rank.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "The champion, how are you?

"I've been a small level before, "Gassia notes.
"I'm going up to the level to fight Bron's 140 pounds, but my weight isn't that big.
About 140 pounds, my body's about.
I want to get back to the light level.
And he has to reach a low level of 135 pounds, and then we can fight.
That's what the pimps want.
Then we'll meet them."
The Romance Group agreed to this.
"The battlefield needs this fight."
Crimas asked him whether he should pay, and his part of his strategy was to allow Lomajunko to compete with a 135 winner later this year in order to set a date for the next summer with Garcia (37-0.30 rounds).

Latest results of the survey of Swedish refugee age assessment
The latest methods of testing of Swedish refugees were used to assess their age from medically, and the latest results showed that more than 80 per cent of the victims were judged to be over 18 years old, but not all believed in their accuracy.
The test was initiated earlier this year by the Swedish National Medical Centre (R.ttsmedicalverket).
The Swedish Immigrationverket (Migrationsverket) designed these tests to carry out a more accurate age assessment in the process of escape.
To date, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6880 testers, and the Legal Medical Centre has now published a total of 2481 testers for the period mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was sentenced to 18 years or more, but in 25 other cases, the Swedish National Law Medical Centre also determined the subject of "probably 18 years or more".
In 432 samples, the result is "maybe 18 years old".
Only those who have questions about age.
According to John Gleanson of the Legal Medical Centre, these results are consistent with the results of the previous few months.
He told The Local: "The data and the data in the past few months are not very different, and the figures are quite consistent."
Cases of higher than 18 years of age are not necessarily reported by those refugees.
In May, the Centre published 581 sample results and said that 442 "shows this tester is 18 years old or older".
Svenska Dagbladet has investigated the results of 581 cases published this year, in which 243 of these cases have been reported publicly to be 18 years of age.
The X-ray testing of the brain, the joint scan of the connective tissue, and the results of analysis by dentists and radiologists, are also being questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects was a graduate student, Claude Marcus, of the Caroline School, whose work included assessing people's biotechnology to determine whether they were early or late in their normal years of adolescence.
He told the newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I think that the method of measurement used should not be so.
In this way it is not accurate to determine the age of the reproductive age.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can do it."
However, Glanson of the Legal Medical Centre has the right to defend these tests: "A child can generally be found to be at low risk of not determining the risks for adults. "
The greatest risk is that this person is just under 18 years of age, which is about 10 per cent.
The State Minister of Sivriginia announces the party
On Thursday night, Jim Justin (Jim Justice) of the State Democratic Party of Sivriginia announced at the meeting of President Tranop, that he would change the party.
"I like it, I don't like it, the Democratic Party has left me," said the governor.
"Today, after I've done a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I'm going to tell you today that I can't help you with the status of the Democratic Party."
The meeting's out loud.
"So, tomorrow, I will change the party into a common party," Justin added.
"As a teacher, I'm going to tell you when it's time for another game to start."
Trannon made a solemn commitment to make a significant announcement at a meeting in Sivrigina.
Mr. Tranp won 42 per cent of the votes in the state of Sivriginia, and Jastys did not support the democratic party's candidate Hilari, Clinton.
According to the "Fobs" report, Jastys was selected in 2016 as the only millionaire in the state.
"Fobs" notes that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
At present, his cost is about $19 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Common Party issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The replacement party of Governor Jastys is another fight against the Democratic Party, which will not prevent our countries from becoming more large again, but will make our countries even larger. "
"The Democratic Party currently only has 15 Heads of State and controls the number of national parliaments as low as possible, and the statement by Governor Jastys is the most recent rejection of a political party that is active in unity," said Rona, president of the National Committee of the Parties, in a statement published in the CBS press.

Sebastian Kok says Russia's apology for the "intimacy" of the urgency of the drug.
Fourth week, the President of the International Trade Union, Sebastian Ko, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the intoxicating drug, and said that it was very "sound", but he reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to re-enter the movement.
The President of the Russian Federation, Mitrey Hilakdin, in the International Union of Lands before World Trade Labels, stated that his country was banned from participating in the movement and he was determined to combat the incentives.
He said he was so sorry that "all the players who got gold and silver in the game were deprived of the prize."
Despite such comments, the International Conference of the United Nations continues to vote in favour of the maintenance of the ban. Earlier, in the report of the World Anti-Frauding Agency (WADA), the Russian State had found evidence of the promotion of the use of incentives, which was implemented in November 2015.
"I believe that today's response is very clear and very clear," the President of the International Trade Union told the journalist.
"The Council and the General Assembly are pleased... that the Russian Federation has recognized itself as a very busy time, and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia is able to resume its participation in the game."
He said he's also "happy" Russia has accepted the standards of re-transition.
"I think this is a very constructive day, and I think we have made some progress, but the General Assembly supports the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Group, and is not yet in the process of restoring Russian citizenship," he said.
"We need to normalize the situation within the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been the desire to separate the pure motifs from the contaminated system," he adds.
Nineteen Russian Movements will participate in the World Trade Marks held in Vulland on Sunday in line with the strict standards of the International Trade Union.
The head of the International Trade Union Task Force, Mr. Ann Anderson, said that Russia had not yet met a number of criteria for the return of the race.
He told the journalists that the drug testing continued to be insufficient and that the trainees who were banned were still in school after a speech was delivered to the International Council of Trade Unions in London.
The Beijing Tobacco Control Regulation, which was launched this morning, will be implemented for a year's round of advertising activities, and the "My Smoking Declaration" will be interactive for young students in the national youth control video prizes with the Ambassador of the National Smoking Controls, and will recall the collection of videos and awards.
Newspapers were informed of the activity that young players were recruited as national envoys of tobacco advertising.

The publication of the United States Book of Economics shows that almost 12 areas of the Union have reported an appropriate increase in economic activity in early 2018 and maintain a positive outlook for this year's future.
At the same time, the unemployment rate in December of the United States remained at 4.1 per cent, at least for the year 2000, and it is expected that businesses will earn more than a few months in the future.
The U.S. officials generally believe that tax change is a factor in supporting this balanced economic outlook, which the United Nations forecast would increase by 2.5 per cent in 2018 and increase by 3 per cent.

How does the financial rules of the football field affect Neymar?
The rules aimed at preventing the unlimited expenditure of the European Hautman Football Club will not prevent Nemal from being transferred from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the Paris St. German Football Club (PSG).
As a result, the European Football Association (EUFA) has further reduced the number of football clubs in Paris, and the European Football Association has the right to ban the participation of the various teams in the European football club, which is widely concerned.
The "Financial Fair Competition Rules" (FFP) issued by the European FFP in 2011 means that the Paris St.
The Barcelona Club has paid $22.22 billion ($2.62 billion) only to pay the defunct costs of the Brazilian football team, and the net wage will be up to $1 million per year.
The following are some of the financial implications of the Nemal transfer to France.
In view of the funds of the team from the wealthy Qatari family of rulers, the Paris St. German football club can, of course, sign Nemal with cash and include him in the other team of stars.
Clubs can afford large-scale buyers, but they must use legal income sources to complement the large-scale funds to bring them to balance in the relevant operations of football.
"The Financial Rules for Fair Competition" is the idea proposed by Michel Platini (Michel Platini) after the election of President of the European Union in 2007.
This former French footballer believes that if banks or all of them withdraw their financial support, they are actually cheating on the risk of ruining the club in the case of the club for the club's high-ranking club to pursue success.
In 2011, the focus of the "rules" was to monitor the losses of the club from the debt issue of the club.
This change means that Roman Abramovich (Roman Abramovich) was used to purchase a business model in 2003 when the Chelsea Club was acquired, that is, buy a potential club and then significantly improve the team and create a global brand, which is now facing a more severe situation.
In the three-year "rule" evaluation period of 2018, the club may lose $3,000.
Although Abu was defeated by the President at the time of his death in 2015, Alexander Ceferin, the successor of the European Union, Alexander Ceferin, remained committed to preventing excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, of course, has not yet failed, and we are sure to strengthen future regulations, and we will inform the U.S.
Although the Paris St. German football club would pay one of the purchases provisions of netmala, it could also allocate the amount within the contractual period.
Nemal has signed an agreement for five years, so the transfer of contributions in the annual accounts for the next five years may indicate the cost of EUR 4440 million.
The first "rules" imposed in 2014 has resulted in the most severe sanctions against the Paris St. German football club, as well as the Manchester City Club under the Abuzabi flag.
The Paris St. German football club was sentenced to a fine of EUR 6,000,000 (at that time the exchange rate was $88 million), which was later reduced to $2,000, and requested the team to reduce the number of players to 21 during the 2014-15 season, not the normal 25 players.
The European Union is looking at those who are trying to increase their income through the association with the owner of the club and corrupt the club of the financial regulators.
While Qatar ' s company could support the Paris St. German football club, the European Union would not be considered legal income if the amount of the promotion was considered to be above the standard market price.
This is what happened in 2014 and the European Union decided at the same time that the Qatar Tourism Agency had been able to support the expansion of the Paris St.
It was reported that a portion of the income of the German football club in Paris, Nemal, is likely to be paid by the Qatar World Cup Commission in 2022.
However, both the Paris St. German football club and the Committee of the Group deny that Nemal will serve as a World Cup Ambassador, but such initiatives are easy for the European Union regulatory bodies.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris St. German football club meant that the European Union would be more warning of any attempts to break any rules.
The fourth expert said that the European Union had not had prior discussions with the Paris St. James football club on the Nemara transfer.
The above individuals were contacted only with unknown identity, since they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris St. James football club.
The last published account shows that the income of the Paris St. German football club in 2015-16 was €5.424 billion and over €1,000 million.
The accounts of the previous accounting year have not yet been published.
The Federation of the United States Football Club of the United States of America hopes that it will bring the good news for the promotion of activities that allow it to operate and sell ball clothing.
The Club is expected to have a 30 per cent increase in the post-martial income of Nemal.
It is clear that, seeing the greatest of them left, the Spanish Federation was deeply angry and tried to prevent Nemal's movement and claimed that the Paris St. German football club violated "the rules".
The President of the Western Mediterranean Union, Javier Tambas, told Spanish newspaper AS, "This is clear evidence of 'financial incentives' together, that the club and the country are the same", meaning Qatar, with the ultimate ownership of the Paris St. German football club.
Arsene Wenger, president of the Arsene Wenger, all of the people of the club, held a reservation for the attitude of the National Funding Club and the Western Union.
"This is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecosystem of the last 15 years of football " , Wing Thursday.
"When the country owns the club, something will happen.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the rules, because for a country, there are many different ways or different interests to ask for a flag member. "

"The first day of the camp" was a strong protest, but it was not only because of its infamous silence (the drama was the original story of a single conversation on a cook's head, by H.J. Benjamin Bid).
It's not that it's possible to get back to the past and become part of a joke.

British National Health Service (NHS)
In the wake of the establishment of the High Court on the provision of NHS for drug financing, patients will be able to begin to receive HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS announced that pre-explosive drugs (PREP), a drug used before sexual behavior, have been proven to reduce the risk of infection of high-risk groups. The health services agency will now provide it with a three-year initial test to the estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to provide funds for the trial following the Court's last year's support for the Supreme Court's decision, which stated that while NHS claimed that the local authorities should provide funds for such a drug, NHS had the right to pay the costs of PrEP.
The campaign announced on Thursday was announced by Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS (Symon Stevens) in England as "a major new intervention", and the National AIDS Trust Fund (NAT) described it as "a critical time".
London, Brighton, Manchester, Lisbon and Sheffield will become the first registered sexual health clinic. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation in April 2018 in England.
Pre-explosive drug prevention (PREP) is a pre-sexual use to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experience shows that PREP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among the infected population.
Prep used before sexual behavior means that there are sufficient specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This medicine can be used every day or two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual men, transgenders, and those who failed to receive treatment.
The clinic will determine whether the participants, including men, women, transgenders and their HIV-related partners, agree to accept the treatment of antiretrovirals.
Persons who live in England and register as a whole can also participate in the registered sexual health clinics that they participate in.
The plan would cost $1,000, while the NHS subsidiary agency signed a contract for the purchase of these drugs after the international competitive procurement took place this week.
The test aims to assess the full potential of the PREP, based on a large sample, to collect information on how to place it, absorb and implement it.
Mr. Stevens said: "This important new intervention should play a broader and more successful role in the prevention of HIV.
This is another step forward for more than 30 years to address the major health challenges of humanity. "
According to the British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT), Chief Executive Officer Dipolar Kim said: "This is the key time to combat AIDS.
If it is really targeted at the needs and risks of the population, the pre-explosive drug prevention has provided an opportunity to change the British AIDS epidemic.
Since the beginning of the 9th month, the high-risk groups of HIV will be funded through the NHS, which has been launched in England to obtain a new allowable tool, which is truly unique, without consultation with sex partners, which will improve the lives of many.
We support this announcement with both hands."
The chief executive of the Hiccan Trust Foundation, Ian Green, said: "The primary mission now is to ensure rapid deployment of the test within the country, and not one of the HIV infections will fall.
Now we've bought PrEP test drugs, and we've been preparing to protect over 10,000 high-risk HIV personnel."

High quality life: application of the building and artificial design to build a spacious house for the little Bourbon apartment
Joannie Ray was once a banker, and she was very excited about the construction of the house, and in 2014, she moved from the big house to the little Bronze House.
This apartment is located in a beautiful Queen Anne's Palace -- Johnny didn't pick up the clothes to sell them, which is a powerful proof of the new design.
"Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on the beach," said Joannie.
"I was looking for a house that was suitable for the price.
I saw this apartment in the Bronze Age, and it's a very high ceiling.
I'm very concerned about it that day."
Since the first visit to the house, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now completed the entire inspection.
This apartment was originally a complexed unit -- which needed to go through the kitchen and go to the bedroom -- Johnny wanted to add storage space and a roof to make full use of a full-time ceiling.
"I want a high ceiling, a large window, full of light.
That's my request," she said.
For this, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck&Shed's building and design room (in Noding Mountain) to use this 12.5-foot-high spaceboard and to construct a house that was not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceilings is insufficient to increase the two outer spaces, so the challenge of building is to create a high-performance building.
Elvan needs to be creative so that he can solve this problem.
"The structure is very complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange a good space to put it on the top and don't need a back-up.
Not only is it so simple with a simple platform, but it is also necessary to launch these materials to make them at appropriate heights for the performance of the function. "
By means of this arrangement, Elvan can access two fully-fledged rooms in that space -- which can add a lot of fun elements.
The building uses the Retrouvius label's recognizable glass window, which can attract impressive areas of life.
The gold furniture with mirrors, the small silverware and Serge Mouille have been recognizable for the whole style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing space and light.
On the two sides of a short walk, it can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, with a mirror, it's like a window in another room.
In the closet, a boy with a mirror provides a storage space for Johnny to store food and glassware.
The beautiful hotel has an attractive space that can be picked up when the kitchen is not used.
It's not new.
But the unique feature of this broken-out kitchen is at the entrance of a garage.
"This concerns knowledge in some fields of engineering," Elvan explains on the door of MDF.
"This is a balanced principle, so when you push it, it's easy to jump."
Because of the skillful use of space and storage, Joanne gained 16 square metres additional, more than one bedroom and an improved building.
"At last, what you sell is the house-room- or say your property value is based on the house-based structure," Elvan said.
" Basically, the owner of the premises will go into the room and calculate according to the size of the building. "
They would try to increase the ownership of space, while using quality materials, thereby creating a sense of humor for this space.
Elvan said, "All the material is your own choice, so it helps create new emotions in the home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't touch your heart."
The fact that, through good design and an additional set, the standard apartment can become a surprise to you.
Actually, you might be like Johnny and choose to stay.

The two brothers played a five-billion-dollar civil war in the capital.
After the formation of his Italian family, 40 years later, two brothers had a value of over $5 billion, and one of Victoria's largest settlement empires fought for war.
Colin De Lutis, former director of the Colin De Lutis football club and developer, lived in a rented house in the Tukara district, where three doors were the home of his brother Paul, who later told him about the division of their estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul had always wished to leave the family business, but the two brothers had a strong argument about the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The two brothers and their mother had 38 estates, worth more than $5 billion, which had been collected since the family purchased the Colinwood district street in 1973.
There, the family created Westco Jeans and gradually developed it to 160 households' size.
In 1999, the company was sold at a price of $85 million.
The money was then invested in the property. At present, the group of assets of the D.R. family includes the City Office, the Non-Landrick and Solento Development Project, the Golden Sea Bank and the Bloe Mountains, as well as the Regional Procurement Centre.
According to the agreement reached with his former father, his brother Paul had approximately two thirds of the company assets of Colin, the "primary proponent and dominant person" of the D. Ruttis family, and Paul was about one third of them.
The documents submitted to the Tribunal indicate that it is estimated that Colin had the property value of $3.16 million and that Paul had the property value of $176 million.
Paul felt that the distribution of non-movable property and cash proved to be a trading venue.
" The property allocation proposal made by Colin left him the best property I think is the best " , he wrote in a first court declaration in 2015.
On Friday, following several failed mediation, the Supreme Court held its hearings for the first time.
Now, these two brothers are still fighting for the control of existing enterprises, and Paul says Colin has taken him out.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of being powerless to manage certain non-movable property.
In an earlier statement submitted by Colin, he expressed his wish to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition has decided that the family is the most important choice, and my Italian blood is the most important family," he wrote.
The costs of the case continue to increase, as well as hundreds of pages of declarations, e-mails, as well as reports by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, and Allan Myers, QC, and the company's senior law firm, which was hired by both parties.
Ms. D. Ruttis and her deceased husband, Luigi, were both Italian immigrants. They began to operate in the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s, they bought a store in Bronzek.
They used the condoms to buy the Colinwood industry, and Colin opened the family's main kitchen.
Colin says, "I read three times," and he created Westco, "then Paul was very small (about 10 years old). "
Anna De Ruthis said that she and Louisi, who died in 2012, wish to be able to transfer property and land to their son.
"Louiji often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court at the end," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the D.R. Group, and Colin said that when Mark left the company, he paid $1 billion to him and paid $26 million to Luk.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were "not satisfied with their share of their property."
According to Eddie McGuire, a document published in 2015 was published on television by Eddie McGuire, although Colin was a member of the board of the former AFL club.
"Fairfax Media has contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
But only by reply, Colin, he said, because the case had been submitted to the court " I can't really say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very difficult," he wrote.
In 2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
He said, " Our father did not wish to see Paul and me at the end of this dispute " and added that he " still had hope of resolving the dispute."
Friday, this hope seems to be destroyed.
"Our problem will soon be resolved by the Court," Colin wrote.

The new Prime Minister's plan to limit the media time of President Tranpe
Others have tried, but they have failed.
John F. Kelly may be able to do it.
If that's true, he's the first one.
According to the U.S. Political News website Politico, the new White Screen Chief Plan restricts the transmission of information to President Trenmpey, including the media report, in order to ensure that the boss is more stable.
The following is a paragraph taken by journalist Josh Daasi:
"When the new Prime Minister, John F. Kelly, started working for the first day with senior officials, he pointed out that he was going to solve a major issue of President Trenmpey's entry into the White House: spreading bad news into the President's hands."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President make a better decision, and that information would be needed by his hand — either in writing or in the form of briefings.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried to wear it through watching Tranple's media, but ultimately failed.
President Tranp's TV set has been a long time -- now in the White House, he sees the habit of watching TV.
In February, former elective consultant Sam Naberg told Politico: "If the candidate Tranup is disturbed by the unjust reporting, he will know that he is also in a reliable way that will be of great benefit.
At the time, Tara Parmérie, in Politico, wrote that " according to the experience of six former electors, the focus of the practice of controlling Tranquid's tweets was to ensure that his personal media information was always included in certain commendations. "
It's all right.
But Tranp's habit has been "controlled" in a funny way.
Maybe these voters know some things we don't know -- that if they don't have an intervention, Tranp's tweets would even get hotter.
We may never know the tweets that Tramp didn't send.
If his staff can save him from the fire, no matter how many times, their efforts are worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Tran's controversy from taking place.
Some of the problems are in a white hole composed of a group of competing groups, and they are gradually promoting their activities by delivering reliable and reliable information to Trannon.
Politico — all about this story — has been reported by various advisers in May to provide questionable information to the presidential strategy.
This is an example described by journalist Shane Gudman:
" Currently, with the former General of Trent, he claims that the reaction to the negative media is like a flash of fire, especially those with devastating information that he wants to find his source.
At the end of February, a post on GotNews.com of the website of the network was copied to the President, who complained about the source of the "great amount of information revealed by the White House" by Deputy Director Katy Walsh.
Even though Johnson had been sentenced to permanent detention, he had not provided any specific evidence, and he had been exposed to a great deal of wrong quality, and subsequently openly denied it.
Trenmpey looked at the article and then began to ask officials about Walsh. "
Gudman also said that the then Chief of the screen, Reins Pribas and White Secretary Robert Port, " had tried to establish a system to manage and record the documents received by the Tarnamp."
What's the result?
Kelly was going to do the same thing, three months later.
He may be able to prove himself a more effective manager of the Pipribas, but Tranop or the Tranpin of the movement, while his assistants are still competing and fighting for influence.
These eternal impact factors will make Kelly's mission difficult.
Tourists: How do you drink?
[Summer] The potential of the small town was gradually awakened.
Today, these small towns, which are the most beautiful tourist destinations in China, will also provide important assistance to me in the construction of the most beautiful tourist destinations in China.
It's in the air.

It was reported that over the three-day holiday period of this year, Anguilla tourists were more than 650,000.
In Zhao, a small town like Anhu Guangu, a unique town of St. Rochbo: the beautiful landscape of the West and the warm atmosphere of the South Sea; the white walls of the province of Zhao-Qaowa, all of which speak of the thousands of years of Guanao City; the Tao-Sanese civilization, and the traditional and modern-dayly rich lives of fishermen... these small towns are the "hands" of Zhao-Shuang, as well as the "heart love" of eight visitors.
In recent years, the potential of this small town has been gradually awakened with the progress of the tourism building in my province.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially published "How to create a small-scale tourist resort in the province of San Francisco", which introduced a five-year period of time to name about 100 indigenous peoples, eco-environmental beauty, and urban tourism-rich urban tourism.
Today, these small towns, which are the most beautiful tourist destinations in China, will also provide important assistance to me in the construction of the most beautiful tourist destinations in China.
The relevant authorities of the Provincial Tourism Board introduced that, under the heat of the construction of the small tourist resorts, my village now places more emphasis on the construction of the individualized tourism industry, and that the new tourism projects and industries are not poor, and that they have produced a rich experience for visitors and have won a good reputation.

Small tourist resorts need air conditioning elements, tourist elements, service elements and environmental elements.
In this context, tourism services facilities and the environment are also very important.
If the weather is slowing down, it will also make the visitor better aware of the nature of the small town.
In this part of the time, the group's most warm co-operation company, together with the entire media centre, set up a series of "smokers" versions of "smokers" to promote the concept of "greens", to promote the concept of "smokers", to promote cultural tourism awareness and integrity of the inhabitants of small towns, and to create a beautiful tourism environment.
This is one of the highlights of the 2017 Summer Summer Festival.

Because of the small town of tourism, people are attracted to it, and it's the main source of it.
The beauty of the tourist resorts is not only the source of the rainwater, but also the tradition of long-term culture; the village’s reviving, which is the source of cultural confidence.
On-the-spot international, small towns, small towns in the Netherlands, small towns of Charlestown, small towns in southern France, with a golden fan, a "song" and a Southgua as a core attraction, attracting large numbers of tourists around the world every year to the achievement of tourism to facilitate the economic flow of small towns.
In the case of small towns, the focus of "extremely special and remained rural" has given the small town a clear personality and spirit, more than a cultural background, a local script, and a clear culture of rural culture.
The tourist resorts, with cultural and rural landscapes in New, with human and visual features, link the visitors to the Quartet, transform the traditional nature and culture into a shared partnership.
In essence, the small tourist resort is a complex open area of tourism and should be more than a living space shared by local residents and visitors.
As a major part of the future growth of tourism, tourism is not only possible to change rural environment, economic development, industrial development, but rather to eradicate urban infrastructure and awaken cultural recovery in rural areas.

Italy's strong attitude towards the rescue ship for migrants in non-governmental organizations
Italy warned non-governmental organizations operating on the Mediterranean rescue ship that, if they did not sign new operating management standards, they would have to continue to implement rescue.
When the Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti accepted the " Press Day " interview, he said: "It is difficult to see what they would think would happen if non-governmental organizations did not sign a new code of conduct. "
On the day before the warning was issued, Italy's official arrested the persons on a ship belonging to the German Youth Assistance Organization, who had doubts about the fact that they were engaged in trafficking in human beings, helping illegal migrants.
The assistance organization operates only one year and refuses to comment on the specific allegations of the Italian Prosecutor Anbrogio Cartosio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that "for us salvation is now and will be the most important thing, so we regret that we cannot now operate in the area of salvation " .
" After all the information has been collected, we can now only assess all allegations and situations. "
Iuventa, the Italian official, has been watching the "Young People Ask" organization since the tenth month.
The members of their vessels are suspected of carrying human trafficking directly from small ships and allow them to force the passengers to flee and re-use the ship.
According to the record of the Prosecutor, at least one such meeting occurred on the seabed of the Caribbean Coast, 1.3 miles [3 km], which was published by the Italian media.
Its crew were publicly unaware of the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which was based on humanitarian zeal, not on any other motive for monitoring relief operations in the region.
According to the rules of conduct, only a Italian police officer was clearly required to monitor their activities on board.
Currently, only three of nine non-governmental organizations participating in the search for salvation have agreed to abide by the rules of conduct, namely: the Help of Children, the Pro-Activa Open Arms, in his migration station in Mali and Spain.
On Thursday, they claimed that the new provisions were not necessary, but they could be accepted, because they would not bring any " significant changes and obstacles to their relief action".
There are no national doctors (MSF) of Nobel Prize-winning Organizations who reject their signature.
At the same time, Minniti has been claiming that the number of immigrants who have arrived in Italy for a few weeks has shown that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal defence of Libya and the efforts of the joint local mayors have been effective.
The minister said, "Several days ago, we began to see the light on the street all the time."
He announced the plan for this month's intensive dialogue: to negotiate economic development activities with the Libyan Mayors and to discuss with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries to Europe.

In December, my country's industrial investment level was running, but the base investment had little improvement, so it was expected that fixed assets investment would remain in November.

Michelle Carter himself being sentenced to death for sending a letter to Conrad Roy.
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for murdering a male by letter and phone.
The 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be sentenced to 15 months in prison and will be sentenced to five years in prison.
Konrad Roy was sentenced to an indiscriminate murder on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father will say on Thursdays: "My family is disappointed.
My son is my best friend."
During the period of the appeal, Carter was permitted to remain free of charge.
She had been in prison for more than 20 years, but her lawyer's team thought she and Mr. Roy had a mental disorder.
At the trial, Carter stood up, dressed in red and brown shirts, held hands, covered his eyes, and looked down.
" Her act killed Conrad Roy, the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life in a better way for her life.
She didn't take responsibility, the prosecutor said.
"She didn't want any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence, she felt very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find her "age or maturity, even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying, "I didn't feel for one day to lose my beloved son.
I hope he is proud of everything he has done for me and me, and I'm trying to be with his sisters in all my suffering, and these suffering will be with us forever," said.
Camdyn Roy's sister, Mr. Roy, testified that because she knew she could never take part in her brother's wedding or become his daughter.
"The loss of a person who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and my life will be filled with such pain," she said.
The case appears to have been a legal precedent, as the laws of the state of Massachusetts did not provide for the criminalization of others.
In 2014, Roy was found dead in an oxygen tank in a car; this year, Carter was 17.
The letter of Carter revealed that she was concerned about the country after her suicide.
"On the roof, the floor, and a lot of ways to hurt herself. " She said in a few letters sent two weeks before his death; then he and his family were on vacation.
At the time before he killed himself, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad," "what you're doing is starting the generator, and then you'll get free and happy."
Judge Monez said that Carter was concerned about Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to benefit from any media in the case.
There are legal differences in the present case.
A small number of people under Carter's defense, Amanda Knox (Amanda Knox), one of whom she was charged with killing her British roommates in Italy in 2007, and two years later declared innocent.
30-year-old Ms. Nox said in a special column published in "Loving Time," "Michael? Carter is worthy of compassion and help, not imprisonment. "
The art is considered to be a controversial film artist, since he started filming the first movie "red-and-white" and he has received a lot of disparaging talks while he has been leading the Chinese film competition.
Newspapers were informed on 2 days from the Lassa Netball Club, and recently the Lassa Tassa Youth Group received the fourth of the National Youth Ballistic Games in Beijing.
The LASA youth group is composed of 11 members of this group, who are trained as a assistant to the LASA adult team.
We're going to Beijing before we're going to the finals.
The LASA Group's director-in-chief of the LASA Net Ball Club said that there has been progress compared to last year, and that the team's achievements have been significantly increased in confidence and the ability to race. The exchange of players and other teams is also more comprehensive, and the exchange of the lower ground is easier and easier.
Following the end of the match, the Chief of the Competition stated that he wished to work hard for the football business in the West by participating in the accumulated experience of the game.
It is understood that in Beijing's game, footballmen have overcome factors such as low seabed oxygen and display Western images.
Despite the fact that the Thames were the gold medalist in the Oswest, the name of the Thames will be more than a smoker in the air.
The car manufacturer is in a crash. Ody's going to convert up to 850,000 oil cars.
The previous day of Ody's announcement that Boma would provide software upgrades for 350,000 multi-car vehicles.
President Boma said that she believed that "the driver had more discretion than the limit," meaning that the major cities of Europe - including the Bomare Company headquarters in Dimonir - would consider prohibiting or restricting oil vehicles.
On Tuesday, Damler announced that Europe's 300 million Meseders car would be refurbished to reduce its oil emissions.
No company declared this to be repeated.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States have made great efforts to promote the use of oil vehicles in order to achieve CO2 emissions.
But carbon dioxide released by oil is considered to be the cause of cancer and may lead to cancer.
The cost of the installation of the equipment in the vehicle is also increasing, so it is difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of the fuel vehicle.
When the German car manufacturer was reviewed, the government led by Prime Minister Angra Murkler was also accused of being too dependent on the presence of those powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These vehicles are trying to avoid overloading the public, that is, concealing their use of the so-called failure device, adjust their emissions in accordance with the rules of the vehicle test and restore normal conditions under normal driving conditions.
Many high-ranking officials were charged in the United States, while others were receiving investigations from two coastal States in the Atlantic.
Last month, Ody was arrested in Germany by the head of heat sciences before the Department of Motor Development.
Former manager Zachiro Giovanni Parmio was an Italian, and therefore no extradite protection could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Odi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the general public, and the Government of Germany accused Odyssey system of avoiding European emissions requirements and extended only prior to the United States investigation.
Ody's investigation may have a significant impact on the public: the manufacturer of the Huwa car is a part of the benefits of which the majority of cars do not share.
A film from preparation to show, from two years to a few years of history, can be called an empty show.
The film will be released on July 8th, from the preparation of the film to the show!
The original author of the "Great Seas" was a 21-year-old filmmaker from the University of Chihuahua, and he was created with a good friend-in-law on the other side of the day, and in 2008 he obtained a risk investment of millions of dollars from the United States of America, which started filming women as "the Great Sea".
In the creative stage, the film has received a large amount of awards abroad, more recorded by the French modern Art Centre Bon Pidu and is regarded as "one of the most outstanding art".
For six years from the creation of the calendar, the film has been described as "divorce".
"The Great Sea of Fish" describes an amazing story belonging to the Chinese people, which, with the publication of this document's forecast, brings new prospects for all the audience.
"This is the only thing that's been done for 12 years, and now it's become real from a dream, and I'm both nervous and excited."
Zheng says, "The group is going to be mad at me with 50 percent of the budget for doing the same. "
This "world factory", which once relied on the construction of a large-scale factory, is drawing attention to those who can lead to the restoration of this city.
On the week of the activities of the Government of the Middle East City, the first financial reporters saw a number of powerful local entrepreneurs participating in the talks.
In the red-colored walls of the wall, they pointed out the prices of the unfathomable.
Accordingly, China's Association for Television Production decided to establish a joint national television drama industry to sign the Convention on Self-Government.
The Prones tree is threatened by climate change.
The cotton tree has become a symbol of the southern city of Pronese, France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Because of the persistent droughts and the presence of toxic bacteria, the tree is failing, which is trying to find solutions to the problem of scientists and farmers.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute for Agricultural Research (CRIEPAM), in Provence, said: "Proan's hair is at great risk because the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, and it has been greatly reduced in the spring, and it is raining in the spring.
This will affect the life cycle of the tree tree.
There's also a smaller muscle, one that can spread tiny particles, and they're going to appear in a very complex atmosphere. "
The key is greater than its number.
The clean linens are not only attractive to the vacationers, but are also followed by the sugar and sugar industries.
Eric Jones says: "There are a lot of flowers that can be opened with a lot of long-distance plants, and we have a smaller, less-favoured, less- or weaker problem.
So our oil content is less."
The programme of solutions under study included the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the reduction of the flow of soil water, the protection mix of soil and water on the plant, and the development of a more tolerant species.
In comparison with the scientific elements in the film, the two main actors expressed a more attractive look at the story in the video.
On Friday, 5 September, journalists from the city of Warsaw, prominent people from many communities, as well as two performers, were surprised that they were almost silent.
One is Berlin, one is an up-to-date young actor, and the "mental crime" is the first partner to Ivan and Leek's.
Mexico's serious danger. The press were killed.
The entire staff of the Riodoc newspaper will usually meet on Wednesday, reminding them of their reporting plans for the riots in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which are caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today, tragic scenes cover themselves, and they gather together to discuss security issues.
They were told to change their everyday habits, and that's important.
Two deep-rooted journalists discussed the security of their children: they should be taken to the office (the Office had been attacked by handguns in 2009) or kept them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They let these journalists list their names under each column -- there's no evidence, no observation, no clue.
There are doubts about drug trafficking, politicians, businessmen and journalists, or cartels on the Government list, which can put Mexico at risk.
Violence never ceases, and there are more and more journalists, according to the record of the Committee on the Protection of the Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Benia Hutto in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by federal protection following attacks and threats; and up to this year, at least seven journalists have died in 7 states.
The last one died was their editor and inspiration, and also the co-founder of the "Riodoce" by Javier Waldiz Cadens.
Waldiz had written many books on drug violence, in one of them he wrote: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
Everyone can feel deeply that he's gone, even though he's not around -- a big picture tied up in the front of the "Riodoce" office, Waldiz is referring to the word "justice," and the T-shirts of two 30-year-old journalists, Alan Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, also reflect his smile, and he wears a mirror or a famous Panama hat.
The seminar was held not for two months after his death, and the journalists discussed their common injuries, dreams, sleeplessness, and suspicions.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010, only two persons were prosecuted on the basis of the records of the Committee on the Protection of the Journalists.
Most of the thousands of criminal cases per year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so little can be done to bring the killers to justice.
At Riodoce, they kept reporting the violence in Rio de Janeiro, although they had already broken their heart, although this land has been thousands of miles away.
Ivara says there's no killer information, there's no justice, so there's no use for a security seminar.
He said, "It's so stupid to spend time in such a seminar.
If we don't know why, you don't believe anyone."
On May 15th, Waldiz left the office of "Riodoce" in the capital of Victoria.
Only two men were arrested in the streets and forced out of his car and fired 12 guns, assuming that the name of the paper was translated "Twelfth River".
The man ran away from his car and broke it close to him.
Waldiz is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two grown children.
Four Korean words.
But there's nothing more to talk about Walditz than silence.
Since the last year of Guzman's arrest and extradition in the United States in 1 month, the state of Sanaaro has become the bloodiest war in the country, and the enemy forces have gone mad.
One or more people were shot every day on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, where they filled the graveyards with toxic waste.
The state of "peace" is temporarily forgotten when only one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports and routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Waldiz was well aware of the danger of this work, the 60-year-old joint "Riodoce" founder and director Ismer Bohque remained silent because he did not protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes caused this tragedy.
In the first two months, Damaso Lopez published an interview with a group of Carters who fought with some of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered these boys; the suspects were purchased by members of the group when the paper was sent to their accounts.
The second mistake was that Valdiz had not forced himself to consider leaving Mexico after his removal from the same story.
Waldiz was a traitor in Mexico and abroad, and his death was important to Mexico's violence against journalists.
His spirituality remained, his friends and colleagues believed that he was always with us.
In 2003, he was a co-founder of "Noroeste", who jointly created a 50-dollar share of $50 that year.
Boeque said, in the state of Bangalore, "the press is not likely to deal with drug problems."
As time went by, the report gained a good reputation because of its honesty and increased sales and advertising.
Journalists like to publish a direct investigation report without worrying about it, and readers like to publish stories that others are not afraid to tell.
"Riodoce" received a press award from Maria Moscabo in Latin America five years later.
The Association for the Protection of the Journalists of the Year awarded Waldiz International Press Freedom Award to show the courage he has been pursuing for the most real Mexican drug report.
He said he was scared too.
He said, "I want to keep living."
Later, in the 10th month of his interview with Rompeviento TV, he called it "in the state of Rio, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You have to take on the task on your shoulders with the journalist's identity, either in the way or in the way.
I don't want to be asked what you've done... why don't you tell me what's going on?"
"Riodoce"'s entire staff miss Waldiz, forgets him lying like a dollman, forgets his friend who never admires his advice, and knows how to live.
They depend on his custom.
He used to wear that hat.
Always go to the office on the El Guayabo bar, and always sit on the same table.
Now, they're going to ask: Did his everyday habit cause him to fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do good work and how to live.
"They don't like you making trouble for their women and children, nor do you like to influence their legal companies and the secret airport for the use of drugs.
They're all over their bottom line."
As a result, high self-review and self-defence should be maintained even when it is most safe.
Trust your conscience.
If you're in danger, get out of the way.
"Riodoce" edited by Andreis Viral says that the problem is "a feeling of being deceived... and then something like that will happen."
He and others said that the rules were no longer applicable to the state of Sinalo — just as they were no longer applicable to the state of Tamaulipas, the state of Veracruz, the state of Greero and other states, the private streets of these states, and the situation of the institutions, the corruption of government officials, the smoking of Utah.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where the "Riodoce" staff are engaged in security training, they immediately refuse to use the phone; it is said that only a few days ago, intermediation software was sold to the Government in Mexico for the oversight of journalists and activists.
Outside, two police officers walked under the trees and avoided 104 degrees (40 °C).
They are the government's offices for the protection of Riodoce, which are located in a four-level building in the middle of the Kuria district.
Some journalists joked about the fact that the police would not belong to the 50 per cent of what the governor himself said.
Newspapers have gone to the mountains for months, where drug trafficking groups are under actual control.
"Riodoce" reported three major things this week.
One of them was killed by the brother of Hurio Sessal Chavez, who had been shot by a large former bomber in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
The government's finances have also been disclosed by the Governor's House.
As well as the kidnappings in a expensive restaurant in Korea, the office of the Prosecutor is only a street area.
Officials have not published information on the kidnappings and the kidnapping process, so they need to be careful about what everyone knows about the city: that is where the restaurant is the place of drug trafficking and official love.
A journalist from public archives has learned that the restaurant is registered under a political guest's name in the Party for the Revolutionary System (PRI), which has dominated almost every political sector throughout the past century.
In recent times, the Heads of the Revolutionary System Party has been pointed to corruption in a number of cases that are of high importance.
Viral asked the journalists to write an incident at the site prior to the incident, including the incident of a son of a Mexican drug addict named Guzman who avoided military attacks.
If a couple of months ago, readers would look at the Waldiz cycle and search for the most powerful information on this kidnapping event.
46-year-old Viral, because of his physical makeup, was called "the dragon," he said "before we knew what happened.
Now all our sources of information have been blocked.
Valdiz's office is now used to collect the signs and papers of the protest against the killers, as workers have become an unintended example: representatives of the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirès took a mark from the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a travel related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adamé disappeared three days after Waldiz was killed in the western part of Michigan.
Officially found a body that was burned and claimed to be a DNA test, it was his body.
In the national context, journalists have become more and more radical, and they have organized protests and the word "save the media" on people's roads and buildings.
This day, Governor Boeque is not in Washington, he is trying to bring justice to Waldiz and to seek international support.
On the second day that Waldiz was killed, in a meeting with the governor of the state of Pananaro, Ramires accused the officials of spying the press and of telling the truth that they had killed them.
Since her anger had affected her objectivity, she also requested that she give up her position in government affairs.
Waldiz has repeatedly reaffirmed that Mexican journalists are organized into crime, with corrupt government officials and non-discovered society.
In his last book on drug news, he wrote that the journalists were not only injured by the drug trafficking group, but rather on the list of politicians and security forces who were involved in organized crime.
The Media Monitoring Group, Articulo 19, will be convicted of police and public officials more than half a year ago.
Ramires said, "In Mexico, they let you die to keep you shut up."
Clearly, these murders are cruel.
No one has forgotten six years ago that Bogotiator Maria Elizabeth Masías died at the border in northern Tamaulipas.
Her body has a letter that is supposedly signed by Zetaskater: "I'm here for my report."
Her head was cut, put on a computer keyboard and an earphone.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some press elections were closed, such as the "El Norte" newspaper in the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continue to be killed by the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo in 2014, but they continue.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez, with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or have even left the country.
It's a difficult choice.
It's hard to find jobs on the way, and they still need to be careful and alert.
At times, they will be arrested, and it is said that in 2015, photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed with four women in a Mexican city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who continue to work behind the screen, this is a daily step of high-risk policy.
Ivara once wanted to become a thief, and he admitted that the drug trade made him afraid.
He said, "Mexico is becoming a hell, so I'm becoming a journalist."
Last Friday night, the latest newspaper had been published, the editors of Riodoce sat on the street outside the office, and suddenly their phone rang.
A series of armed forces near the city of Matsaland have been identified as having been killed by 19 armed forces.
The war is also increasing, as a series of Carter information from the region has been predicted.
They're on their way through the phone to the website of Riodoce.
The next day's chapter has to be changed.
The police shouts in the vicinity of the area -- the war of death together.
There's a police officer standing there watching them alert.
If they're scared, they don't show up either.
The author of this paper has died, and on his big picture, he refers to the place where the entire state of Riodoce needs hope, following his steps.
"How do you even want to shut up? Haver was killed the same day, and the nurse asked me to send her to the street."
China's 2020 market size or breach of millions of dollars
[ Summary] In the context of increased consumption and free movement, the encouragement of national policies has been received from travel and the interest of increasing consumers.
At the same time, however, the self-sustaining self-sustainment of millions of self-sustained travel markets are also faced with two challenges.
In the large context of consumer growth and free movement, travel has been encouraged by national policies as well as by increasing consumer interest.
At the same time, however, there are two challenges to the development and market requirements of the self-sustainment industry, and on the one hand, the difficulties faced by travel clubs and travel companies, as well as the infrastructure and services faced by them are also at the primary stage.
60 per cent of the total domestic tourism, the market is expected to break down millions.
In 2016, 44 million people were admitted to domestic tourism by about 60 per cent of the total domestic tourism, and by 2020, the market size of travel was expected to be broken by one million.
According to statistics from China's Association of Road Travelers on the number of passengers leaving from motor vehicles, the number of passengers has increased continuously over the next five years and the number of passengers is more than half the number of domestic tourists.
At the same time, areas and national levels have expressed increased concern and concern about the emerging area of self-propelled travel, and a comprehensive range of policy laws relating to self-propelled vehicles, travel vehicles and explosives have been compiled between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Agency and the National Sports General, together with eight sectors, issued a "car from the Field Development Plan" and referred to the "Purchase Promotion Action Programme for Rural Tourism Development (2017), which was issued by the Department of Finance in July 2017.
Policy outputs provided opportunities and policies for domestic self-sustainment development.
It's just that it's just that it's just that it's a lot of fun. It's a lot of business.
Although the potential of the domestic self-sustainment market is enormous, national policies are actively guiding, but self-sustaining industries remain at the primary stage.
According to China's 2016-2017 self-sustained annual development report, the domestic self-sustainment club, car clubs, and car associations reached thousands, but the proportion of self-sustainment of tourists is largely due to the participation of all types of agencies such as travel clubs.
At the same time, self-sustained online tourism companies and traditional tourism companies are also attractive, many sold on the online tourism platform only by some suppliers and some self-sustainment clubs are important suppliers.
As a result of organized travel activities, it covers "food, housing, transportation, shopping, multifaceted areas, high level of distribution, higher supply chain, more affordable consumption of tourists.
In Beijing, the founder and CEO of the truck club is considered to be the same in nature and travel companies, and the early main interest models are the main activities under the line, the core of the road products and team services.
Now, however, the quality of road products in the area of travel is very serious, and the level of leadership services varies, and the needs of travel clubs are re-transmitted.
It can be seen that it is not an independent industry itself, but that it has formed a cross-sectoral, industrial ecological circle, and created a complete industrial link.
The experts noted that experience was more important than basic tourism consumption.
Therefore, the development of self-trafficking industry should strengthen the test characteristics, develop " self-trafficking+" themes and IP products.
The view isn't just the road. The parking lot should not be enough for food.
The development of the basic components of the flight is also comparable to that of the pilot.
Liqué noted that the tourism perspective was not just a road, but that it needed to integrate all the elements of transport with tourism, but that the road and tourism itself were responsible for two sectors, the increased tourism elements of the transport sector, also remained in the building, the advisory centre, the promotional facilities, and the relatively low level of tourism.
It's worth building experience for a famous self-sustainment route, the United States 66 road.
The vision design is no longer the fastest route between destinations and destinations, but it is based on the design concept of "examination of the bike" and provides the best enjoyment for self-equipped tourists; it is able to point out, link the views of tourism, preserve the historical values and cultural values of coastal ecological resources, and also provide a range of thematic activities to enhance the participation of tourists and tourism experiences and create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to the view, the camp is an important complex facility for self-sustainment.
But there are few consumers in the camp in the country who have been informed by New Guinean reporters.
They believe that many camps are focusing on infrastructure, only to satisfy their needs, to eat, to lose weight, to produce a single product, and to meet the needs of many of the components involved in their journey.
There was a lack of knowledge of the names of businessmen who had worked in the camps years ago, who had not followed the construction and service of infrastructure and after-circuits, many of which had been damaged and had no financial inputs, and it was difficult to make some of the corresponding packaging products.
Consumer groups
According to the data published by the Chinese Association of Roads in 2017, since the age of the year, the population has been estimated to be 21-40 years old, of which 31-40 years of age, of which the population has a certain economic base and a higher demand for individualized tourism, and more for family visitors.
From a housing survey, the number of tourists is relatively better than the non-standard housing.
From self-propelled types, the circle itself is the main type of self-propelled, which is 84.32 per cent.
There are a lot of people on the way out, but it's less than that.
As the demand for consumption grew, visitors of the past like to see themselves as a "visual point" begin to change their views, not as a "mouse picture" in the journey, but as a result of the experience and process of travel.
The terror is used to protect the enemy.
See, it's terrible, but it looks like an honor.
Researchers have published the first results of studies on the size and size of the Canadian miners, such as the anthills and the imaginative biodegradable rocks, which indicate that the metal is well preserved, and therefore experts call it "Monarissa in the thorong".
It preserves a very perfect rock, even though it can determine the color of its skin as red. It means it has some "hard experience".
The relevant reports in the journal "Old Biology" describe it as "the best preserved nylon ever discovered, and one of the best horrors in the world."
The rock is a new species of condensation, which lives between 1.1 billion and 1.12 billion years ago.
Its storage condition is very complete, it surprises researchers, they describe it as "very exciting to watch."
According to the National Geographic Journal, the tree is the most complete conservation of the same species of tyrannism that has ever been discovered.
Shawn Funk (Shawn Funk), on 21 March 2011, was found at the sinking of the Sancoll Valley mine mine near McMerriburg, northern of Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he encountered something that seemed to be different from the stones around him, so he decided to take a closer look.
After that, what he discovered was sent to the Royal Natural Museum of Terrigo, Canada.
The six-year study revealed the true face of this animal in the soil of 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
After such hard work, the final result is now to be published.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said the first writer, Caleb Brown.
"It will be one of the most beautiful of science's history, to preserve one of the most perfect characters of terror -- Monarisa in the throne."
By studying their skin, researchers have discovered that this plant, although depleted, is like a walking tank, but there may be a serious threat to food terror.
The corpses of this body are used as a means of protecting the food of the red-whites and using so-called "removing" magic, which is also used by many modern animals.
The expert said that through this method, it could be better integrated into the environment and thus avoid enemies, thus showing that it was fed by a greater terror.
This 1.1 billion-year-old biology belongs to a member of the Consortone family, who was the first news in May and is currently being shown in the Royal Biology Museum.
Mark Mitchell, one of the team's team's technical staff, conducted a study on it and named it "Borealopetta markmitchelli".
The preservation of the sample was very complete, thus enabling Dr. Michel and the international scientific team to record the maps and shapes of the fragments and fragments on it.
They found "retrospective" art, which is a common form of defense in the animal environment, which means that the back of the animal is darker than its side.
Despite the fact that the anticoagulant art is common, the results have been surprising, since the body of the dragon is far more than the present animal of the anti-smoker.
This terror is faced with the pressure of the slaughter of meatthrobes, which leads to a favourable rise in direction and enables them to hide in the grave as a means of survival.
However, most of the animals that exist, such as cattle, horses or goats, are as small and vulnerable as the fish, which shows that the animal is faced with real life-threatening pressures.
"The great-grandmother's being caught by crazy prey shows how dangerous it is to be eaten by the white shark," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its film likewise shows the red color of the Tron.
Scientists are continuing to study the lifeline of the animal, including its frozen content, in order to find food that is finally in place.
They believe that the terror fell into the river at the time of death and was subsequently crossed into the Great Sea and finally submerged in the bottom of the sea.
At that time, the weather in Alberta was as hot as today's climate in the southern state of Florida, and rivers and oceans may be more deep in land than they are now.
Brown said: "It's really amazing because it's completely covered with the sandy skin that has been preserved, and, to date, it's stored in space, so that its original shape can be preserved."
" Consequently, the shape of the species is almost the same as that of the white whale.
You don't need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping."
The period of the White Cross was the time when the great-footed terror of the two-footed terlons was on the ground.
Despite the fact that the queen was a king in the throne, it appeared a million years after the Queen was killed by some of the ancestors of the Queen.
They include a six-ton, 38 feet (11.5 m) deep.
The latest research found that scientists who now believe in the journal "modern biochemist" believe that after the end of the cycle, the moon was destroyed into the sea and then formed a tree in the dust.
On 21 March 2011, Sean? Funk buried the animal in the thousands of mines near McMerriburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-selling terror, and it is perfect from the bone to the bone region.
This is about 18 feet (5 m), weighing 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's two 20 inches from the edge.
The researchers believe that such agro-nutrition measles terror is now active in the western regions of Canada, followed by the explosion of floods into the sea.
However, this terror buried beneath the sea affords its weapons for complete preservation.
This special sample preserves very well, and keeps the remains of the skin covered with uneven pieces on the thoron's head.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this level of preservation is as striking as the colors.
I see it as hard to believe.
The remains of the remains are still covered on the remains of the pellets buried on the thoron’s bones.
It's sitting on its right side, five feet up.
I can print out his metal statistics."
Journalists are aware that the addition of natural or plant-based acidic acids, phosphoric acid and acidic acid supplements to the production of ODPs can make a significant increase in the production of traditional ODPs, the formation of ODPs, and the use of ODPs more common than 5~10 percentage points.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for crop growth is evident, particularly in the case of large-scale value added phytosanitary sources of BB.
The total number of security personnel will be more than the number of security officers of the London League in 2012.
In order to ensure the security of Rio, Brazil will launch the largest security movement plan in history.
In the past, the Government of Brazil indicated that 8.5 million military and police personnel would join in the fight, including 20,000 soldiers and 6.5 million police.
Most soldiers will be responsible for the defense of the oyster station, while the new 3000 soldiers will be responsible for the international airport, the security of the railway station and the streets.
The police are in other local patrols in the city, including railways, public roads and roads.
It was reported that there are currently 6,000 soldiers who have arrived in Dario for Osman Security Services.
In addition to being responsible for the four major districts of Rio, they are also responsible for patrols on main roads in airports and airports.
The introduction of an evaluation mechanism in the service sector has not been new in order to make the evaluation mechanism more effective and less effective.
How did the progressiveist learn to answer the question, "Who's the road?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrer was heartbroken.
On the first day of the trip to New York City, this Saint Louis sat in love to rent a living room and watch the face on the phone.
She suddenly found a high-school nurse.
It says, "The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and the kid was lying on the street."
She found that no one else had published this information on the e-mail, and she felt confused.
A @TheePharoah user keeps sending her the motion.
Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was not armed with weapons, was killed by a white policeman in Fuggson, Missouri.
He laid a picture of a bronchial body lying on the street, and his body lay on the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," thought Ferrer.
But death is nothing new to her and her communities.
She left the phone until that night she reopened the tweet and read about the tweets gathered by the people of Cafield.
There's a picture of police videos and people calling it, and a picture of a man named Brown's father, and it says, "The Frogson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a local police station with a dog stand in front of a group of protesters.
She said, in another video, another cop raised his gun and said, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell recalls.
"It's not what we're used to, it can be called a typical murder. "
At that moment, I felt so angry.
I'm angry, I'm crying."
She's scheduled for a return trip, and she's home the next day.
At 11:00 p.m., she took a six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrel and Ferguson, the theme of a new film "Who's Street?" on August 11 in the camp.
This is a story relating to living and protesting, love and loss, power and persistence from the community, which is full of answers to the demands of those who live in this community.
When Ferrer and his daughter, dressed in a flower dress, drove off to Försen, two people again discussed a number of topics they had discussed before that morning -- "The experience of black people and the situation of black people."
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people must fight for their faith?" she recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, that's not right.
I have to take her, "Ferrell.
"What's going on today is all that's going on in the past.
She wants to know, see and get out of this thing.
She not only needs to develop well in the promotion of advancement and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of the experience of black people and the situation of black people, and to know what we must do to gain freedom and freedom.
Even though I'm happy to give her the experience of racism that she has not experienced on her own, she has nothing to do with other black girls.
If I protect her in this case, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at the first station in Fuggson, a place facing the South Florida police station, where the attackers became their camp after the end of the prosecution of police officer Darlen Wilson.
Ferrel and her daughter were in contact with a local business manager who was making lunch.
They're ready for the bags and they're responsible for sending the bags to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of action.
She said, "My enthusiasm for progress has changed completely after the 9th day of August, when Colonel St. Louis of the State University of Missouri, she was the president of the Association for Minority Nurses and was concerned about the food justice and health gap in the black communities.
"I have no organizational experience.
It's all here."
A few weeks later, Ferel met with a film director, Sabakh Foljan, during a night's journey.
Flajan says she and her film director, Lucas Alvarado Fare, just wanted to record what happened.
"Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion is caused by many of these cases: people -- usually white people -- enter a community to benefit from their suffering and hardship.
As Florian explained in his recent interview, "we have heard that the people of Frogson's native village have not focused their voices, and we want to do it differently."
Flavia has already been in contact with the co-director of Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his campaign against the prisoners of death.
His involvement led Ferrer and the other six locals to join the project team "Who's street?", which continued to leave within a few years after Brown was shot.
"This film is not one to speak to us or to us, it's our speech."
"I'm primarily concerned about how these people appear, because it's also the way I've been exposed."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrel's experience -- but to show this movement "not about the leaders of the world's salvation, but about community cohesion," Flajan said -- the fact that she was the most open of the film participants.
As a result, "Who's street?" It's amazing to record Ferrer's personal life, such as in love and marriage.
"I feel like I'm so proud of myself," Ferrell laughed when he first saw the produce.
"But I understand that doing this work and humanizing black people must have some degree of vulnerability. "
In addition, Ferrel's story reaffirmed and re-established the role of black girls in a wider black-life event.
Two of the three founders of the campaign -- after a young black youth, Trevan Martin, in 2012, was created on social media #BlackLivesMatter -- was identified as cool.
"The women of the blacks in the leadership are all behind this movement," Ferrel said, "because we are fighting on many fronts.
The black girl must bear all of this. "
Folly agreed and referred to "The movement has truly been supported by black women and many blacks who are cool women."
Because of her identity, Ferrel was chosen to be the center of the video, but she insisted that "it's not a certain action on the matter."
"She's a man of power," she said.
"Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence, because in the lives of these crossing paths, as a black girl, you have many things to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
At the same time, in Ferguson, the press camera had already disappeared, but ethnic tensions between communities and the police remained.
Because of trying to block the high road during a journey, Ferrer was sentenced to more than two and a half years in prison.
She described the social political context of the region she called home: "A bad group. "
Nevertheless, since she was on the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has been holding on to the sacred song that she has tried to remember.
"We have the responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have the responsibility to win.
We have to support each other in love.
We're no longer lost, except for the lock on us."
In fact, online translation services have been provided over the past ten years, and in fact, it has not always been heard of the "the machine will soon replace mankind".
Similarly: DNA created by the artist using Chelsea Manning
There are a number of faces in the exhibition center of the New York Freedman Museum: white, black, and colour, and there are almost the same areas that are difficult to detect, which are lined up from the ceiling.
Dewey-Hagborg was created by the artist Hitherto?
Mannin, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison by intelligence analysts, was sentenced to 35 years in prison because of a secret diplomatic e-mail from the prison in Lvivsburg.
On the opening of August 2nd, the title is "the same."
This is the result of two years of communication from Duwei, Hamburg and Manning. Duweh Haggberg linked his studies with his own technology, computer science and art, while Mannin was a well-known different statesman who went to prison and completed his shift operation. The former President Obama, three days before the end of his term, forgave her the rest of the sentence.
Through a computer analysis from Manning's DNA, he created 30 images of "very likely appearances" that heterosexually commented on this. His comments were both about the multipurpose of DNA and about the concept of identity itself.
The name Bradley Edward (Bradley Edward) was publicly recognized as a woman at the time of her birth. In 2013, she was convicted of 20 allegations, including 6 inter-law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was blocked, with only one picture, with a dark white picture of herself, apparently uncomfortable, sitting on the floor, wearing a golden falcon.
In 2015, Hitherto Habog achieved great success in her 2012 project " Stranger Visions " .
In that work, she used the evidence from the middle court of tobacco and oral sugar, DNA derived from the fracture, to create a possible similar 3D image of a similar person.
That's an e-mail from Paper magazine.
"They want to visit Chersey Manning in prison and need a picture of ", Hiccup Harbog spoke to the media at the opening.
She couldn't visit and take pictures at that time, so they contacted Shelse and asked if she was interested in producing DNA photos.
Thus, this artist and her prisoner had become an impossible friend and had exchanged many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book "pressure's head," written by Shoili Kanungo.
And Obama asked her to be released a few days after she was published, perhaps a coincidence, when Manning was in the Kansas military prison for the seventh year.
In addition, the exhibition is of another depth, because the Government of the United States of America has consistently declared war on the government's secretaries and the rebel soldiers, while finding new ways to break up on Twitter, that the exhibition is going to be combined.
When asked about all this special occasion, Hesserduwi Habog said, "There is a reason for anything."
In an artist's statement written on the wall, Manning's super-significant sign below (in the name "i" with a heart drawn up) called for the end of "sex, sexual orientation and cultural-based conflicts."
On the wall is her linear DNA sequence, with a cross-section of Cs, Gs and As symbols.
By including 200 letters (or nuclear acids, each complex scientific dictionary of the artist), Hesserdowei Habog wants to express at least in the biological structure, and people are like that.
"I hope people get out of this situation, our gene group doesn't care who we are, how we read, how we read, what the subject is, "Hesserdowie Habog says, his 2007 film works "false memories" are also being displayed.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so that's 30 of them."
The last piece of the show, in one room, comes from a page in the front page of a small note.
Shows the U.S. soldier's hand under the loudspeaker, a man of the same type as Kim.
"When they stop your talk, they won," wrote on the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"These contents came directly from her writing to me," said the artist from the city.
"I'm afraid again, I'm still telling you."
Mannin hasn't seen the show himself, as predicted in the comic book, but when she did it, she would be welcomed by her own DNA mirror, like a group of protesters at the exhibition center.
It is also objective, as is the case with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the information she has written on her genetic code (5.2 meters, Manning's height).
"In the past, I put them on the wall, but I hope they think they're like a group," said Duwee Haggberg about the picture.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters with Chelsea, just as people were about to release her."
Professors of the University of the North and University of Oxford have been charged with murder.
The police indicated that a man was found to have been killed in Chicago City, and that a professor of the North American University and a student at the University of Oxford were subsequently arrested and is currently seeking suspects within the country.
The Cooke Court records indicate that the death warrants for murder were issued at a level that was not guaranteed.
According to the document, 26-year-old Connor Duranloin died of repeated injuries.
The community warning issued by the Chicago Police Department was reported to have been found on 27 July.
After the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment, they found some injuries on the victim's body.
Police claim that Connor Duranlod was dead and the investigation was investigating his murder, while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Since 2007, Lesem has served as Deputy Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of North-West.
In an e-mail statement, the Under-Secretary-General for School Relations, Allen K. K.C.B., stated that Lesem has now been away from work and has been banned from entering the university in the North.
“Now this is a criminal case, and the relevant authorities are investigating, and the University of North-West is actively cooperating with the investigation.”
Wallen is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
In an e-mail statement, the speaker of the University of Washington University said: " We have kept in touch with the British police and are ready to assist the United States investigation body as necessary. "
The statement adds that Wallen's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he could vote for himself.
Anthony Guerlerme, Chief Contact Officer of the Chicago Police Department, expressed strong encouragement to the authorities for their self-restraint.
Guillerme said, "The police have a general idea of their lands, and we are trying to find a possible location. "
Guillerme said that local, regional and national authorities were working hard to assist in the search for suspects.
Guerrelme said that the police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a secret notice that the 1008 apartment had occurred.
The police said the situation was terrible at the time.
Guerrelme said that it is still unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
He said, according to the security camera, he confirmed Lesem and Warren at the time in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lesem and the victims have a certain relationship," Guerrelmi said.
The management team of the Grand Plaza made a statement to the residents: " The police are currently investigating the timeline and background of the victims and are investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents. "
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutco said, "We will complete the world's road map for the future."
The Russian Vice-Minister Vitali Mutco stated that the implementation of the rest of the standards for the restoration of the rights of the Russian Rehabilitation Agency (RUSADA) would not take too long.
"The implementation of the road map standards has been carried out at a certain stage, and RUSADA has the right to plan and test with UKAD.
The WADA Road map has been updated in this regard, "Mutsk Thursday.
The following statement was made by Deputy Prime Minister Mutco when commenting on the second part of the "compliance with the provisions" road map of the world's anti-inflammatory agencies, which set out the criteria for the restoration of the rights of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutsco, the standards do not include anything that could cause Russian concerns.
He added, "Everything has to be declared and everything will be implemented.
And in the near future, the results will be submitted to the International Committee of the Regions [IOC] and WADA."
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list was that the Russian anti-inflammatory agencies had to publicly accept the findings of investigations by Canadian lawyer Richard McKelen of WADA on the support of Russian States for the use of incentives in their national sport.
Concerning this, Mutco said: "We are investigating that our immune system has failed no doubt.
All measures have been implemented.
But behind this, there is no national plan, and we will not recognize things that do not exist."
Mutco replied to Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Reaction Committee.
Smirnoff acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-respiratory agencies that had existed during the press visit to Russia earlier that day, but he added: "We have repeatedly said in various cases that there are conflicting positions and provisions in the report.
No one is planning to accept the report unconditionally, Smirnoff said.
Following a complaint in November 2015, WADA suspended Rusada's right to carry out an intrusion investigation in Russia.
However, this June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate investigations under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA, Director-General Olivia Niggery, at the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, said that RUSADA was "in the right direction", trying to restore its rights.

Dawwa-Sukk, President of the Croatia-Occupancy Council, expressed great interest in China's participation in Chinese wines in Croatia's football, and the number of Chinese wines was very high.
You don't have to buy any more than 8,000 products!
At an example press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on 11 January, a high-level press speaker from the Ministry of Commerce stated that, to date, our country has already entered into an effective self-trade agreement, involving 23 countries and regions, covering 8,000 import products of the remaining tariffs.
At the same time, imported rice, Iceland's three-year-old fish, Chile's red wine, Asian hot fruits... these products you want don't have to buy any more money.
At present, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, with 15 of which have entered into force and covered 8,000 non-tariff import products.
For example, as a result of the implementation of the Trade Agreement, consumers can make products from different sources of quality, quality, quality, and quality of agricultural products for a period of four years.
For example, the Asian rainforest, the floods, the tropical fruits of the fire, and the import tariffs fell from 15 per cent to 30 per cent to zero.
The import duties of third-country fish are reduced from 10 per cent to 12 per cent by zero;
Red wines in Georgia and Chile, import tariffs fell from 14 per cent to 30 per cent;
In New Zealand, there is also a greater reduction in the taxes on special agricultural products, such as beef and milk.
(c) Import duties for products of industrial origin, for example, in Switzerland, have been reduced by zero;
(c) The import tariff rate for imports in parts of the table has decreased by 50 per cent and will be reduced by zero in several years;
The import tariffs for products such as maize and maize have decreased by 40 per cent in the country's refrigerators and will be reduced by zero in several years;
There is also a higher level of reduction in such electronic products as consumption.
At the same time, retail tariff products under the Trade Area also included intermediate products and raw materials needed for the production of domestic final products, and also contributed to a certain degree to the structural growth of domestic products.
The Department of Commerce is very proud to say that almost one third of the products from my country's total imports can benefit from the treatment of preferential tariffs from the Trade Agreement, most of which are final consumer goods and bring real benefits to consumers.
Further reduction in import tariffs for consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, my country has adjusted the import tariffs for certain consumer products and further reduced the import tariffs for consumer goods, covering food, health, medicines, daily food, shoes, household equipment, cultural entertainment, Japanese packaging, total of 187.
The average rate of consumption will be reduced from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost by "square"!
Since 1 January 2018, my country has also made some adjustments to other import tariffs.
(c) Import tariffs of fractions such as lead, osmosis and salt water from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
The reduction in tariffs means that consumers do not have to purchase and that they do not need to buy foreign products that they like.
In 2018, import goods purchases: imports of red wine, nuts, fruit...
External reports: The United States of America's final market has a great deal of difference.
The new Central Network is now on 29 December.
According to the U.S. "World Day" report, the Christmas season just came back.
According to the U.S. Broadcasting Company (ABC), over half of the goods sold last Christmas were converted.
In addition, a number of readers have been deceived into buying explosives online and consumers need to be more concerned about purchases of non-formal websites.
In general, large purchase companies have formal and reasonable repurchase procedures, but if they buy gifts or electronics from small shops, they must be careful.
Ms. Rolang's local lady, who bought a package at an online store on December 1st, which was a special sale of her printouts, had bought over $60 (U.S.), and has not yet been sent.
She sent the mail to the guest, and I didn't see her again.
Other online explosives, last year in U.S. tourism, bought a cell phone to third-party sellers, and then sent in a box of dust.
If you know that you have been deceived, you can apply for a discount to the website and get a full refund.
However, there are also customers who believe that the website's discount service is not a percentage perfect.
One of the Secretary-General of the United States of America said that there had been two purchases of a site ' s emergency delivery services, four of which had not been delivered at the same time.
Then again applied for retirement, and no reply was received.
Large markets or areas of purchases have a better return policy.
Macy's spent most of its 180-day full-time withdrawal.
But the goods must remain "like" and have to buy certificates such as receipts or bank records.
If there is no evidence, customers can also obtain a market share and can be used to buy other goods.
Targets for general commodities usually have 90-day delivery periods, and electronics usually 15-days.
However, the electronics purchased for the period from 1 November to 25 December 2017 for the period from 30 days to 30 days for the withdrawal of the luxury-type goods.
It is important to note that the 30-day period of withdrawal is from 25 December and is to be reimbursed until 25 January 2018.
It's very expensive to buy objects, and it's coming up with a new era for the development of goods around the world.
More than ten years ago, my country was in the market for sale, with limited choices and limited needs.
However, after decades of development, the market has already achieved a change from the market to the buyers, and now consumers are more concerned with the fact that they are no longer satisfied with the purchases of a simple "supply hand over money" that are simple.
Therefore, how could consumers get a very expensive product test that would become the next competitive point for property producers?
In many factors affecting consumer procurement, the impact of the shopping centre in the business circle is the most important.
See how city-builders focus on the acquisition of goods.
There are no two completely the same nests in the world and no two completely the same shopping centers, a famous shopping center must be of its own particular nature.
For example, Kanyon, a well-known shopping center in Turkey, was designed by a unique dormant design from Canyon, which is therefore called Canyon, and is located in the cave.
In addition to the design of the cosmos, there is a large-scale round-up exhibition in the centre of the shopping center, which is unique and often features special performances.
Because open platforms are designed to allow visitors to travel through each level to watch the activities carried out in the "Gold" and have the effect of changing perspectives.
In the country, there is a business street in South-West Forest Moor, called the main foresting area of China, where the child talks are perfectly combined with the eco-label.
7000 square meters of greenery, 3,000 square meters of surface water platform, composed of 9 individual buildings, connected between buildings, and designed the entire basement building, where the French wood-cubic trees are covered with a layer of wood, and the roofing area is made of wood.
Walking into the forest, like an unattended cave in the memory of the Elisemhurch, the surrounding trees surround the building, the trees, and the clear display of the forest, bringing people into a full of organic and active forests.
In addition to refurbishing, the well-water trade round of the Red Sea, the planning of hundreds of businesses, the future introduction of over 50 international top-level flagships, more than 100 international top-level cards and 500 country-wide brands, resulting in the collection of services, the theme of a unique commercial centre.
In addition, the water business environment also integrates eco-introducing into the public transport of TOD, leading to the gathering of goods, services, food, entertainment, education and movement in a group, and also attracting them to a unique "water culture", which will allow them to enjoy their unique water and water pleasure and to enjoy their perfect quality as a group.
It can be found in a comprehensive context that at present some of the premises have fallen under the knowledge of the discovery of this new urban business, while domestics have indicated that it is central to consumer experience and how the consumption patterns associated with the experiment will also be central to future urban development.
Now the business circle is not only a collection of goods, but more than a integration of cultural culture, a complex place of creative themes, and it also contains responsibility for the city ' s inhabitants.
Thus, while consumers are meeting the needs of a sport-based material, the greatest spiritual need for cultural art is the need for adequate housing, which must be a high point in the future development of the business environment.
In refurbishment, the rising northern coastal mountains, the north-west of the country, the proximity of the bridge, the world's commercial beauty, the international landscape, and the gathering of the first-class cards, and the close-up of international time.
It's a step forward, and it's a wonderful world.
The East Bank has a better shopping environment, and the East Bank is close to the South-South business area, and it has improved the quality of the procurement system in the West and even in the country's leading four-level transport systems.
(a) The gardening of the other two railways and the Vanda districts, where the visualization of the park has been carried out, raised 300 acres [300 m] of track, refurbishment of 40,000 square metres of land, and increased the shape of the southern trade;
And the Red Lake Lake Lake, which is close to the top of the low-floating water trade line, is the main water trade area, surrounded by nine square yards, the narrow, openness of the commercial district, making people more willing to stay, stay and enjoy the pleasure of the goods, rather than the people behind it so eagerly move forward, actually achieves the "progressive procurement".
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more intense, and how to kill a blood route in a highly harmonized market, taking into account the dignity of the "purity of goods" in the hearts of future consumers, and it is worth serious consideration by all local producers.
Only the disparity strategy is not far enough, only those who really put consumers in the heart, who are in urgent need of consumers, and who want consumers to be able to laugh at what they think is a very complex and complex purchase test for consumers in the hot air market.
Of course, to the end, I would like to be the most happy or reproducible of my children, to have such a good shopping experience and business circle, and no one could imagine today's prosperity before 10 years ago.
Section: Consumerism is eager to cover real environmental prices
1682 million dollars, which is a 24-hour transaction for the consumption of the consumer of the celestial bodies in the 24th hour of November, 2017.
In particular, after the launch of the "two 11s", a short three-minute shift in cataracts would break down 100 million.6 minutes more than 200 billion.9 hours would break 10 billion.
This day, the total number of payments made by global consumers by payment of prices rose to 148 million and rose to 41 per cent more than last year.
These consumptions will produce 8.12 million items.
And whether it's a map or a payout platform, it's all part of the Marjoon's Ari group.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that a single youth from a self-created "light" culture would be compiled by the electrician as a "two 11" shopping season at the present phenomenon level.
On 11 November 2009, Aribaba was first used for the sale of "The Big Bang": no one talked to you about love, so the "single dog" should be bought online.
As a result, the transaction rate of this celestial merchant city (the former 'the cat') fell to 52 million dollars, 10 times that of the daily transaction.
From there, "two 11" became a popular shopping season in Aruba, from the beginning of the domestic buyers ’ self-sustained pleasure to the entry of global traders, nine years ago, the price of a pair of two and a half billion transactions was more than 3200 times that of the year, making it look like "Black Friday."
And there's a lot of electricity sold to the windshields, and there's a lot of electricity.
"Kython" has its own "6.18", but no "two 11" has a significant impact this year from 1 November to 11th, and the total sales sales of "Kython".
And after "two 11" the next thing is the same thing as "two 12" and the New Year's buy-in period.
A new year passed, waiting for the annual purchase of goods by Chinese consumers and before the spring season, the purchase of goods by lovers, consumption, will not be allowed.
Over time, environmental problems resulting from marine consumption have generated concern for professionals and institutions.
According to the New York Daily Television Report, each pack of 0.2 kg of normal standard maintenance is estimated to produce at least 30 million tons of trash during the "two 11" year.
The Director of the Green-East Asian project to combat pollution announced an external dialogue that only 160,000 tons of trash will be produced this year's "two 11" package.
The National Post Office had issued a report in 2016 that indicated that the speed of the period "Bibbol 11 (11-16 November 2015) was approximately 7.8 million, using over 300 million packages, 99.2 million packages and 169.85 million tons, with a length of approximately 425 square miles.
This year, the National Post Office estimates that the speeding operation of the two 11s is expected to exceed 15 million.
In Beijing, the director of a garbage dump center informed the New York Company that the garbage from the "two 11" is more than 2000 tons of garbage every day after the "two 11" and that it is more than the processing capacity of the fuel station.
The company has already realized that environmental pollution caused by the fast-paced industry is not seen as insignificant.
Some companies, including Sonin, have launched "two 11" boxes of plastics that can be reused, which can be reused as containers of goods and trash, but which are not highly acceptable for the consumer concerned.
Maju also supports "green packaging" and "green stream".
This is more than 68,000 "sacrifice".
What kind of move do the Germans want to pay?
In the winter, there is no expectations for the war to be paid in Germany.
The micro-payment and the payment of gold has moved the war zone to Europe, the competitors have not changed, and the occupation has not changed -- the Chinese, is it globalization?
There's a place to pay for. There's got to be a micro.
In accordance with the agreement of the German electronic payment servicer Wirecard, micromails were officially launched in Germany this November and were gradually published by businessmen within Europe.
In Europe, the two "the old city" was once again divided into two countries.
It has been a long time since the payment of jewelry and micromechanicals has been a high-ranking song on the way to globalization.
In relation to the globalization of China's migration, the Advisory Council "Third China's Industrial Study on Industrial Payment 2017" compiled two types: one through strategic investment, outputs, inputs and support for foreign land movements.
It is through the consumption of Chinese tourists and the promotion of foreign trade services to foreign merchants, and further changes in the awareness and acceptance of foreign land payments to China.
Yes, the Chinese have to go down.
China's economic development is slow, as well as a large population base. China's sales in Europe are a number of people.
However, it was also stated that this time the Chinese movement in Germany was not expected to pay for the war.
The payment and payment of coins is only a move to Europe, the position of the contestants has not changed, the occupation has not changed — or the people of China, is it a globalization?
A more open survey is that China's move is possible to pay for landfills in Europe's own land?
For example, in Germany.
The new "new" sales of magic.
Amason announced his entry into the military library and cargo when he entered the world's 10-year-old shop, regardless of whether the opportunity or the motive was fun.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first bookstore in West Asia and then two libraries in Portland and Santiago.
In early 2017, Amazon opened a store in New York and planned to have at least 8 stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that no-one in the flag would operate, that customers would not need a team, that they would not need an account, that they would take the goods they wanted to leave as soon as possible, and that the purchase would automatically be removed from the Amazon account of their customers.
In the case of Amazon, it has been discovered that in recent years the movement of radio in the company store is a very rare thing.
As CEOJEF Bethosz stressed that it would not be easy to open an entity store unless it met the following four conditions:
We must be sure that this new opportunity will allow the investment of the participant to be re-reported;
We must ensure that this new opportunity is of great importance to the entire company;
We must ensure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make a difference in the face of the customer.
The library and packaging are the most popular group of two entities, as well as the first downside opponent after Amazon's rise.
While Amazon announced the entry of the two entities markets in the world, it was worth all the time or motivation.
The practices of Amazon, and the assurances in the East?
A similar voice was heard on the other side of the earth. On 13 October 2016, at the 2016 U.S. Congress, the President of the Board of Directors of Alabama made a speech on the subject.
He said: "Alibaba will no longer mention the phrase 'electronic business' from the beginning of the year.
The time of a simple electrician will soon come to an end, and in the next decade, there will be no electronic commerce, instead of 'new sales'.
The online bond with the material will produce new retailes. "
On one occasion, the three words "new sales" were the same as the magic, which were used by businessmen to hang out with their mouth.
But what does "new sales" really mean?
If it's just connected to the bottom of the line, that's not a strange idea.
In 2016, eMarketer followed the largest of 180 electricians estimated that the total sales of electricity was about $2,000 million, with the largest 25 of which accounted for $1590 million.
Of these 25 houses, 18 were traditional retailers who started working online in the last five years (e.g. Messier, Nordstrom, Target, Gap etc.).
The Arab Group has received a total of 283 million dollars in the Sunni business, and has also been experienced.
From a global point of view, retailers and electronics are moving from one channel to the entire retail system of entrepreneurships, electricians, mobility and socialization media.
Is Matthew "new sales" more a combination than a prospect for the future?
What's the difference between the concept of the whole channel, if not?
Maybe the key to the problem is not online and it won't be integrated, but how.
Recall that in the past 20 years, the price and ease of the electricity industry has been focused on the price and demand of the electricity industry, such as the rise of the retailer in the early years.
Depending on these two points, the electrician transferred high standardization products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the line.
As consumption patterns increased online and customer experience increased, the electricity industry also increased to other types of products and began to increase efficiency.
" Using the Internet's ideas and technology to reform and upgrade the existing total social network of consumers, AlibabaCEO says, "that the increased consumer demand for Chinese consumers can be effectively met and that the process of production, transport and service of all commodities is more effective because of the Internet and the widespread use of data."
The route of the electrician, therefore, is the path of a light asset and of an actual asset.
"light" means fixed assets, staffing, management processes without traditional retailing; "weighting" means large inputs, such as materials, storage, etc.
The change in the mode of flow has guaranteed the efficiency of the electrician.

On 18 January, Aruba reconvened its high-level dialogue on poverty eradication and announced a new model through the exploration of the Internet + poverty eradication.
This is a follow-up to rural strategies, to launch rural landfill projects, to launch an on-going rural poverty platform, to establish the Arab Poverty Fund, and to start a new "guarantee" for poverty eradication.
Poverty eradication is one of China's most important national strategies.
Total poverty has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"Electronic poverty is an innovative initiative that has developed a new round of poverty, and is an important player in poverty eradication.
The central importance of the Internet is that it can play an important role in helping to combat poverty, promote the eradication of poverty, eradicate poverty, and allow agricultural products to leave villages through the Internet. "
As a result, in early 2014, Ari proposed a rural strategy to calculate and globalization with large data, and listed as a three-core strategy for the future 20 years.
In the same year, Ari launched a rural bazaar project, recruiting "little village II" in rural areas, bringing farmers rich through the electricity business.
In 2017, Ari worked with the business sector to promote agricultural poverty channel, which is currently aggregating 13 provinces and 120 national levels of poverty.
There are 2118 villages in the village of Ali Square.
Of these, nearly 400 are present in the province, 33 are present in 13 countries.
In 2017, at the Chinese retail market in Aruba, the national village sales totalled $12 billion.
He expressed his courage that in the face of a national strategy to eradicate poverty, Ari had been thinking about how to make good use of the technology of the Ari economy, large data, and innovative capacities, such as innovations, and a new way to get out of poverty.
The village was the main platform for the removal of poverty by the Ari-Electronics, and a direct-release Internet-based new link to poverty.
A joint support of agricultural materials and microliquids in rural and rural areas is carried out in the breeding season.
In 2017, in the 832 national poverty camps, there were 795 slave-trafficking services, providing them with an easy-to-pay and credit service.
Birds are responsible for the sale of stocks and stocks, for the sale of pets, for the production of agricultural products and for further improvement of supply standards for agricultural products, for quality and market competitiveness.
The development of the electricity industry, not only needs products, sales routes, industrial planning, but also needs people.
Ali has achieved a combination of "poverty-sounded mind" to enable farmers to sustain their poverty, through the development of a vocational training course for standardization, qualityization and measurement of farming methods.
These courses have covered about 92 per cent of the national poverty line.
And the "public interest and commercial means" approach to poverty can also guarantee that Ali will become a "very poor" when he is in poverty.
The President of the Board of Directors of the Arab Republic stated that poverty eradication should be divided into poverty, out of poverty and resulting in three stages.
Poverty is teaching people to fish, removing poverty is teaching them to fish, creating a "fishing" for farmers, enabling farmers to eat fish.
The industrial poverty of the electric business is the production of fish.
In industrial poverty, Ari has been promoted as an example in national reconstruction by the relevant sectors in cooperation with the Solomon Islands.
Ali's poverty eradication work has also been approved at the decision-making level.
The electricity company represented in Aruba was sent online to ensure that agricultural growth was increased through online channels.
Some village workers, both small and medium-sized, were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share the experience of the electric trader out of poverty.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme Office in China has been with villages and has carried out the poverty of the electric industry in the area of the Amazon.
A new financial message was delivered by the Ari Institute, which was held on 16 January by China at the "Third New Economics Conference", held jointly by Chicoco.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important issue — the issue of globalization and its use, as well as the phase of globalization.
Many people believe that globalization is halted and that many developed and developing countries are different in their attitude toward globalization in the new phase and are different from those of the model.
The second concept is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what is the restriction of the medium-term phase of globalization?
The restrictions imposed on the economic environment are the result of changes in globalization.
Chile believes that the global economic adjustment was essentially completed by the end of 2017 and that a new cycle of growth would be introduced after 2018 and that the next cycle would be product-related.
The city's capital was officially opened on the day before 7 FRESH, which planned to build more than 1,000 hotels in the country for the next 3 to 5 years.
In addition to Ali's box, the eternal super-sex species, the Suspension, the Mesa's fishing gear, and the "new retail shop" began to build up, and even at the price of the new model.
The post-mortem post-market rise has become the theme of the new retail sector, where is the new market?
"In 2018, we will enter the country quickly, before spring, in Beijing, up the sea, and the state of San Francisco will open a large store."
The "new method" of 2018 was released at the second New Year's Conference on the 10th of March.
" Since 2018, the box has not only been a live electrician but also a live-class electrician who is now serving consumers.
The core model line is flown, tested, on the line is real sales."
In contrast to traditional sales, over-the-city, boxing was a popular "internet store" in many consumers' eyes, even among middle-class agencies, that opened the concept of "box area".
There are various advantages on the Internet for electronic platforms and under-line retailers, but consumers appear on several channels, so both parties are trying to complete the channel model.
In industry, it is believed that, in the large context of consumer growth, the "type horse" portal will increase in 2018.
And from the very first generation, it was predicted that in the new year, the retail market would become more innovative.
"For example, the online mode of operation drew the consumer's eyes, and the voice of the living supercomputer from all over the world was also called "
"But these relationships are more and more useless, and I'm willing to buy them. "
It appears that, in the company of CEOO, the new market environment, consumer habits have changed and demand has changed.
In fact, the line is broken down, the line is broken, the line is broken, the line is turned on, and now it's locked, because the consumer is no longer separated from the line on the line.
The share of capital in the dispute is to make enough of the new fuel consumption currently represented by the supercomputer.
The analysis suggests that the competition in a single city has not yet reached the level of Red Sea, and that there are still many large secondary cities to be buried, and that the market remains in large numbers of opportunities and space.
The different types of industry for new sales will bring new sales into a multidimensional development situation.
The Economic and Social Institute of the Association of China's Association for Economic and Social Affairs of Central Asia, which is a report on the annual development of China's electricity industry in Myanmar, has addressed a deal to all.
In this year, what kind of success has China's electrician issued?
What development trends are in the global electricity industry?
We're here for everyone's sake.
The total sales volume will be rescinded by a speed increase in speed.
Since 2006, my net sales in our country have been rising at an unprecedented rate, and it's supposed to be getting new and not getting out of the door, and it's cool!

But this year's situation is different, online retail resales are rescheduling, this year from 1 September to 34.2 per cent.
The growth rate for 2016 is higher than in 2015.

Help your company avoid becoming the next priority firm.
Amy Erett once wanted to see the happiness of the investigators at her e-business start-up, but the investigation had no effect.
The responses received are often inaccurate, useless, even worse, and misleading.
Even though she had committed to the use of unknown forms, some staff members still did not believe in this process.
Edret, who is responsible for managing 75 old-fashioned electronic business providers, said that "responsibility and objectivity of the response is lacking."
So she called out for help.
A new human resources initiative, such as the spring of rain, has helped the company to understand the feelings of workers.
They designed and authorized software specifically used to measure the participation of workers, thus enabling companies to conduct rapid population testing for specific groups and populations, provide the staff with names and complaint lines and, in some cases, permit the reporting to pass on to the Board a high-level direct report.
"Now, you can track your health with Strava and Fitbit tools, but where is Fitbit's company?
In three years, Erette has received further insights into the thinking and feelings of staff members using Glint.
In addition to the rapid investigation and population survey of the specific team, Glint also provided a map of the company's hotspots, which are the largest complaints, which are the lowest approved number of managers, and which is the only way to get her to understand why.
The companies began to realize that they needed to train their corporate-controlled career culture so that they would not be the next priority. A blog article describing the environment was published before pre-priority workers, and they were punished by the company, and then their priorities fell into disrepute.
For companies like Glint's original investment, this company's desire for supervision is an endless business.
Based on data from the financial technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, global governance, regulatory and regulatory value by 2020 may exceed $1187 billion.
Convertent, the original enterprise in Darfur, has been committed to helping companies to prevent and detect wrongdoing and has seen an increase in interest and activity in this regard during the earlier year.
Convertant has nearly 600 clients, including loved ones, Microsoft and Tessra.
A prioritisation of the contract as a client.
Like Glint, Convertent can send the company a "scillating" survey, which actually collects confidential answers and examines the map of its area of question.
Convert also provides anonymous mail lines to make employees report wrong.
If the Director is contacted, the complaint will enter directly into the Board of Directors.
The founder and chief executive of the Convent said: "The court has seized the authority of the regulatory body.
If a company is found to be ill-employed or to show misconduct to employees, even if the regulatory body is not involved, it may also face consumer opposition, and the high consequences of the loss of employment and involvement in proceedings are expressed by Chile.
Ruby Tuesday is a restaurant in over 500 locations and has over 25,000 registered employees, which has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees understand the work guidelines and work schedules and provide a smooth way to contact the company's headquarters.
Before that, if the staff member wants to report, it is necessary to find the company ' s telephone number or e-mail, to make formal complaints, and to expect the Headquarters to deal seriously with this.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as the legal adviser General James Vitrano of Ruby Tuesday said he did not think that there was no good way to track the complaints of workers.
But now, using the Convent, the company will be able to find and solve things that the city or state authorities do not know before they find and address -- discrimination, harassment or unfair wage actions.
"I can get closer to 360 degrees of full-range knowledge of the work experience," said Vitrano of the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Team.
"We're protecting our partner from the employment process. "
Cinland stated that, following the closure of the security of news against moral norms in the computer business in Andorra, companies began to attach greater importance to morals, values and employeeism since 2002.
But until "Societal media have entered their world," the companies realize that they cannot prevent their explosives from being spread on the Internet.
"Before we use technology monitoring, people view hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Converter both provided their software as services and collected the regular costs of collecting products to each company.
Such business models and business opportunities are supported by risk investors, which have been supported by these two primary investors.
In February, Convertent collected $10,000 from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital companies, up to $47 million in total capital.
In November, Glint received $10,000 from Bessemer Venture Partners, totalling $6 billion.
Given the interlinkage between companies, cultural and risk investment, these investments will hardly surprise people.
More and more studies have shown that staff members today expect higher jobs than they used to.
High-paying and interesting projects in a highly competitive market such as the Wall.
The employees wish to feel accepted, valued, and their time spent on a company with an active mission.
"When people are happy to join the company and feel that their voice has been heard and their work is beneficial, they will be more committed to making the company successful," says Ms. LinkedIn, Vice President of the Global Welfare and Industrial Test. LinkedIn, while using Convertcent and Glint, used both software.
Investors are well informed when their investment group is well demonstrated; the company is good when it is loyal and respectful.
If the third-party analysis tool pledged to increase the integrity and integrity of workers, they would also find financial support that would be inadequate.
The cultural experts at the workplace said that it was very important to have staff performance data.
However, these data are of no use unless the company's administrators take action.
In fact, if a company requests workers for feedback, it can be expected that the company is changing.
If change is slow or there is no progress, it may lead to disappointment and result in the withdrawal of employees from the company.
“If you want to search for 4,000 recommendations, you need to be prepared for a 4,000-time dialogue. He has seen errors that are too dependent on the data collection of several companies.
"Because if you don't follow it all, the employees will think, 'Do you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't mind, why do I care?"
Erett said that Madison Reed has been able to take action on the Glint report every month.
After collecting feedback on their feedback on decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to address the issue through the reorganization of internal corporate teams to increase communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and they long to see that they wish to be able to change in the so-called high-speed industry and better retain workers.
"If you're not committed to creating a transparent culture, you'll lose someone," Vitrano said.
"If you lose someone, you'll lose the client.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company."

NCAA cancels training twice a day and prolongs the training period for the white team.
At 11:00 a.m., a football team at the University of Los Angeles, California, spoke out in the middle of a new school course.
Some of the players have already removed the movement shoes, revealing the body that was trying to train after the first day of the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these empty minutes are time to rest.
After three hours of training, the members of the summer course will return to the final examination of the accommodation preparation, and the next morning at 6:30 a.m. to the Waterman Football Centre.
"The next three days are a setback to these guys," the Bourbon coach Jim Mora said about coming in on Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled two daily exercises (to reduce the burden of light players), but actually extended their training days to at least before the end of Friday.
That's why the first three trainings at the University of Los Angeles were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to adjust the schedule that the players have already completed.
From the elimination of two training days to more than one day, the team conducted training on a week before the previous season, and the first training on the six season in Westwood.
They planned to start 18 training courses from August 20 and then to start an official game for farmers in Cape Verde in September.
Morea said he supported the adjustment of the NCAA rules, although this would increase the number of players in the process.
"In three or four days, we'll give them a great amount of training, very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just been through, they're training, they're all great kids.
I thought Saturday, we'd have more time, really great."
At the end of the training camp, the University of Los Angeles, California, will stop training. It is not an easy task to take into account the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center's clean-up line.
At the end of this week, the Red Army will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admits that once these rooms are air-conditioned in the course of the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really worrying question, thinking that someone might rent a room and sit in the room, and that's not a good idea.
If you have a training tape, it's good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in 8 parking lot.
We'll use existing resources to do the best.
I won't worry too much about this.
We've developed a plan."

The book's going to trigger real-time verification and combat false news.
On Thursday, the book was declared to be sent to the third-party inspection body and showed the results of the investigation.
In its statement, the company stated that it would start using updated tools to study the possible harmful practices and send them to the actual verifier and that it could show the actual verification results below the original.
The book was criticized as one of the main sources of the so-called false news, and many believed that it had influenced the 2016 presidential election of the United States.

Create a picture of the story of England's castle.
In recent times, small Scottish castles have become the main focus of the production of music videos and have become the refuge of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the seventy-eighth century.
But Scotney has seen a 700-year-old motif history in the location of the Belo-Centre River, and it is now the source of the emotion described by Jamie Rhodes (Jamie Rhodes) (a special love for history documents, a man who keeps his head cut off).
"You can see the signs of the old man 300 years ago, I find it very beautiful," he said straightly.
"What kind of person is it that makes this letter fall on my hand?"
From the middle of the century to the time of Edward, "an English castle" has been read by families living in Scotland, each of which is different from that of future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book in the archive for the original material: he also wrote "the teeth and other stories of the dead in 2014," a book published by the British Library, a work completed by him with a creative spirit that was beyond his control.
He said: "When I see the impression I have left of the letter, I can't stop the writing of my own, which was written by a two-year-old agent who worked for Jacob's team in the 18th century."
"That's his finger!
And the message's always smells like a piece of smoke, because then you need some light.
For us, 300 years later, that smell makes people feel like they're on our side.
Oh, I like the text of the file!"
The support of the British National Commission on Trust and Art and lived in the city for almost four months (“in fact, my stay is a little longer”) seems to be great, and simply not to believe it.
Rose spent a few days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, reopening the archives, researching many treasures and toys in the fields, such as hanging on the wall, and passing through the bottle of several centuries in the middle of the Wall.
He used to talk to the poets in his book on the land and the ruins of old castles, and at times with the dispersion of artists in his book.
And then at night, he's gonna drink some whiskey, then write it.
The history of Skotney's secret history is still unclear, as the National Trust Organization of the British People's Trust entered completely only after Elizabeth Hesse died in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rose arrived, the staff began to handle the file, he described them as "the owners of the house hundreds of years ago: "Oh, put it in the building."
The newspaper, a letter from the British Empire, described the map of various countries: "You would think the earthquake would be boring," Roz said, but two families would make a big noise for a white tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in this work are from the beginning of the city, and the history of England is more widely studied, including "the Workers" (The Laborer), which is found to be one of those who left the new city in 1381.
The story of "Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex" recorded a tragedy that occurred in the city in 1380."
"Agricultural cultivation begins in that area, and I think it's a good place to start.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as "The Priest" (The Priest), which tells the Darrell family about a seven-year story hidden by a priest at the time of the British religious reform.
Or The Smuggler, the owner of the story, was the 18th-century traitor, Arthur Darrell, who was considered to be the funeral of himself with stones filled with incense (his remains appeared on the ground several years later) .
The Darrells is the most popular Scottish boroughs: "These gentlemen seem to be tired, they always spend money and buy things they can't afford.
For a century and a half, Darrell men, who are married to wealthy older women, have been able to resolve their debt, and I think that they should be a small boy in England and understand how to seek women. "
As he finished his mission in the castle, Rose began looking for other strange writing experiences.
He completed a little painting in the wilderness of Finland for two weeks, which means "El?m?m?nm?hki", which is a 20th century early hospital, and then was abandoned slowly.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
"I'm so sad to leave," he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I've got to face the reality of life.'
According to a news reporter, the head of the intelligent car team in China is located in the Red Sea, and the operator is implementing the text of the Vice-President of China.
Who's the richest country of the world's energy company?
Last day, a known PFC energy company published a strong list of 50 major energy companies in 2011 and a US oil-based gas producer of Ekson U.S. gas was a $40.3 million, followed by China's oil and the Dutch Royal Corps.
In this document of the PFC, the oil had been questioned in 2007 and 2009, and the other year's lead location was entirely occupied by Ekson's coal.
Among the 50 strong lists in 2011, there were three companies from within China, with the exception of the list of middle oil 2 and the 9th China oil and the 15th China Sea Oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, despite the fact that the current oil prices were far higher than four years ago, PFC Energy Company CEO noted that there were many reasons for the low prices of the general market, including the decline in gas prices in North America, and the low life expectancy in the global stock market.

The U.S. amendment of the Green Card.

In order to build an enabling zone environment, U.S.A. was built, and recently, the South-South smoke department (sub-corporate) "636 "Wild Service Team" carried out environmental security activities in the "Dann al-Airland" area.
The activities have not only been supported by the work of the Department of Public Works, but also attracted the Department of Retirement, the Family of Workers and the Environment.
This volunteer service activity is designed to protect South-South vision resources, glorify the concept of "love of others, love of society, love of nature" and enables the next generation to accept and broadcast volunteer services to the next generation.
Since the establishment of the “636” Volunteer Service Team, 16 members of the Joint Development Group have previously conducted a series of volunteer services activities, such as helping with the smoking of low-sale customers, and a series of voluntary contributions, such as the Yaan earthquake, to serve as a volunteer army for the transfer of energy from the heart.
In the eyes of reporters who regularly report on the project, the "Secret" section had already become the potential of the next Lyndan.
According to the Department of Public Information, a friendly consultation between the Central American and Central American parties was held in the South Sea on Wednesday, 20 December, with the successful completion of the transfer of unmanned aircraft.

The sex machines are really excited, but we need to be careful.
A new technical development report has been published in the area of sex machines when you think it will not be more unusual in 2017.
Yes.
Now the sex machine is a big deal.
Recently, FRR issued a report, which looked forward to the development of the sex organs in the next five to ten years.
According to Professor of Technology and Human Wisdom at the University of Field University and the co-founder Noel? Shaki, we need to begin to take a serious interest in the evolution of the physical machines.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes of the machine, the shape of the hair and the type of the finger.
When Shaki published his new report, he said: "People laugh behind the back, but big companies have actually introduced a lot of sexual machines, and we will see more."
Modern lovebirds have developed into machines, they have ovarian skin, they are warm, and they are willing to use human intellectuals to develop human behavior.
The user can also "definite" their machines to satisfy their pleasure, from the eye color, the hair shape to the index type or color.
But it's even more disturbing that a lot of "personal" machines will make the "repairing wife" look much better.
Modern love has developed into a machine that has a nylon skin.
For example, RealBotix machines can come from a definition based on the characteristics of the user's sense of attractiveness, such as shame.
Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Company, can predetermine the character characteristics, including the low-fashioned "frequency Falala" and the "frequency of adventure".
"Roxxxy Gold's machine has the same personality as you, "True Company's website has the best chance of enjoying it.
So she loves what you love, what you hate.
She had a little compassion in those days, just like normal people!
She can breathe, she can talk, and she can't've sex."
The awakening of the sexual organs has brought a lot of trouble — not only replacing true human relations — but also the femininity of a pregnant woman, as well as the most disturbing indication of rape on the part of Pharaoh.
True Company compared Roxxxy to a man's shock on his website.
"Why can't a man have Roxxxy if a woman has a shock?"
However, these sexual organs are not a single thing, nor are they just a sexual instrument.
Their appearance and their growth are more and more direct to the darker part of our culture: from the perfect gender equality, to the sexuality of the ministry as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not have sex machines, and although the FRR notes that sex machines are becoming increasingly popular, they are still on the edge of a culture of consumption.
But things from the border may give us a glimpse of the process of our times.
Many people are not prejudiced and have no aggressiveness until the free market gives them a chance to do so.
These precise sexual organs are at a time when the rights of a global woman are threatened, and there is also a president who has been accusing women of sexual violence, which is not a coincidence.
The television drama "for women's story" is not a real picture, it's not a body with a bonded body, it's not the eyes that are buried in the eyes of the two, but it's a real idea.
The Republic of Chile is a jump, but it doesn't seem far now.
The goal behind these sexual organs is to create the most true human body that could be created by technology (even though it is a proportion of the physical star).
The creation of these machines wants them to have human touch and to imitate the real human movement.
But clearly, their "identity" doesn't represent real women.
They can't break up, they can't go out.
They did not seek assistance from agencies, nor did they follow the story, nor did they have any independence, nor did they have any possibility of breaking up the whole idea of slavery.
In other words, they're interesting slaves.
Or according to the 2017 tradition: for women.
In ancient times, a China-Hungary Force used the story of a life-threatening war to protect humanity in the long known cities of the world.

Let Mitt Romney be a regular shadow.
Political differences have led to two extreme divisions of American voters, and from a micro-view, they have destroyed American families and communities.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, U.S. newspapers are filled with comments on how to deal with the fear of members of the electoral class.
It's common to think that we're doing our best to break our "excessors."
A smaller comment is that Tranpe has the power to bring the family together.
I mentioned this because of my sister, who lives in Chicago, who lives in the left-hand corner, who has been staying with our family for a long time, and who wants to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that solidarity and mutual opposition could have a powerful effect.
As a result of working with Tranpe in the White House, she met all the people she knew, including all the political parties who had been at war for decades, now suddenly and strangely standing on the same front line.
It's a good thing if you're all in the dining table, but it's a shock to me that, from a broader perspective, it's going to pose a serious risk.
Although the left-hand side of the human being has been plagued by the trauma of Tarnup, he has been the presidential influence that has led us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trenmppu, we refer to the possibility of worrying, that some day his weird behavior might stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term perspective, which, as a general rule, "normalization" has been associated with right-wing parties, who had previously opposed the standards of the President, and now suddenly seemed to be a sign of rationality.
I have recently discovered that I have some strange memories of Mit?Romeni's craziness: the tax on the car, 14 per cent (but at least we know his tax declaration) that the crimes of these two movements seem to be relatively small compared to Trannon.
In the past decades, the next joint party candidate had only a reasonable need to achieve an unestimable improvement.
When my sister lives in the city, we take her to New York Park, which is the largest toy run by the Central Park Manager in New York, and if you don't need coffee, these three-pound tickets are your most cost-effective value in this city.

Too many traditional cities are disappointed: from the perspective of the high-walled buildings, the skyline has become too familiar to provide too much encouragement, and the reality of the city has not given rise to dreams.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, I found this Swiss little house not Switzerland, but it's a place on the theme bar "The Old Swiss Cottage" (Ye Old Swiss Cottage), which I don't remember yet, but near a crossway in north London.
However, the rotation of the central park remains an amazing experience for two 2-year-old children, an 11-year-old child, and two 40-year-old girls, each of whom had a fun.
If I could evaluate the rotation of the train, I'd be able to give it a good deal, but no one's asking.
But this week at a sales company, I was asked to review my transaction "test" to five stars before the credit card.
In the coffee shop in the corner of my street, it's also possible to choose 15% of the cost, which is for buying things on the table.
The effect of doing so is not only to reduce the rate of sexual transactions that should be the case but also to impose pressure on the service provider to add personal factors to situations that are not necessary.
The poor woman in this hundred store was smiling, and I was tired, and she was given five stars by credit card transactions.

Is breast-feeding, breast-feeding products and chocolate help to relieve infectious diseases (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like your system's dream.
A new study, however, shows that eating food containing meat proteins and milk products can help alleviate the symptoms of infectious diseases.
This disorder affects about 130,000 Americans and some 330,000 British people, leading to nausea and vomiting, regular or bleeding, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at Washington University generally recommend that patients avoid the introduction of foods and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, but researchers find that key protein acids in protein help to promote the growth of immune cells, which can enhance the endurance of the pathogens.
Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells will run patrols in the path and ensure that harmful microorganisms in the food do not penetrate the body.
Conformity between the cells causing the disease and the cells that promote tolerance and protect the body from harming vulnerable organizations of all kinds.
If the condition is too extreme for the infection, it may cause infectious diseases.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunization appeared in a small white mouse with special cells.
The phytosanitary needed to form a phytosanitary look.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of phytosanitary (Roys ’ phytosanitary, normal part of the microbiological group) and the development of healthy vertebrates.
The number of small white rats in the diet is increasing, and their immune cells are increasing.
He suggested that if humans use the same methods, the combination of urticaria and rich-coloured cirrhosis could create a more tolerant and less vulnerable veto environment.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganas (Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas) studied a potent immunosuppressant cell when she found a group of rats had such cells, but there was no other group of the same bacteria.
She suspects that this difference is related to the microorganisms of the small white mouse (usually living in the phytosanitary, virus and phytosanitary) group.
There are six species of phytosanitary groups in the small cell that have immunized cells, but there are no small white cells in the ovaries.
Small white rats feed in non-cellular environments, so they lack microorganisms, and cannot develop these immunization cells, and the presence of pathogens produces immunization cells.
In order to understand the impact of the immune system on the phytosanitary system, researchers have developed pathogens in the fluids and then transferred quantified phytosanitary fluids to unaccompanied urea cells separated from small white rats.
Immuno-cell development is becoming a patient cell.
When the active substance is purified from the liquid, it can be shown that the active component is an alternative product that is exposed to color acids, called ethyl-3-methane.
The number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent after the number of color acids in small white cells, but the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people, like rats, have the same cells that promote endurance, and most of us are in our stomachs.
Whether humans are able to develop cells that are the same as the microorganisms in the experiment, which are not yet known, they have found genetic defects related to color acids in patients with cirrhosis.
She said, "The development of these cells may be the result we want, because these cells can control the immune response that appears in the veins.
It can be said that the high level of color acid in the urea can lead to an increase in the number of the bacterium.
Jose Murino thinks Manon signed the "Scientific" Nemania Mattic.
On the third night of the week, after the first light of the fight against the attack, Némania Matitch, Murino identified a "scientific" member of the band.
Mattic came from Chelsea, signed at $4,000, and won the bridesmaids of Paul Bogba and Andreyas Perela in the final season of the European summit in Dublin before the King's death in Madrid.
However, during the pre-Brussels season in Asia, the situation was very poor, and only 45 minutes had been completed, and Murinio recognized the need for improvement before the start of the season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and the way of thinking -- he's thinking about football," said Murino.
"We'll help him prepare as soon as possible."
Murinio started his lead at the beginning of this season.
The independent report of this week, Murino still wants to introduce three signers again, but he insists that the club "work is great", and in his heart there are four first-class players, and the club has introduced three of them.
"The club introduced three of them, and I thank you very much. "He added.
"If the club could introduce all four players, I'd be happier, but they've made a lot of effort for me."
If China doesn't build this ship, will it fall?
With the publication of the construction plans of new protective vessels by the superpowers of the world in recent years, however, in the middle of the night, the concern of the superpowers was that Japan had identified two new protective vessels for procurement in the 2018 defence budget, which led to a substantial break in Japan's DEX guard plan, and then the United States of America had recently published the latest programme of the U.S. FF.G. Protection Plan, so what would happen to China's new protections?
With the latest 054A protected waters at the end of 2017, it is marked that the 054A protected vessel has built more than 29 roofs and has been approaching the total of the 053H protected vessels, and that the construction of the first 054A to this day of 2006 has been 12 years, even worldwide, with the construction of such a high level of capacity to use the protective vessel, except China, only the United States of America, which was built in the 7,80th century.
And why it is so simple to build so many 054A, which is useful and useful, and to supplement the many years-old army accounts.
054A has been awarded a higher sexual price and good fighting force for many years by the Chinese Navy, its 4,000-tonnes, with a total of 76 mm-powered, 32-pound-ray and 8-millitime systems that launch a total of anti-missiles, 83-squares and a vertical-9-meter, although the design of a ship was rather early in 2006, but it is still not too bad, and can reach the level in the world's protection zone.
However, this was a ship designed by the early 21st century, which was placed on the one side with its power system and electronic radar equipment, which had already been very different from that of the current world's major protective vessels, such as the same type of European protection vessels had been equipped with full power to move forward, with small multi-functional resistance to the Praeda, with large-scale helicopters and with the development of the new type.
So how should new protective vessels in China develop, which is directly linked to their future position and our strategic approach to the Chinese Navy?
The future of the Chinese Navy will be completely a blue sea, and the future will also be a journey to the oceans, with rapid deployment of areas of interest in China's Chechnya, demonstrating the presence of force and, if necessary, the ability to have a strong fight to ensure that China's coastal interests will not be damaged, so that new waves will appear to be growing and remote development.
Looking again at the situation in the future in the Chinese Navy order, the future Chinese Navy should be like the US Navy, and other major ships, except those required, will be formed as a team of pilots or as a two-way attackers, as necessary.
The role of the new protected vessels in the future fleets should be a position of counter-optimal and central space in the region, and in the fight against two armed groups, the role of the new protection fleets should be a team of defence vessels, so that, in accordance with such a need, new protection vessels must have strong anti-opportunity capacities and good medium-range space capabilities.
On the basis of the above-mentioned position, a great deal of imagination can be seen from the overall example of the future country's mother-in-law.
Firstly, there will be a large increase in the current 054A protective vessels, estimated to reach around 5000-6000 tonnes of new protective vessels; the engine system will use an integrated power drive system with a QC280 to improve the fuel cycle and the two oil engines, and the highest speed is expected to reach approximately 30 seconds; and the continuation of the aircraft should be significantly increased; with regard to the installation of 76-mm and 1130-pronged weapons, an additional 10-flamming system, a 32-48-48-inch re-launching and a total-8-ray system, which would then be fitted with an 8-16-mg large-in-powering system for the launch of new aircraft; and a new-power-powered aircraft would also be increased to a level of 10-powered aircraft, which would be able to be used in a range of three-scale systems; in a range of three-dimensional ranges.
The overall level of such a new type of protective vessel will reach a standard of circulation in the world, even if it is relatively small in comparison with the U.S. FFG.
The concept, of course, is that of the writer's idea of a new kind of protected vessel in the country, and how can we find a way to look at the water of the new protected vessel only when it comes to our common expectations?

China's family debt is closer to the United States than it's safer to buy houses?
In recent times, what recent changes have everyone been discussing the property policy, and are they going to be slowing down? A land policy for pluralization for the subject will not cause the price to decline?
However, when we are concerned about the price of property, the macroeconomic adjustment, the future developments of the real estate market, the "people's journal" have been rewritten, and the last time we specifically discussed the definition of "people's journal" comments on the sale of property control, and now the "people's journal" is a more serious issue than the purchase of housing, is it even if you buy a house and have a debt?
Today, we are talking about more serious issues than buying houses: loans.
First, the growing debt crisis in China
According to the data published in the "People's Day" publication on 17 January, commentaries were published on the award and loans of young people," and according to the data in the document, the National Institute for Finance and Development of the National Institute of China, the National Institute for Finance and Development, the National Institute for the Study of National Tables for Assets and Development, the third quarter of China's report, noted that the population-sector fluctuations continued to rise, from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, from 1.3 per cent in 2017 to 1.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2017.
The debt of the housing sector is greater in the economy of all entities, and the rate of growth is faster.
The relevant studies show that the family of China is headed for consumer loans in financial institutions, approximately 2/3 of its inhabitants, approximately 2 times of its operational loans.
Of these, 8 are long-term loans owned by housing loans, but the growth in short-term consumer loans is faster than in medium-term loans.
In addition, China's family debt rate has only been recorded by the family sector as a total of loans received from financial institutions, while China's families have a number of civil loans, including loans to close friends, and large-scale debt.
Such data show that some of the findings are not prohibited, according to statistics from the Finnish Financial Institute, that only 3 per cent of China's population in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but that there has been a rapid rise in population rates since 2008 and that there has been only one 6 per cent increase in the number of people living in the third quarter of 2017.
We have issued a cross-border 9-country survey by the Bank in May compared with one more data, which has been published by nearly a thousand visitors.
The visit to the report is aimed at young "Millions of the Millennium" in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
The report noted that 80,90 young people in China had a high rate of 70 per cent, leading to a second distance (46 per cent) and a double level of the United States index (35 per cent).
These data tell us a very likely problem, which is comparable to that of unscathed houses, the largest possible "grain cows" in China's present phase is no longer a debt.
Second, why is the housing debt crisis the most serious issue?
As our previous analysis has shown, although we have always said that China's premises are higher, but in comparison with other countries in the world, China's housing levels are really high, so it's not possible to buy high-cost houses with them, so I'm afraid you can borrow a lot of friends now?
We look at the world's real estate markets, and China's real estate markets have not yet experienced a major real estate crisis in addition to what we said earlier in the sea, but the origin of the global financial crisis in 2008 was the United States of America's real estate crisis.
The causes of the U.S. property crisis are attributable to two rooms: rent and rent.
At the time of the gold era in the United States, the real estate company sold the house to a very low-priority group of low-income people in the United States at the time, and when the US economy was well-off, the real estate market was also a welcome one, but it was not long before the US economy had stopped growth and led to a decline in the income of the buyers, resulting in a significant decrease in family consumption.
However, the current situation in the United States was a component of the United States family assets and property assets, and the low income group of the United States was almost all of the family assets, while most of the former 20 per cent of the high income groups were financial assets, which led to a higher debt of the poorest in the United States of America.
A serious fact is that these people were both houses that were bought in a better time of economic life, so the money paid was also calculated by their better income, and when the income came to a decline, the pressure of the housing was not reduced, not only because some of the loans had increased, so that the issue of the property of these American families was gradually becoming a crisis of property.
As a result, some people have been able to pay less rent, so the bank has begun to recover their property, and after the bank has recovered from the late-debt tenants, they will sell it at a very low price, resulting in a gradual decline in the price of the premises in the region, and this process has resulted in further declines in the price of the premises and, at a certain level, the increasing number of buyers have found that their house value is even lower than their own loans, resulting in more people stopping the loan, and more damage.
Thus, a huge evil cycle is formed:
"Economic imbalances -- income cuts -- some people still have no rent -- bank low-cost housing -- downsales -- more people stop resales -- banks also sell -- housing prices and downs..."
Moreover, the question is, since the price continues to decline, everyone ceases to lend the house to the bank and you are not obliged to pay the bank for the money you have received, so you still need to borrow the money, simply assume that you bought a set of $60 million at the time of the rent, and buy a set of $30 million at the time of the rent to this house, and then you no longer lend the house to the bank, and then you lose your rent of $600,000,000, and you have to pay back the money.
Thus, under such an evil cycle, the United States' economic decline has finally led to a financial crisis in the United States in 2008.
Thus, the level of family debt in China at the present stage reached 46.8 per cent of the highest level of the present rate of family debt is a very need for warnings, which is currently seen as being lower than the level of developed countries, but the root of the problem has begun, and since the beginning of last year, it has been a very early decision that if the family debt rate continues to rise, it will inevitably pose a huge risk, so as to prevent serious financial risks.
As a result, houses were used for housing rather than for housing, the country was more rapidly creating a multi-ethnic supply, multimodal safeguards, procurement and reorganization measures to further mitigate potential risks.
For our individual families, it is imperative that we give up the idea of leaving the premises for investment, of buying the house, and of preventing their families from falling into enormous burden, that only reasonable assessment of their income and liabilities is a healthy family's means of developing wealth.

According to the military records published in the journal "The Age, the last month's decision to transport a military army helicopter to South-West for the great honor of U.S. manufacturing, costing up to $24,000.
Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as the Marine Army War I) was an important demonstration of the project construction activities of the United States on July 17.
President Donnad Tramp, Vice-President Mike Jones and senior officials from all 50 countries visited production products.
The exhibit has helicopters manufactured in the state of San Diego, a train in Maine, a fire truck in Wisconsin and a train in Mississippi.
In accordance with the record of the First Air Force Air Force Air Force Helix (HMX-1) operating the helicopter, the Office of the White Army requested that the helicopter be present according to the daily order (FRAGO) only 36 hours before the helicopter was to take part in this "special" activity in the South Pole.
One day before the event, HMX-1 Commander HMX expressed in an e-mail sent to the Deputy Commander of the Upper Marine Army Army, "I just want to assure you that you know, because this event is highly important. "
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at approximately 7:00 a.m. on 17 July, at 3 p.m. and leave after 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on that night.
The information also indicates that no delay has been made from the White Paper, since travel time is limited by the need for the second group of organs.
The ex-computers were waiting for their lives at the helicopters during their activities, while security forces were waiting for their lives near the ground.
The records in the journal "Times" did not make it clear whether second group members were finally needed.
"Hachch Act" prohibits the use of government property for political purposes by federal employees.
According to the record, HMX-1 had asked whether this event had violated the Act.
The commander wrote, "One of the questions we ask is whether this was a violation of the Hachi Act, and was informed that there was no violation. "
"It sounds like you're locked up," the Deputy Commander replied.
The White House has defined this "United States" activity as official activities, so it is not subject to "Hacky Act".
But even official activities have political colors.
In the event, the President raised the question of the Senate at the time: medical reform and a great deal of pressure on the rule of law of the Government.
It's no new thing to use the Marine War One or Air Force One aircraft for political publicity.

In February, Tarnup was concerned at the slow pace of the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida, where he ended up in the background of his first election session, and his Twitter account filled with complaints about the former President's use of the president's campaign.
Lingse Walters, a White Paper journalist, said that "the White House was no longer motivated by the 'U.S. production' exhibition, which showed products from all 50 states, all of which were made by American workers. "
HMX-1 was regularly trained in flight training near Washington and South Poles, and trained to install the President of the United States precisely in the White House.
In the first part of July, Tranpe participated in the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 was held 58 times in the White House.
One official stated that this United States manufacturing activity had been calculated in the training requirements of this month's team.
The helicopter forces also flew 11 hours that day for "non-Presidential support."
The White Paper claims that tax collectors have not taken any other means of carrying out this activity.
Sikorsky stated that the company did not participate in the installation of South-West helicopters.
HMX-1 did not retain the budget record of the President's flight, so it was very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defence, according to the hourly cost of the financial year 2017, the Ministry of Defence would be able to repay the costs of VH-3D to $24,380 per hour of flight.
The military records recorded the time every time the aircraft flew from the base of the U.S. Marine Army Airport in the state of Virginia for 30 minutes.
The value of the helicopter is said to be lower than that cost.
Walters claims that the costs of taxable persons are highly misleading based on the cost of payment.
These estimates include staff costs, maintenance costs and many others, including unspent costs in annual allocations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the cost of reimbursement by the Ministry of Defence does not include staff costs, but does include oil costs, maintenance costs and contract costs.
At the time, the former White House journalist Sean Spike used the helicopter to defend this activity,
"The idea is to show the United States in this week,
And I know that Sikorsky and Conching are proud of this, and they have all contributed to our country's security, and I guess there are thousands and hundreds of people who will rely on it.
And I feel like most Americans, we all feel proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of a number of Americans who do not resort to violence.
So it's obvious that there's no time for this."
We don't know if Trenmp is interacting with the helicopter when visiting the South Pole in the event, but he actually sat on the train seat.
In the White House, Trannon made a speech to the representative of Sikorsky, who took his own company plane with the media.
He said, "I know Sikersky. I have three. "
