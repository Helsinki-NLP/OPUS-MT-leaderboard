White pedone to f3, black pedone to e6, white pedone to g4, black woman to h4 - yellow squat! This is clearly indicated in sacchitic circles like "schoco matto".
White: Tower in a1, pedona in b6, king in c8. Black: pedoni in a7 and b7, king in a8, alpha in b8. The White puts the opponent in the zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after the Black has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move his alpha into any other score on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes progress his pedona from b6 to b7 and gives a sharp shot. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pedon in a7, with the same result.
