He built a baricad on the road.
She was very nice to me.
Who's the better?

Greetings are always sad.
Though he also lives in the United States, Thomas does not learn to speak English.
Why are you feeling that way?
What food do you have?
It's not bad.
No, he's not my new kid.
You can't just leave.

A lot of people noticed that she was not at the party.
I'd go out on a dollar.
Leave me alone!

I'm asking you to drive carefully.
Give me the gift!
There was peace all over the world.
That doesn't mean I'm gonna stop doing this.
My father bought me a new bike.
Tomas did not know whether to return to the battle or to the right.

That's a great idea.
We'll all die sooner or later.
Why is your casino so big?
You're engineers.
Are you sure?
Do you know where he lives?
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
He left an hour ago.
You have to take care of yourself.
Don't forget us.
I'm a good student of Germans.
That ship is traveling to Finland.
My mom doesn't know him at all.
They're alive?
It's for the roof.
Let me talk to her.
Could I have another cup of tea?
I don't remember another name.
It's impossible for Vilko to get involved.
Where did you find their cat?
I want to see this movie.
This is a big step forward.
Say what you want.
We're leaving Boston.
Tom could not help but sense that something was going on right away.
I don't have to agree with anything I say.
I know from experience; playing football base is a bad idea. You can easily stay with broken legs.
It's just a shock.
People's shock on the streets.
You're as tall as I am.
I'm listening to music.
Tom raised his sons without any help.
That's what the tank went through.

I'm going to the store.
This water doesn't smell good.
Everything's done in handcuffs.
You're the speed of our mission.
Ken and his brother are very similar.
You want guitars.
Look what that kid's doing!
I'm sorry.
It's not my job.
I came later than usual.
She's got one cat.
It has a special way of getting the data.

But no.
If I wanted to wake you up, I'd tell you what I dreamt a few weeks ago.
God helps those who help themselves.

We were all shocked.
Don't worry, I promise I'll do what you ask.

I want to write a book.
I don't understand how he can talk to you in your mouth.
People don't live forever.
I love dogs.
Come on, help me.
I ended up enjoying my friend.
Lyja.
Jenna is more attractive than Sizan.
No one knows if he loves her or not.

I'm going to buy a gift.
That girl is Mary.
His daughter has a very beautiful name.
You don't have to help me.
I ran to my mother.
I'm very early.
Their daughter is very beautiful.

My father was never abroad.
Today he read a very long book.
What are you talking about?

Talking on the radio is not easy.
Are you ready to go?
They stood up and listened to the words.
My aunt is the manager of the company.
The year's coming!
You don't understand.
This is a good reason to get to know each other.
How do we find Tom?
Herous eventually succeeded a good scientist.
The ship showed up in the horizon.
Take it easy, Tommy.
Isn't that right?
In the case of fire, press the glass and press the red button.
Keep your eyes marked until I tell you to notice them.
We'll be ready.
One of the dogs is alive.
This fish doesn't smell good.
Most dogs are alive.
This disabled person is usually used only for third parties.
My dad's car is new.
Watch out, watch out, march!
The green leaves become red and yellow.
I have to get to that train.
I always wanted a dog.
We saw her entering the park.
Tell me about your wife.
I'd like to be a little higher.
The speed of the light is much higher than the speed of the sound.
I've never had a girl.
Listen to me while I speak.
What do you want to do?
Someone told me you were blind.
I'm going to make it up to you to share.
The masks you gave me are very good.
It's a good idea to get to know each other.

It's great to be here.
Japan imports various raw materials from abroad.
This man doesn't want to do anything.
You should respect your teachers.

Tom could not forgive Mary for killing his parents.
The more you have, the more you want.
Europe is not a country.
Hello, is anyone there?
Tom's wife left him in 2013.
His heart is constricted.
This man is my friend.
Do you remember what she said?
Did Marika write you a letter in Finnish?
He mentioned your name.
She looks like my sister.
Never compare your wife to another woman.
The sympathies have already come out of the bed.
You see me working.
I don't think he'll ever come back.
My children were taken from me.
You like Tom.

I am very grateful for what I said.
You can't get out of here.
The doctor came right away.
Later.
The car already has one small casino.
Isn't that right?
I forgot to talk to him today.
Here's my door.
I don't want to hurt you.
There's always a fever.
I'm just looking at it, so I'm not naked.
I don't have your address.
Are you all right?
Reading is my lesson.
I saw the moon above the horizon.
He should've done that before.
That's impossible.
No matter what you say, no one likes you.
He said I'm not sleeping enough.
The language is never foreign.
Who's this house?
To fear means to die a thousand times, that is worse than death.
Carrot milk is more expensive than soya milk.
Where are you staying?
Mother's asleep.
That doesn't mean I'm gonna stop doing this.
What do you think she's doing now?
Thomas doesn't know if Mary's standing with us or not.
Am I cleaning up my time?
It's too hot.
Come on!
Tomui's got it.
For the first time, I see the sun's clock.
Who's his house?
I'm hoping for your help.
I'm not about your language.
I'll go to Boston for the holidays.
Death is intelligent and has a good sense of humor.
I especially like this scene.
I don't want to wait so long.

Are there survivors?
Is there a reason for this?
How does your car look?
It's hot today.
This woman's English number.
The rest of us are here.
Is this car too small?
What's the size of your shoes?
He's beautiful as a god!
The medium is green.
Tomas did not know whether to return to the battle or to the right.
Japan is a brave nation.
They're incredible.

Trust those who seek the truth, save those who find it.

Where are you now?
You're a great teacher!

Try again.
I'm an Albanian because I didn't break up.
Steps.
Hello, world!
He'd like to know if the game was in shock.
You only understand now?
I was told to go home.
These bottles are too salty.
I was born in Russia.
I've been looking for everything, but I can't find my money.
Trikapies don't have four camps.
I wouldn't sell it for anything.
I didn't believe anyone would be home.
I wouldn't be happy today.
She's starting.
At the time of the conversation, I was busy.
Mergaitė plays the flute.
I learn to love.
Let's get all the cards!
The door was down automatically.
Do I have to stay in the hospital?
I don't know where to look.

The horses are animals.
The bear is lifeless.
He can read the mind.
I never believed it in such a place.

As far as I know, he won't.
What a lovely hair.
Or it's no longer necessary.

Move tight.
Can I help you with this stuff somewhere else?

Some people eat them with their hands.
It's never a training.
The water's close to the sun.
The President died unexpectedly.
It's a trap.
I don't like the city where he lives.

This tree grows near her house.
Don't talk in the library.
How you doing, panel?
I'd go out on a dollar.
We're never alive.

There's just no fair answers.

They've missed a great deal.
Fight for your right.
He's always talking to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I've had one of these, and I've got a lot of fun.
Thomas did not think that he needed a personal funeral.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have questions about this teaching?
We saw how she got into the park.
I don't think we should be busy.
You didn't look like you wanted that book.
I've got a red twin.
It's low and heavy.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was slow.
He's smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
Today's the worst time.
I didn't want this to happen.

Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Take the time to clean up and get back to work.
The more you do, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is that your car?
I can't believe you're still a Alkan.
The desire to be happy is quite normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's ID?
Last night, my hand hurt.
If I had been rich, I'd have given you some money.
I don't have a computer.
My father doesn't have much fruit.
Can you give me a break?
She gave me a ride and made me a good night's sleep.
My friend's here.
Where's life now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Thomas doesn't drink coffee, but he drinks cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'll stay here a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a bad thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's writing.
We'll take a look at the pharaoh.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.

This car was manufactured in Japan.
Is that your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make his photobot!
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Thomas's never gonna let you down.
I was in Canada then.
I made this food myself.
Get the fuck out of here.
Someone wrote his name on the wall.
The only thing that can touch the wrong side of us is the circle.
They don't have sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Tom wants him to stay tonight and he won't be there again.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mom.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You don't have to spit in that velvet.
When will the snow fall?
He thinks I'm very tired.
I don't think she needs to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or before us.
Please, help me!
Thomas knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's out of the dog.
He went to the store, but he stopped at her house.
Snow is moving fast.
We're here.
Of course I should read this book.
At present, Thomas is not in prison.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship is moving along the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who remain.
I can't work when you're up there.
Mary had hair problems.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did she buy herself?
The child worked all night.
Did you kill me?
She witnessed before him.
My father's growing rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I went through the window.
The meat's not ready yet.
Give me some credit cards.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Sutemo, can we turn the light on?
He's no longer a doctor.
That was the first time I saw the museums.
We're wasting our time.
I think Tom wants to stay.
What a nice family.
Are you still Florida?
You didn't have to eat those bad fish.
It's the last day of the morning.
We looked at the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anyone here.
Our teams lacked mobility.
The cat's gone through the street.
Tena's a picture.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
I beg your pardon.
He was busy.
I'm pregnant.
I saw him.
I'm paying Lozban.
"Good morning," said Tom in a hurry.
I'm hurting my arm.
He needs a cup of coffee.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.

You have to adjust your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.

They work eight hours a day.
I'm hungry and I'm good.
I do this every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I'll forget everything I said.
Where'd you get all those characters?
I'm in the middle of the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly recorded our names.
Our son died in the war.
He is not satisfied with the result.
Obviously you're wrong.
I can't tell you what's going to happen first.
I don't want to talk to you because you've broken my heart.
Don't believe him.
We'll go all the way to

Let's go for a drink.
The wings are hidden in the south.
This food is very expensive.
I don't know.
I'm sick.
It's okay, but I'm tired for a while.
That's a great idea.
He's very proud of his fate.
It'll be enough for us.
I wouldn't.
The woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?

I want to be a linguist.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry about what I did.
She's a nurse.
I learned to ride a bicycle when I was six.
He took off his coat of mail.
Let me do that.
I like the dance.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and enter the light air.
Have you ever promised to say something?
I'm a dog.
Did you see my mother?
I know his name.
Thomas doesn't want to live like that.
Did you agree with what she's doing?
He came here before he finished school.
You know their address?
What can you do?
He looked down on his prairie boots.
His cat was lying on my bed, and he didn't want to break it.
There are several nice hotels in the city.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to teach today.
We're all different.
You don't know how strong I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
Today I feel a little weak.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like listening.
Be careful, okay?
I'm buying a camera for $30.
That's great.
It's not a method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
There's a lot of tunnels down here.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I've been kicked out of my pockets.
He's able to look after people.
Boba was in bed at the time.
My brother is two years older than I am, but he is three inches lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Don't you see my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Tom's going to die fast.
I'm ready to go to bed later.
I've accepted it before.
Look at that house with a red bed.
My butt's on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're cricket players.
These clothes are yours.
Don't worry about it.
Do you know you're stronger than I am?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you go with us?
I don't care.
Tom could not find a reason for his need to return home early.
Put your hands up.
He didn't sell the house.
Nobody's ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't feel like we're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand what we want.
Tom's still a cat.
Go and open the door.
I told you I'd see each other later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs more than she needs.
- Oh, my God! - Oh, my God!
Tom, I'm back.
Would you like to meet me?
That's not a mistake.
The airport is on the way from the city center.
You can turn off the radio now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You're a very loving man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very kind man.
I was in Boston a few times.
You're a very nice man.
