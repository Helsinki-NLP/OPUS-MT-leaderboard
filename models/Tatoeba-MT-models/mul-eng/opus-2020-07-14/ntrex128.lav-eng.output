All members of the Assembly (AM) stress the possibility of "been covered as bright"
The members of the Assembly have been concerned about the proposal to change their name to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of Parliament).
Its purpose is to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AM in all political spheres are concerned that it can make them an object of shock.
One of the Leiborist Party's AM explained that their groups are worried about "the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Velas: In English, "twp" means "single", but "pwp" means "kaki".
Party Plaid AM indicated that none of the group "was satisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Allied Conservative Party acknowledges that his group is ready to consider a change of name, but adds that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", which means "record".
In this context, it should be noted that the wild boar "w" is spoken similar to the English dialect "w".
The assembly commission, which is currently developing to change the name of the draft legislation, was informed: "The final decision on which terms will be used to designate the members of the assembly is, of course, to be taken by the members of the same assembly."
The 2017 Act of the Government of Wales granted the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposal, which received extensive support for the change in the name of the Assembly to the Velsa Parliament.
On behalf of the AM, the Commission gave the advantage to the Welsh Parliament member (WMP), but the MWP received the largest support in the public consultation.
Of course, the AM offers alternative options, but the struggle for agreement can lead to a headache for the Assembly's troops, Elin Jones (Elin Jones), who is expected to submit a bill on change in the next few weeks.
The draft legislative amendments will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including laws on the structure of the AM Disability and Committees System.
The AM final vote on how they will be called will take place when the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on change in national name
The vote will be taken on Sunday whether their national name will be changed to "The Republic of Montenegro".
The people's vote was organized to resolve long-term disputes with neighboring Greece, which has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of the northern neighbour has an impact on claims on its territory and has already been opposed several times to Macedonia's request to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov (Gorge Ivanov), one of the lobbyists for a change of name, announced that he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoranu Zajev (Zoran Zaev), argue that the change of name is simply a matter to be taken into account in order to establish the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's call to the gods to fight for the Church of Harlem for the existence of.
"As is the history of the old people I have talked to," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one here today, no more."
He realizes that breaking the bar is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Several are no longer covered in the living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money he receives by selling property will end faster than the leader, "and sooner or later they will be back at the start".
For God, he adds, it is possible to replace the homes of many people with the properties of a dwelling in which people who do not help the remaining shrines will die.
"Most of the people who will buy the property of these buildings will be white," he explained, "and until that day, when these gods will be destroyed at all times, for little is believed that most of the people who will enter these houses' properties will become members of these threats."
Both gods formed a white friend, even before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolis (Metropolis) community in 1870, and the St.
The early white methodists ’ friendship of building was shattered in the 30th century.
The building was surrounded by a close friend who had prayed to God.
S. Márti's God-fearing black friend took his blessing during John Howard Johnson (John Howard Johnson). In 125th Street, in the main shopping area of Harlem, he led a small shopkeeper who had refused to take up work or to give them a promotion.
In 1939, Ugunsgrey was badly damaged by the building, but since Father Johnson’s friends planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call.
His glory was David Johnson (David Johnson), his father's son, and his successor to St. Martin's friend, the famously called the game "by the name of the poor man".
The expert who played this game in July used the other words: "cultural charity" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from Michigan University added that it was the first known game in the world that was played by the black-and-white musician Dionisio A. Linds (Dionisio A. Lind) who spent 18 years in the largest known games in the Rivershad church.
Mr. Merriweather reported that St. Martin’s friend did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martha’s god reflected the relationship between a number of architects and builders, some of whom were at work in time, while others were at the episcopal church diocese.
In July, the Council of Friends, which forms temporary leaders, referred in writing to the diocese with fears that the diocese would "supply to costs" to the Council, although the Council had not been involved in the settlement of the architects and builders sent to the diocese.
Some of my friends complained about the lack of transparency in the activities of the diocese.
Haizivs vaccinated 13-year-old half-year-old in a fishing area
The 13-year-old son who was killed by the bears was attacked by Hayiv on Saturday in California and attacked him. It was the first day of the Omar season, the news service.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., shortly after Beacon's Beach, in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel (Chad Hammel) informed KSWB-TV Sandjugo that he and his friends had been down about half an hour in the morning when he heard that the child was calling for help, and then the group rushed to him to help the child get out of the water.
Hammels explained that at the beginning he had thought that it was just a feeling of nude omora, but then he'd found out that the son was crying "I'm telling you!
I'm sorry!"
All her key bones were uncovered," Hammels told, who immediately noticed it when he reached his son.
"I'm crying to all the water, "There's a noise in the water!" Hammels added.
The air carrier was sent to the Children’s Hospital in Reidia (Rady), Sandjego, where his condition was recognized as critical.
The infected species is not known.
The rescuer's captain, Larry Giles, informed the media that a few weeks earlier in this area had been infected, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jäils adds that the upurim was traumatized by the upper part of the rupture.
For a period of 48 hours, amates for investigation and security purposes closed access to the beaches from Pontobiča (Ponto Beach) in Casablad, to the city of Svami (Swami's) Enzinitas (Encinitas).
Jails indicated that more than 135 species are present in this area, but most are not considered to be dangerous humans.
Sanisbury's plan to enter the United Kingdom beauty market
"Sainsbury's" gives the attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with a universally rich style shopping product for rich rows and trained sellers.
As part of the substantial contribution of the United Kingdom to the large beauty market, which continues to grow, although fashion and home-oriented items will decrease, in 11 business countries, the prices of more beautiful products will be tested and, if all of them are successful, the next year will be more of that kind.
In the mining sector, funds are invested when large companies are looking for opportunities to use bottles that were previously open to televisions, microwaves and home products.
"Sainsbury's" announced that they would double their offers in the area of beauty capture up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more locations with marked zones, like "Boots" in business.
The majority of the products will be attractive to the fishermen, which is more often demanded by the newest buyers in years.
In addition, the wholesaler "Fragrance Shop" will try the concession in two "Sainsbury's" shops, which were first opened in the previous week in Croydon, London, but the second will be opened in Seliou (Sellily Oak) Birmingge, later this year.
Buying on the Internet and switching to small purchases of food every day in local businesses means that large companies need to invest more in order to convince people to visit them.
"Sainsbury's" Executive Director Mike Koups (Mike Cupe) said that the trade places of goods will become even more similar to the universals, because the business chain is trying to fight the rest of the companies "Aldi" and "Lidl", offering a larger range of services, but without food.
"Sainsbury's" has established the trading sites of "Argos" in several hundred shops and has opened several "Habits" since the purchase of two chains two years ago, which, as is claimed, has improved the sales stops and made the most effective purchase.
The previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical sections ended with the result.
"Sainsbury's" joint venture with "Boots" was tried in early 2000, but the Union won after the conflict, how to share income from the wholesale industry.
The new strategy will be developed after Saninsbury's sold its 281 large pharmaceutical business to the owner of the chain, Celesio, Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million coins.
In accordance with this plan, the "Lloyds" task will be to supplement a range of wide exclusive skin collection products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vichy", in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hiks (Paul Mills-Hicks), "Sainsbury's" Commercial Director, said: "To improve the consumer's thinking environment, we have transformed our beauty products into the look and the impact they create.
We have also invested funds in particularly trained colleagues who will always be ready to make recommendations.
The range of our brands is designed to meet all the needs, but the attractive environment to the easy location means that we are now focused on the path to beauty, the goal that leads to the latest introductions of purchase."
Peter John's "noma's full" after Holly Viloubia withdraws from 11 million competitions
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "has changed his nose" after the TV director Holly Willoughby declined from 11 million marks with his lifestyle mark to pay attention to his new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Viloubia has no time to give their home price and accessories brand "Truly".
After the business was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand "Goop".
"This Morning" was used by the age of 37 to announce her prom.
Hollija Viloubia has been inspired by the star "Dragons Den" by Peter Jones in the mind, because he recently emerged from his successful lifestyle brand business — to focus all his attention on his new long-term contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Information sources claim that Johns was "innovationful" when a TV gold girl broke up during a meeting in his business residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts, which are worth up to 1.5 million dollars, meant that she no longer had the time to give her home price and accessories mark "Truly".
The company was compared to Guineat Platrova's sign "Goop", and, according to the house, it will twice increase the wealth of Viloubia, which, as a lesson, achieves an 11 million mark.
When Viloubia (37) used Instagram to announce that the "Truly" hit, Johns would move from Britain to one of his own free houses.
As a source of information: "Truly" was the main focus of Holly's priorities.
It was to be his long - term future that would have been entrusted to him in the next decade.
Her decision to release all the missing persons involved was a violation of her decision.
No one could tell what happened the other day: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlova is placed for the full sale of ready goods."
Experts believe that "This Morning" managers, which is one of the most financially profitable stars, can spend millions of money on the company, as a large number of funds have been invested in various products — from incense and candles, to clothing and goods at home, and will also stop them from being placed on the market.
And this can mean the long-term end of friendship.
The three children’s mother, Viloubia, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained close relations with Jonas and his wife, Tara Capp.
Viloubia "Truly" was established with Kepu in 2016, and 52-year-old Johns joined as President in March.
Both are held together on holidays, and Johnsam has 40% of the shares in the company of Boldvina TV producers.
Viloubia has to become a brand M&S messenger and is replaced by Entu Mcpartlin (Ant McPartlin) as the ITV "I'm A Celebility".
John's close source said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business business."
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism received from the news companies about a comment that some might recognize as "the President not sufficient", and that he was so positive about the North Korean leadership.
Why is the President so much to refuse?
Tramps said in his famous "known dictator" voice.
"I won't give up!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again once again after Tramps recognized his first visit to Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after June's summit in Singapore, one of the major North Korean diplomats Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the world leaders in the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "response" response" to the initial challenges in North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining justice.
Tramps in his speech were much more optimistic.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were ready to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these great relationships."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kimu have resulted in positive results — the cessation of race testing, the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"There's just a President's impression, but instead of being out there 10,000 people trying to get into this hard-lived territory, we have 200, wait, here," Tramps said, pointing forward directly to him.
Cunamis and earthquake in Indonesia determine the island by killing hundreds of people
For example, after the Lomboka earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombo has been displaced, the situation of the national disaster has not been explained, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Because in many cases they have very clearly thanked them for not asking for international assistance, so it is a known problem," said the young lady of Sumbunga (Sumbunga).
Although "Save Children" collects groups to move to Palu, it is still not clear whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that the Indonesian officials appreciated the situation of Palu to see if the international agency could make its contribution.
In view of the fact that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely vulnerable to natural disasters.
Although the Aceh (Aceh) has been established in the event of an accident, it is not uncommon for others to do so.
Most likely, the people were also affected by the fact that Palu did not respond to the warnings about tsunamis, even though the warning was in force.
Even the best time to move between many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters add to the burden of logistics.
The ship’s clinic, which had been in Lombo to treat earthquakes, is now going to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new station.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Vidodo) of Indonesia has made improvements to the infrastructure that has failed to make its selection the central point of the campaign, and he has allocated large amounts to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has led to Mr. Joko's administration and is expected to be re-elected in the next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to deal with a long-term problem that has led to a division in Indonesia where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were killed in their homes as Christians and Muslims fought on the streets, using swords, clubs and clubs, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniels Starridges with a hope to restore balance in the game against Chelsea
Daniel's Starridge (Daniel Sturridge) saved Liverpool from the loss of Chelsea in a pre-mier, finding words in the 89th of a Saturday game at Stemford Bridge in London.
Starridge received a game from Jerdana Šakiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), about 25 metres (30 yards) from the gates of Chelsea when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved a bomb a little by the edge of his body and then pushed the bomb next to the floor towards the station.
In this attempt, a bomb flew over the field, reaching the top of the network for good.
At the end of the bombing, Kepa Arizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) crossed the line and entered the network.
"I've just tried to get its position to be on the bomb, and players like Shak (Shaq) always play as far ahead as possible, so I'll just try to get myself as much time as possible," Starridge explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen Kante (Kante) approaching, shooting a bomb, and, many don't think, power."
"Chelsea" was in charge of 1:0 after 25 minutes of winning the title of the White Star, Eden Azards (Eden Hazard).
The Blues shooter played the bomb back to Mateo Kovača (Mateo Kovacic) before heading toward the middle of the village and at the maximum speed of the town of Liverpool.
Kovačic quickly played and received a bomb back in the middle of the village.
Then he made a beautiful border between the players by allowing Azardam to enter the area.
Azards survived the fast defense and finished the combination with a cross-sectional leg carrying the next pillar on the network, along with the Liverpool River, by Elison Becker (Alisson Becker).

The number of Indonesian tsunamis reaching 832 people
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832 people, and the state disaster agency reported on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been exposed to the roofs of the building after 7.5 magnitudes of large earthquakes that visited the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) high, informing the agency’s representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho).
A city of over 380,000 inhabitants covered the ruins of broken buildings.
Police suspected that women had been arrested by 32 - year - old men
The survey of splenic cancer was initiated following the discovery of a female body in Birkenhead (Birkenhead), Merseyside.
The 44 - year - old bull was found in the Grayson Mews street, where a 32 - year - old man was thought to have been arrested.
The police have called on people in this family who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brians O'Hagan (Brian O'Hagan) informed: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was around John's street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite every, especially the cab drivers, who may have set something on their car video recorders' materials, to contact us, as they may have important information for our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the local residents of Birkenheda, and she was found in her own property.
On this afternoon, friends who think that they know a woman have gone to a crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and as the police informed, they are working on the information of the relatives of the nearest Upura.
The cab driver who lives in Greisonmjūz tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or remove it.
He could not say a word when he learned what had happened.
The people are informed that the hours of the journey will allow them to return.
He was aware of how a policeman told a man that all the suspicion was held as a crime scene.
In the crime scene, women appeared in the ass.
She continues, "That's so weird!"
On two afternoons, there were two police cars inside, and another one was located right outside.
A number of police were stationed inside the cordon and controlled a multi-living house.

Cromvela's status in Parliament becomes the latest "recording of history" scandal
The rejection of it would be justified in light of the similar activities of the Taliban, which resulted in the many memories of England's culture and religion of its fanatical Puritans.
However, Mr Crick described the proposal by Cromvela of Krika (Crick) as "study" and "a attempt to re-write stories".
John Goldsmiths (John Goldsmith), President of the Cromvela Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of the status, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromvela would also become a figure outside the city of Westminster.
Cromvel himself did not choose to do it, nor did he perform the burning of candles during the war of the British citizens.
It is possible that the unrighteous Cromvel will be defeated by his predecessor, who lived centuries ago because of the actions of Thomas.
Sera Viljama Hemo Sorneikrofta (Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft) is an image of Cromvela in the 19th century, and is part of the history of the person who, as many think, still deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith (Goldsmith) reported on Sunday Telegraph: "Many of the Cromves, perhaps, were more than today at the end of the 19th century, considered Parliament's defense against external pressure, of course, was a monarchy.
The next historical discussion on whether it really is a fully developed theme image.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century marked the future development of our nation, and Cromvel is a well-known personality that represents one of the long-term diversity.
What she has achieved, being a Lord's Protector, is worth the excitement and mention."
Cúka-slepkava till death of farmers buried in China
According to the information available on the local media, in the pig market in southern China, a farmer was attacked and killed.
The man — mentioned only by his name Yuñs (Yuan) — was found dead with a cross - arterial artery, all in one blood on the pig market in the province of Lupanshu in Guidžo (Guizhou), reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The chicken is ready to inject vaccines on May 30, 2005 in pigs in the province of Xining in China, China, China, China, China, China.
It is reported that he and his brother had left the nearby Yuņnā province on the third day to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother discovered a dead man and discovered that the door of the nearby dog was open.
He told me that there was a big dog father with blood on his mouth in the dog’s dog.
According to the information provided by the Court of Justice, a medical investigation confirmed that the heavy web site (~249 kg) had drowned the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and broken," said the brother — she was the only one mentioned by her name Vu (Wu), a copy of the article "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how he entered the market on Thursday about 4.40 p.m. to wash his teeth.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Jonah did not belong to him nor to his brother.
The market manager informed "Evening News" that the website was closed to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to information, Yuan’s family and market management will discuss compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, they are known for other dog attacks.
In 2016 the dog attacked the woman and the men at her farm in Masačussets, resulting in a man's being hit by critical attacks.
More than 10 years ago, 650 pigs (~295 kg) had a heavy dog in Velsa had farmed on the tractor until the animal had stopped his wife.
After a farmer in Oregon in 2012, his dog, a farmer in Manitoba, "CBC News", explained that dogs are usually not aggressive, but blood can act as a "gun gun".
"It's just rolling.
They like to smoke, they're very scientific... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orcana Rosa's conclusion in the U.S. Southern
As predicted, Orcene Rosa, walking through the coolest waters to the north coast of Mexico, will weaken.
However, in the near future, Rosa will bring floods caused by gas in the north of Mexico and in the southern United States.
Friday afternoon (in North America’s time) Rosa’s wind bridge reached 143 km/h (85 winter hours) corresponding to category 1, and its point was 620 km (385 winter) south of Punta Eiženia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
As long as over the Pacific, the low pressure is formed, moving toward the east, towards the east coast of the United States. Roza with tropical wind power near the Lejascalfornia (Baja California) side, it begins to take a deep mass from the troupe side to the north toward the U.S. southern.
In the first part of the morning, Mexico will bring up to 10 hills (~25.4 cm).
Then the tropical dream, in cooperation with the nearby low-pressure area, will set up a large, powerful gas zone in South America in the near future.
1–4 columns (~2,6–10,2 cm) will cause dangerous sudden floods, double currents and possibly earthquakes in Germany.
The depth of the deep from the troupe will cause greenhouse gases, which will reach 2-3 columns per hour (~5,1 to 7.6 cm), particularly in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-east, especially in the most part of Arizona, cases are expected to reach up to 24 hills (~5,2–10,1 cm).
A rapid deterioration of the situation is possible as a result of the depletion of tropical gases.
It is very unlikely that we will be exposed to toxic chemicals because of the threat of tropical gas.
Strong cases may turn canons into fast eggs, but bad ones will bring local brothers and sisters into the wind.
The pressure of the lower pressure is moving towards bringing the local forces to the south of California.
It is possible that the gas can be passed over half of the column (~1.3 cm) together and can cause small double flow and slide paths.
It will be the first gas in the region in the dark season.
A few isolated tropical greenhouse gases will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early morning before taking over the wider territory after Monday and early Tuesday.
Strong cases will be distributed in the fourth district (DR Colorado, DA Yuta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and for all three days.
In October there are potential intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic temperature falls, but the trophies are still quite hot.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature in a small distance.
This is an example of a dramatic difference in temperature on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between temperature in Kansas City, Mauritius, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demonin (Des Moines), Aio, is almost 20 degrees.
In the next days, we will try to create and emit a long summer heat.
It is expected that in most of the Central and Eastern parts of the United States, the beginning of October will be hot, reaching 80 degrees and more degrees (by Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celssia) in large areas from the south-east to the north-east.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees (by Farenheita; ~27 degrees by Celsius) on the second day, which would exceed about 10 degrees average.
Our long-term forecasts show that in the first half of October, temperatures in the east of the United States will reach an average.
More than 20 million people attended a hearing in the case of Britta Kaveno
More than 20 million people were watching television channels on Thursday with caution, as the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno (Brett Kavanaugh) and Christine Blasey Ford (Christian Blasey Ford), who accused Kaveno of sexual abuses, which, as a woman claims, took place in the 1980s.
As long as political differences continued, the railway companies were stopped by regular transmission to report on the latest Fridays: the agreement concluded by Senator Jeff Fleika (Jeff Flake) that the FBI would investigate the charges.
Forda informed the Senate's Committee of Justice that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had buried her dream and was trying to catch up with the middle school ball.
Kaveno frankly testified that he was absolutely convinced that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen's report, the total number of people was 20.4 million.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the interest of the average viewers.
Data on other broadcasting organisations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated them, were not available immediately.
And "Nielsen" usually presents problems, including people who are in office.
In order to obtain a better representation, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of the closing games or the number of the "Oskar" ceremony observers.
Fox News Channel, which the commentators have willingly supported Kaveno's appointment, was the largest number of viewers, average 5.69 million in all day listening, informed Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2,52 million, reported "Nielsen".
Interests remained high after hearing.
Fleek was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
Following the announcement by the Republican team that he had voted for Kaveno, the senator noted CNN and CBS's camera on Friday morning, when he, having taken the consensual call from the protesters, tried to proceed with a lift to the hearing of the Legal Committee.
Right away, CNN stood for several minutes with his eyes closed like a blanket.
"I'll stand here right in front of you," said one woman.
"You think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have the power, while so many women are powerless."
Fleek explained that his team had made a statement, and he was informed before the elevator door closed, that he still had something to say during the committee's hearing.
The cable networks and the broadcasting organisations were exposed directly several hours later when the Committee of Justice was preparing to vote on the opening of Kaveno to vote in the Senate.
However, Fleeks claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would consider the allegations made against the candidates, which had been asked by the minority of democracy.
Fly partly confirmed the negotiations with his fellow democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consultation with the Council and several other senators, Fleeks made his decision.
The choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not vote for Kaveno's approval without an investigation.
President Tramps has committed the FBI to investigate the charges raised by Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja accused the political games of Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa Meja interviewed people who criticized her plan to get out of the European Union, accused "political games" of the future of Britain and national interests.
British Prime Minister Terêza Meja is attending the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, still close to the interview with his first paper, Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson continues to attack his Brexit Plan on the Future of Britain with regard to the European Union, its so-called Chequers Plan, stressing that the proposal to use the UK and the EU is "completely absurd".
Take Simsa out: the police have arrested Diteon Simpson, who was there to suspect the LSU player's fraud
The police have arrested suspected of killing Veida Sims (Wayde Sims), a 20-year-old LSU basketballist.
The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson (Dytheon Simpson) was arrested and arrested as accused of a second degree of fraud, informing the Baton Rouge police officer.
The amateurs are dressed in a glass video showing Simsa's encounter with Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the wedding.
The CBS girl company WAFB reports that the police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After Simpson's understanding, the police informed him that he was aware of Veda's arrest.
As reported by a lawyer, he was granted $350,000 in high security money.
The team of medical experts from East Baton Rouge Parish, East Baton Rouge, is waiting for a temporary closure on Friday, stating that death caused this headache.
The Department thanked the operational group for the search of police refugees in the state of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the population of the territory for the investigation of the result of the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Aleva (Joe Alleva) thanked the territorial law guards for their "religion and work on behalf of justice".

In one game last season, he won 5.6 points and 2.6 outstanding bombs.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Villas Veids (Will Wade) announced that the team is "satriect" and "shit" about the death of Aida.
"That's what people always worry about," said Veid.
Vulcan sprays the lungs across Mexico
Pelni, who travels from the Pokatepetla volcano, has reached the southern coast of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans that they should not be close to the volcano within 24 hours after the activity was observed and 183 gas and gas emissions were recorded in the chart.
The Centre has observed repeated delays and trends.
Pictures on social networks have shown that cars’ windmills in Mexico’s area, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), are equipped with a plan of profit.
The geophysics have noted 45 inches (72 km) to the south-east of the volcanic activity in the capital, since 7.1 magnitudes of the earthquake have damaged the central part of Mexico in 2017.
Vulcan, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists prior to independent voting years
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the sixth day following an independent interview with the public order police, and when thousands joined the protesters' demonstrations to mark the first year since the catalytic vote on separation.
The group's machete supporters, who stopped the public order police, supported them with tears and damaged the color of powdered powder, forming dark powder in the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Disappointments are now also expected later, and police officers were using rods to prevent the beatings.
Several hours of independence support groups, complaining, "Don't forget and don't join!", were involved in a confrontation with the united supporters of the protestors, who shouted, "I love our Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 40 people were given medical assistance because of the specific trauma they experienced during the protests.
After a referendum on 1 October, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which caused Catalans, the idea of independence in the affected region remained strong.
The voters expressed firm independence, although the activities of the voters were low, and those opposed to the separation were the greatest obstacle to voting.
According to the Catalan official, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop voting at points throughout the region, causing untold harm.
Independent support groups were burning on Friday night to prevent demonstration of national police support.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose another route.
Narkiss Teremez (Narcis Termes), 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, admits that she no longer believes that Catalonia will gain independence.
"In the past year, we have experienced one of our best times.
I saw my parents ’ eyes filled with joy as they were allowed to vote, but now everything is stopped," he said.
Although the parties that support the independence of Catalonia have won a small, significant surplus in the last year, these parties have fought to maintain their progress this year, since many of the most prominent leaders have either emigrated or have been arrested and waited for a trial for their role in organizing a referendum and its subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Hoans Puigs (Joan Puig), who filmed on the phone for the support of the protest police, said that the conflict had led to two sides' politics.
"The challenge becomes even bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of nine Catholic leaders, Uriol Žunkerez (Oriol Junqueras), who has been in detention for the past year to the court, announced that he will be candidate for the European Parliament's election next year.
"Candidacy of European elections is the best way to bring back democratic values and the repressions that the Government of Spain has brought against us," he said.
London: men arrested after entering the car in the building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was repeatedly attacked against the London building.
The incident took place at the Balinarygard Crescent (Ballynagard Crescent) on Thursday about 19.30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings (Bob Blemmings) informed that the name was damaged and the building itself.
At the same time, it may be possible to get out of the kitchen at the same time.
Menga Tricienen allows "Livingston" with 1-0 win "Rangers"
Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) first round ensures "Livingston" victory
The supported "Livingston" hit "Rangers" by recording Stephen Gerard (Steven Gerrard) his second loss in 18 games called "Ibrox" club manager.
Dollyia Mengas's three-year term was decisive because the Gerija Holt (Gary Holt) team compared the situation with "Hibernian".
Jérard's team in this season did not win the guests, and the next day they have to meet the leader "Hearts" from which they leave eight points.
Before that, the European Law Day "Rangers" took place in Vienna "Rapid".
Until "Livingston" has expanded its series without losing in the divide to six games, and the main coach Holts has not yet felt a sense of humor since the previous month replaced Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
"Livingston" does not use the option against white guests
Holt's team with its direct game, which in a variety of ways made Rangers difficult, had to find in charge long before they got the names.
Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson) was released, but his attempt to put his name in front of the name, then Alan Lithgow's attempt to break the Craig Halket's line through the name line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed Rangers to play in front of him, knowing that they will be able to organize the hotels in scheduled locations.
And in that way, the names were determined.
"Rangers" was allowed to free, and "Livingston" used a corridor, Deklans Gallagher (Declan Gallagher) and Robinson combined to provide the opportunity for Menga to sit and get names from the area.
At this stage, Rangers managed a bomb, but the protection of the guests showed no interest in Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) and no one was particularly upset.
This continued on the second side, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) managed to save Kelly’s names.
Skota Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the activity of "Rangers" by Mr Alan Makgregor, and Litgovs was replaced by the long letters in the "Livingston" combination.
In the "Livingston" area, two calls continued to show the central bomb, but after the attack of Halketa on a bomb with replacer Glenn Midlton (Glenn Middleton) and on hand-playing was rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance — Analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamont (Alasdair Lamont) in "Tony Macaroni"
Fenominal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great, continuing to overcome hope by continuing to improve the gift.
His style and personality have not changed in practice since he returned to the upper echelon, but Holts has won a lot of praise for how he has joined the team since his entry.
He had so much money.
Captain Halket (Halkett) was a giant, holding the first organized protection, while Menga made sure that Connors Goldson (Connor Goldson) and Joe Vorals (Joe Worrall) always kept the mood.
But Rangers is missing.
Despite how well they had been in Gerard’s hands, they were far from these standards.
Their last bomb was timeless — only once they entered the farm area — and this is basically an invitation to bring back "Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdoganu is waiting for shared feelings
On Saturday (September 29th), when the Turkish and German leaders were in the booklets in Berlin, there was a lot of blue and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATOs.
They have differences of opinion on various issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to the Valley to open a new giant museum.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, for the sake of security, blocked the huge effort of 25,000 people, not allowing them to stand in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters went in to see their president.
Seven protestors against Erdogan, a large part of which were cowards, also made known his attitude by stating both Erdogan's policy and the German government’s decision to take him to himself.
The mutual protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by the guests whose part of Germany's Turkey is considered to be a hurricane, while others are deniated as autocrats.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: the driver dies in traffic with a car
In a car crash in London, a car driver went down the wrong road.
The encounter took place in the Bestwood Street cross-country with Evelyn Street, on the road with intense traffic in Deptford (Deptford), in the south-east of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The car manager stopped and helped the doctors, but the man calmed down.
The encounter took place several months after another bicycle driver arrived in the Childers Street.
The police officer of the capital reported that the police are working on the identification of a man and informing his neighbors.
In the event site, roads are closed and bused, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin injury: six employees injured during an accident
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were injured in an irregular situation of men in a severe condition.
The incident occurred in the "HMP Long Lartin" in the village of Vorchestershire about 9.30 BST Sunday and will continue.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight prisoners and restricted in one case, the staff of the Special Service "Tornado" were involved
In the event of an accident, the staff were treated with mild eye pain.
The representative of the Prison Service announced: "In order to resolve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, a special training staff was involved.
Six staff members were provided medical assistance because of the trauma.
We are not in a position to deal with violence in our prisons and to make it clear that the officers will be sent to the police and that they will probably spend more time behind the rest."
"HMP Long Lartin" has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most violent criminals in the country.
In June, the victim was reported to be in a medical hospital after the victim was attacked.
And in October last year, officials responsible for dumping were sent to prison to resolve serious irregularities in which staff had been attacked with billiard bombs.
Orcans Roza Féniks, Las Vegas and Soltleksia with sudden floods (probably benefit from the situation in the areas affected by drought)
Arison from tropical depression is rarely, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of the next week, when Orcina Rosa, with the rest of her strength, will move across the dense southern regions, creating a sudden flow risk.
The National Weather Service (National Weather Service) has already issued a warning of sudden floods to the eastern part of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southern part of California and the South, including Féniks, Flagstafu, Las Vegas and Soltleksia.
It is expected that the next day, Rosa will move directly through Fênica, starting with the case after tomorrow.
The National Meteorological Service in Fênica pointed out that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical wind or depression status in 200 sails (320 km) from Fênica!
Katrina (1967) was a 40-mile (65 km) hurricane from the AZ border."
The most recent models of the National Hurcane Center are forecasting 2-4 columns (~5.08–10.2 cm) of greenhouse gases, reaching up to 6 columns (15.24 cm).
Other south-easterly areas, including the central part of the Klinšu mountain and the Great Base, may receive 1-2 columns (~2,54-5.08 cm) in separate locations with up to 4 columns (~10.2 cm).
Those who are not at risk of sudden floods can become famous because the region has visited droughts.
Although the possibility of flooding is very serious, some of the gas is likely to be good, as the South is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor (Dought Monitor) survey, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's suffering from at least the extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
For the first time, the Orcian Roza route to Lake California (Baja California) on the coast of Mexico, where it will reach the shore.
Rosa is still with orchestra power from the morning with the maximum wind speed of 85 June (137 km) per hour, is approximately 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eiženia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and is heading north with the speed of 12 June (19 km).
The wind encounters the coolest waters of the Pacific Ocean, and so it grows.
It is therefore expected that the hurricane with tropical wind will reach the coast in Mexico on the afternoon or from the morning.
In the natural gas sector, Mexico may be strong at risk of significant flooding.
"It is expected that the gas will reach 3-6 columns (7.62–15.24 cm) from the southern part of Lake California in the south-east of Sonor, possibly reaching 10 columns (25.4 cm)," said weather.com.
Rose will move north, across Mexico as a tropical wind and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday about tomorrow as a tropical depression, which will then go through Arizona and go to your south after midnight.
"The major threat expected from Rosa or her remains is very powerful in the gas in Lejaskalifornia, in the northern part of Sonor and in the southern United States," said the National Orcán Centre.
It is expected that these things will lead to life-threatening sudden floods and deep floods, and earthquakes in mountain areas.

Tramps argues that Kaveno is suffering from the "devils and Spirits" of the Democratic Party.
"Balse as Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the cruel and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at the meeting in Villing (Wheeling), West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno was suffering from the "dangerousness and thoughts" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno witnessed in front of Congress, where he strongly and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by the Christian Blasey Ford, when both were teenagers.
Forda also witnessed in the hearing of his complaints.
The President announced on Saturday that "Americans have now emerged" Kaveno's "extraordinaryity, ability and fear".
"The blessing of the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of our most educated lawyers in the history of Sponsorship in the service of the people," he announced in support of the efforts of the supporters in Western Virginia.
President Kaveno referred to the environment with regard to the importance of the activities of the Republican people in the interdepartmental elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm a candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going to go all the way, fighting for great candidates."
Tramps argues that democracies have taken the mission "to protest and oppose".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the appointment of Kaveno will be held no later than five days later, the CNN informed the senior assistant of the governing party of the Republican Party.
Seven people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of children is increasing
On Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many simply disappeared when giant wolves marched against the shores after the powerful earthquake and tsunamis visited the Indonesian island of Sulvalis.
On Friday at the festival in Palu, hundreds of people had fallen on the holy plains, when up to six feet (18 feet) high, they turned against the rocks in the direction of the shore, putting many to death and collecting all that was found on their way.
Cunami was born after a 7.5-ball violent earthquake.
"When the threat was created last night, people still worked on the plane and didn't run immediately, and they became victims," BNPB, representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Suptopo Purwo Nugroho), informed Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't get the same thing, it brought cars, balls and buildings, it loved everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunamis had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people took the goat to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
The photos taken at the airport of the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and broken roofs, and water-contained museums.
The next day, the coastal town continued to be busy for six days.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a report by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPT, it was pointed out that the energy distributed by massive underground power in five days exceeded 200 times during World War II to the nuclear power assigned to Hirosim during the second world war.
The city’s location wall, at the end of the short line, may have enhanced the size of the city.
Nigroho’s positions were described as "wide", and it was reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that some of the dead bodies were found buried under the walls of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho believes that the number and positions of the birds could be greater than 300 km (190 km) of the coastal line on the north of Palu, in the territory of Dongala (Dongala), which is located near the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications were completely confused, no information was received from Dongala," Nugroho informed.
More than 300,000 people live there," Sarkanais crossed the Communication, adding that its staff and volunteers are being given to affected regions in the disaster.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could be even worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the Agency was strongly criticized for not informing that the tsunamis had visited Palau, although officials claimed that the waves had entered during the alarm.
A video published on social networks is heard that a man at the top of the building warmly calls people on the street, approaching tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the water wall is heading towards the shore, separating the buildings and the machinery.
The Reuters News Agency was unable to confirm immediately whether the material is true.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power, which closed the communication of the Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue.
The attackers reported that the army had begun sending cargo machines with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the refugees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been opened only for aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Vidodo) evacuate center Palu planned to visit Sunday.
In Indonesia, the number of children more than 800.
That's very bad.
Mr Doseba (Dosoba) told us that the World Vision staff who had successfully arrived in the city of Palu from Dongala (Dongla) and now had a generous stay at the office's office office in the course of a long post.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that were damaged," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when the aid groups have been committed to organizing assistance for victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with great experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian legislation, the financing, resources and personnel of overseas organisations may only come into existence if the postal territory is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the provincial level," said the representative of Aulia Ariani (Aulia Ariani) of the Indonesian Sarkana Cross.
"When the government announces, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but such status is not yet defined."
When Palu arrived the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members still didn’t find any hope that their love would become a miracle that would make life more bright during the natural disaster.
A small child was born on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who had been imprisoned under the cover of darkness for two days near her mother’s bed.
Gendon Subandon (Gendon Subbandon), the trainer of the Indonesian national para-gladers team, was ready for two of the missing Asian enthusiasts that took place this month in Indonesia earlier.
The other guests in the hotel "Roa Roa" including Mr Mandagi (Mandagi) were their farmers.
"As an experienced nurse," he said, "I'm learning emotions."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after a para-glade team distributed news of the crash at the Roa Roa Hotel, he had been sending the "WhatsApp" reports for hours to Palu's members who participated in the plenary festival.
However, the result of his report was only one single mark, not two green marks.
"I think this means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
Backs up to $26,750 in the Newport on the Levee set
According to a statement by the Department of Police of Newport (Newport), the staff of the Newport on the Levee complex was arrested on Friday morning at $26,750 "Brink's" staff.
"The driver of the car blew out a explosion kit ATM and was ready to fill it with a bigger amount of money," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in press release.
While the manager was arrested, another man "from the back came down to the Brink's employee" and stole a sum of money for the banknote.
According to the press release, several suspects left the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identity should contact Newport police 859-292-3680.
Kanje Vests: re-changes his name to Je
Reperis Kanje Vests changes his name to Yes (Yes).
Reporting on a change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Betne who knew before as Kanji West."
41-year-old Vests has been called Je for a while, and used the name "Ye" as his eighth album, published in June.
This change takes place before she shows up on "Saturday Night Live," where he will, as expected, put his new album "Yandhi".
These writers tell us that he is now replacing singer Arinu Grandi, who has stopped work on "emotional causes".
The garment has been told that it is not only his current professional word cut, but it is also a religious matter.
"I believe that "Yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "Tu," Vests explained earlier this year by discussing his album name with director Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed it "Ye", which is sold for our good and bad, for our souls, for everything.
The album is more about what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, who has so far been known as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was giving preference to the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love Brother).
JAY-Z, who had previously worked with West, has also not used the signs of mind and great scars.
The elected President of Mexico accuses the non-use of weapons against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians during the 50th anniversary of the blood-response to the students.
Lopes Obradors promised on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" "never use the army to oppress the people of Mexico."
The peaceful demonstration of the military unit was held on 2 October 1968, killing even 300 people during the summer when the student movements were scattered throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obradors has been eager to support young Mexicans in years, to give a monthly grant to the students and to open more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education could be included in the gangs of young criminals.
The US should double funding for artistic intellectuals
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artistic intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, a clear investor and an artificial intelligence practical Kai Fu Lee (Qai-Fu Lee), which has worked "Google", "Microny" and "Apple".
The comments were made after various U.S. government bodies made announcements on artistic intelligence, although in general there is a lack of a strategy in the field of artistic intelligence.
Until last year China started its plan: its goal is to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Two-fold artificial intellectual research budgets will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and are expected to follow the next cardiac approach in the field of artistic intelligence," said Li.
In an interview with the CNBC this week, Li said that double funding could increase the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artistic intelligence will be made in the United States.
The book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("Citizen of intellectual resources: China, Silicon Islands and the New World Order") was published in the series "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", by the Executive Director of the Synovation Ventures", who has invested funds in one of the most important artistic intellectual companies in China "Face+".
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon (Kärnegi-Melona) University worked to create an artistic intellectual system that would review the best "Othello" player in America, but later he was a "Microsoft Research" employee and "Google" president of the China branch.
It recognises the expertise of previous United States government organised technologies such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and the question when it will be prepared to identify people with ideas about the future.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," says Li.
"China is no longer urging leading scientists, but the big companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have dedicated university plays to the work of art intellectuals over the past few years.
It adds that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to improve its achievements in the field of artistic intelligence.
"I think that green maps should automatically be given to people with the degrees of philosophy of the doctor in the field of artistic intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council published its next creative intellectual development plan.
It was explained that the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence (U.S. Defense Department) has established a joint artistic intelligence centre in which partners from industry and academic branches are being merged, and the White House has announced the establishment of a special committee on artistic intelligence issues.
And this year DARPA (the Central Research and Development Organisation of the Ministry of Defence) announced a 2 billion-dollar large investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
On the other hand, the National Science Fund is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artistic intellectual research.
As long as the United States legislation on the establishment of the National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence has not worked for several months.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the referendum on the change in national name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in the referendum on whether to change their national name to the "Republic of Montenegro", by taking a step that would prevent long-term negotiations with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests for the establishment of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbour's name shows claims to its territory and has taken steps to take Macedonia into account NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists in the opposition argue that the changes included the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Serb majority.
President Gjorge Ivanovs (Gorge Ivanov) said that in the non-voting referendum, and the campaign called for a stop has raised concerns about whether the electoral activity will achieve at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The report raises the question: "You are involved in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoranu Zajev (Zoran Zaev), argue that it is a price worth paying off the road to Macedonia, one of the countries born after the South-South collapse, to become an organisation, such as the EU and NATO members.
"I have come to vote on the future of the country, on Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely in the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgeevska (Olivera Georgievska) in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, many MEPs have announced that they will take account of the outcome of the vote that will become decisive.
In order to change the name, there will be a 2/3 majority in Parliament.
The Commission informed the national election that no infringements were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, which voted 66 per cent of the registered electorate.
"I'm going to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Joey Tanevskis (Goose Tanevski), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zorans Zajevs, his wife Zorika (Zorica) and his son Duško (Dushko) voted in a referendum in Macedonia on a change of national name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumic (Strumica) in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov) prepared a few views and painted the colours of the halls that were raised by those who were in the referendum.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to stand with our head raised, not through the door of service," Kavadarkovs said.
"We are a small country, but we have the truth.
If they do not want us to adopt as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs argues that NATO participation will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that most votes will be voted for because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
In a discussion published last morning by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research (Macedonia's Institute for Research), 30–43% of voters — less than the necessary activity — appear to be involved in the referendum.
Another discussion conducted by the Macedonian Telema TV found that 57 per cent of the vote on Sunday was planned to take part in the vote.
70 per cent of them replied that the vote was correct.
For the referendum to be successful, the activities of the voters must be 50 per cent and another one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious obstacle to the Western-oriented government, which came to power in May last year.
View: Mancestras "City" Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) runs through the entire "Brighton" protection to get the names
Serhio Agvero and Rahim Sterlings (Raheem Sterling) contributed to the protection of "Brighton" by allowing Manchester "City" on Saturday "Etihad" in Manchester, England to win at 2:0.
Agvero showed that his reputation had been quite light in 65 minutes.
Argentinian shooters received a game in the middle of the village at the beginning of the combination.
He found out between three Brighton guards, and he was in the open field.
Then Agvero's abducts four green circles.
He drove a bomb to one of the defenses, and then he crossed several more at Brighton's farm.
Then he played the game on his own when he reached Starling.
The English center shooter used his first shot to play back Agvero, who had a good football jacket in the case to reach the "Brigton" guard Metjū Rainenu (Mathew Ryan), tripping the bomb network on the right side.
"Agvero's games with foot problems," "City" manager Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We have discussed with him to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were told that he got names at that time.
But it was Sterlings, who provided the original advantage of Sky Blues in the Premier League.
The doors were reached at 29 minutes.

Chercher wants to solve the issues "Rockies"
Since the Nationals did not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to start again.
But Schercers (Scherzer) who is always ready to realize that on Sunday you can use the option against the Colorado "Rockies", but only if "Rockies" will be the current exclusion games. And "Rockies" in the National West League group is run with one game against the Los Angeles "Dodgers".
"Rockies" has published at least a white card with Friday night at 5:2 to beat "Nationals", but has not yet won its first title divide.
"Although we play the same game, at least we will be able to explain, knowing that the light is here, in Denver, with the effort and the other team, it is possible to be the most dangerous of all I'm dealing with this year.
And why would I not feel guilty?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but as a letter, it is ready to let the Shercera make a date.
Chercher, for which it will be at the beginning of the 34th, held a mid-term session on the outside of the "bullpen" section on Thursday, and on Sunday the usual rest of the year will be in a bomb.

The president spoke of the situation in which his elected High Court candidate, Bret Kaveno, spoke at the same time about the importance of the activities of the Republican electorate.
"In November everything we've done is threatened.
Five weeks to one of our most important elections in our time.
This is really very, very serious: I am not a candidate, but I am a candidate, and that is why I am fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this crazy, ridiculous radical group of democracies that is doing right now.
And they have committed to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see the evil, the opposite.
They have the same skills that they will have to overcome in order to gain power and control, that is why they want power and control, and we won't do it to them."
Democrats, he said, have taken the mission "to protest and oppose".
"And you have seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, the so-called democracies of "no, no, no, no, no, no."
He named it the Senator of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee of Justice, Diana Feinstein (Dianne Feinstein), to whom the observers responded with strong applause.
"Do you remember her answers?
Have you misled the document?
Hmm, what's going on?
No, hmm, go on, it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Liberal Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It's inappropriate for the open.
It was no wonder that "Momentum" activists in my local party wanted me to be in the center.
Finally, I am in the last row of Members of the parliament of the Liberal Party, who knew that he did not want to — all because we do not hide our views.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, in my parliament, had a similar attack because she was committed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement of censorship criticized me for not joining Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn).
The importance of economic policy, national security, Europeans – ironically, but these were issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
On Friday, the announcement on the Liberals meeting in the eastern part of Notingem stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
The majority of the meetings that took place during my eight-year career as a member of the local liberal parliament were just like that.
Unfortunately, today's many meetings are bright, and the promises of a "more peaceful" policy have already been forgotten if it has ever been.
It has become increasingly clear that the Liberal Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any opinion is valued depending on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began soon after the leader became Jeremy: colleagues whom I think our political views are similar, began to expect me to look at 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have agreed on in other cases — whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I speak in public — and, in fact, it is not important — to follow the analysis of the use of social networks by calling for a ban on candidateing the next elections by relieving the central policy by saying that I have no place in the Liberal Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have benefited more than part of my colleague, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues, who daily encounter sexists and find out about the horrors, but I never try to avoid them.
One of the most satisfying aspects of this political era is how normal it has become.
In the past week, Jeremy Corbins announced that the Leiborist Party had to bury the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity of views and with every expression of distrust or change of election rules.
In the last two years, I have often given advice by not reading on the steps, thinking about what I said, and then I'll be fine with it.
But that is not why I choose to take part in politics.
Ever since I joined the Liberians for 32 years back as a schoolboy, responding to the opposition of the Techer government, which my integrated school class had deliberately led to the collapse, I have been committed to fighting for better public services for those who are most in need, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political views, nor my previous wishes.
No one in the east of Notingem had any reason to doubt my position on political matters and in areas where the existing government would not be affected.
To those who made the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at the time when the state committed towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand this desire to spend my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
However, the only thing I would like to report is not the idea of Nottingem "Momentum", but to my voters, whether they are well-being members: I am pleased that I can serve you, and I am convinced that no threat to the petitioning or reminding you that no one in politics is unreputable, will not stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": The "Ayr" comes from the top row table
The last two attempts are likely to have a certain degree of confusion, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has won a triumph in this exciting Scottish champion's game today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only uncalled ten team.
In the end, it was their great protection, as well as the much better spending that led the families, and Peter Murchie's coach is all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've checked all our games and we're still not connected, so I have to admit," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Kristyjs (Robyn Christie): "All honor "Ayr," they used their performance better than we do."
Grant Anderson (Grant Anderson)'s 14-minute attempt, carried out by Freeziers Klimo (Frazier Climo), led to "Ayr", but in the yellow you painted a suit for Captain Roryam Hüh (Rory Hughes), where the game was awarded "Warriors", changed the "Melrose" numbers, and Jason Begotts (Jason Baggot) found an unrealized bomb.
The climate increased the control of "Ayr" with punishment, right at the end of the half hour, he got points, then made a solo attempt, until the "Ayr" stopped with 17-5.
However, the "Melrose" season began with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to realize Begots reduced the return to 5 points.
Then there was a long break because Ruys Nott (Rouridh Knott) gained a severe trauma and was on the ground-breaking prom from the village, but when the game started, "Ayr" quickly turned to the front when Staford McDowell (Stafford McDowell) took the test that was carried out by the climate.
The "Ayr" Captain Blairs Mcferson (Blair Macpherson) then received a yellow card, and already, after an intense pressure, "Melrose" used a bigger player — with the Brassa Colvine (Bruce Colvine) attempt that was not realized.
However, the owners agreed, and when Struans Hačinsson (Stroan Hutchinson) received a yellow card for passing the climate without a bomb, from the prison corridor, Makferson carried out the exact "Ayr" molluscs in the backyard.
The climate came to an end, just as before, almost from the very beginning when Kails Rouves (Kyle Rowe) was forced into the field of David Armstrong's forces and sent the flag player Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt.
Still Game star, seems to plan a new career in a restaurant business
The comedy series "Still Game" star for Fords Kirnans (Ford Kieran), seems to be planning to engage in a hotel business because they discovered that he was named as director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis (Jack Jarvis) in a popular BBC show that he formed and shared with his former partners in the comedy of Greg Hemphilu (Greg Hemphil).
The Duets have announced that the next ninth season will be the last of this, and Kirnan has apparently planned his life after Kreiglanga (Craigglang).
According to official information, he is the Director of the "Afforn Limited".
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of "Scottish Sun" indicated that Kirnans was planning to participate in the "extraordinary restaurant business".
"Yours belong to us!": in the dry ground Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Cluso Ocean
The seamen are on their way to the shores of the Fleets Stápas.
The public buildings have been covered by ocean blue flags.
Fleet-based ships from the Lake of Titikas, until the Amazon is detached by the waves: "We have the right to the sea.
Their recovery is our duty."
The memory of Chile in the bloody conflict in the 19th century on the loss of resources is still alive, just as it has been a long time since it has been sailing back to the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is likely to be the highest for several decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice for a five-year review on 1 October.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and of course, with a positive view of the outcome," declared Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many of the Bolivarians will turn to the International Court of Justice in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Håga tribunal will agree on the requirement of Bolivia that, after several decades, with the interruptions in negotiations, Chile is obliged to discuss the sovereign exits to the sea to be granted to Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic local president Evo Morales (Evo Morales), who is waiting for a war to be fought next year, is also very interested in the judgment on the first day.
"We're close to finding the Cluso ocean," he felt at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the judgment for the good of Bolivia is unlikely, and even if it is adopted, there are no major changes.
In the Netherlands, the founded UN body is not empowered to grant Chile's territory and its representatives have said that there will be no possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is adopted six months after its final review shows that the case was "not complicated", explained international legislative expert Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And in the last four years, Bolivia's case has not moved forward, but, just secondly, it's over.
"The question of access to the sea has been raised by the existing Bolivian administration," said Zarate.
Morale's military retrieval is in the hands of the rest of us, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate once and for all, but after this it will be very difficult to hold the debate.
The two countries have not changed the messages since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia, Mr Håga, to whom President Eduardo Rodriges Velze (Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze) did not agree that the decision of the Court was not normally taken quickly.
The first day of Bolivia will bring "a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to join point 139 years of long conflicts from which both parties will get," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — another of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used maritime problems as a political tool.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Clussian Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to discuss what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will withdraw from nuclear weapons only when we can trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho), said that his people would never lose their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments appeared during the period when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) appeared to be ready to launch diplomatic measures to prevent a nuclear nuclear failure more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's leader Kimu Chennu.
It is said that it is "fathasias" to expect the US to continue to reject sanctions and to refuse to declare the end of the Korean war, ever leaving North Korea on its way.
Vashington is careful with regard to the declaration of consent before Fenjan will take significant disarmament measures.
Mr. Kims, both President Donald Tramps and President of the United States, would like a second visit.
However, many are skeptical about the fact that Phenyan really wants to turn away from a weapon that the country certainly considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the next Kima trip with Trampu.
Paris fashions show with the latest massive headphones line on your way to the nearest High Street
If you want to increase your Cebulus collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne (Thom Browne) introduced viewers with a series of absurd, deeply rooted objects in the 2019 spring / summer season collection, which appeared on a set style background on the Paris fashion week.
The inactivative bells have been exaggerating "Instagram" this evening, and these designers have sent their impressive achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding appearance was the color of a purple-colored cuppe with a color-like flat blue that covered the head.
Massive accessories were made up of bees, beads, and even pineapples — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brauns also showed the devil’s mask — just before Helovin’s death.
Many of the colorful masks were decorated, and they were later attached to Hannibal Lecter, not to the high fashion.
One of the compositions reminded me of the amount of breathing, with pipes and glasses, while the other, in the same way, caused the smell of freezing.
And, if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the real time has come.
Style viewers think that a lot of lessons are possible on your way to the nearest High Street.
The large-scale ceptor soon became popular after the show of "La Bomba" — the salmu cept with two feet (~60 cm) in width seems to have swept all from Rianna to Emelia Rattivsky (Emily Rattakowski).
The very ineffective status of a cult object on all social networks has led to another great triumph on the minds of the people — the wild platoons, almost as big as the platooned model that carries them.
The sum of the oil refinery, made up of the coffee bars and equipped with white leather belts, took a special place in the 2019 collection of "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in the Paris fashion week.

John Edwards: Language Knowledge is essential to citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools are the reputation of excellent educational institutions, and this has been preserved in 2018 when the results of the recent examinations have been further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, art and other public activities.
The aim of this school, where there are about 30,000 students in Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to provide the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their farmers for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their life as world citizens.
As the education sector, which can develop and introduce special school programmes, we see that today’s languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to people in the language he understands, it will keep him informed.
If you speak in his native language, it will remain in his heart."
This is a reassuring reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain trust from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are located on the top of the bed table with the highest level of examinations in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who were learning foreign languages reached the highest score A.
Skotu's Independent School Board data on 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest sign in Chinese A, and 72 percent also received the same sign that acquired German, 69 percent who acquired French and 63 percent who acquired Spanish.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland is as vital as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed in the future for children and young people.
Now languages like the choice of subject are valued in independent school programmes as high as science, technology, engineering and mathematics groups.
In 2014, the Commission for Employment and Skills of the United Kingdom found that 17 per cent of employers were unable to meet the shortage of language skills due to the failure of the holiday.
So more and more language skills are needed to prepare young ones for their future careers.
To increase the opportunities for work that will require the knowledge of languages, these skills are important in a globalized world.
In the future, regardless of the chosen career, they will have the true advantage of such a long - term skill.
The ability to communicate directly to people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several languages.
According to YouGov’s 2013 survey, involving more than 4000 adults in Britain, 75 percent did not understand foreign enough to hold a conversation, but the French language was the only one speaking two-digit population, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to learn investment languages.
More languages, especially the skills of developing countries, will give children a better opportunity to work hard.
Schools in Scotland vary in language.
Some schools will focus more on today's languages, while others will learn other languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain’s future, in line with the 2020 plans.
Even if your child is interested, independent schools will always be able to choose from a variety of languages, and teachers will be experts in the field concerned.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to achieve success in the future.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young Scotia this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done (It has to be done).
John Edwards is Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron's Debt "Lakers" on Sunday Sandjugo
Fani have finally waited for the time when Lebrona's first game will take place in Los Angeles "Lakers".
"Lakers" coach Luks Volton (Luke Walton) has announced that James will play on Sunday the opening of the first season against the Denver "Nuggets" Sandjugo.
Still, he has to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one but less than 48," Voltons informed "Lakers" on the official website.
"Lakers" Reporter Mike Trudell (Maiks Trudels) wrote on Twitter that James would probably be playing a limited number of minas.
In addition to the practice that took place this week, James asked about his plans for the "Lakers" six first season series.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need the first season games to prepare," he said.
Trip stop time in West Virginia, canal YouTube
President Donald Tramps is launching a series of interviews in Villing, West Virginia today.
This is the first of five Trampla girls scheduled for the next week, including staying in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his election for the release of a free place in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the aim of Trampa is to receive support from the pending interim election, as it is likely that the Republicans will lose control at Congress in November after the vote has been taken.
What events will take place today in West Virginia, and how can you see them online?
Trampa's guest in Villing, West Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings, after the ET today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch online online via YouTube in the West Bank.
It is likely that Tramps will be talking about hearing this week in the case of the Supreme Court candidate Brita Kaveno, who has been charged with gender crimes, and is expected to vote in Senate to remain approved for a week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
However, the main objective of this summit is to help improve the situation of the republics expected to be elected in November.
Thus, President Trampa's campaign shows that the task of the next five girls in the next week is "to activate volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they belong to in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress for his work is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible because we are starting an active campaign season," said the representative of the Trampa campaign, who did not want to reveal his name.
This evening, planned "Wesbanco Arena" in Villing, it is possible to join supporters from "Ohaijo and Pennsylvania, and reflect them in Pittsburgh's media," says West Virginia Metro News.
There will be a second time in the last month when Tramps will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 per cent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help the candidate for the West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is left behind in the debate.
"It is not a good sign to Morise that the President must come in to help improve his results in the discussions," said Professor Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, according to Simon Haeder.
Raider Cuss 2018: The United States has demonstrated its commitment to fight to keep a great day of hope for the singles
After three sessions in "one word" on Wednesday's game form "forsome" could be exactly what was needed for this Raider box.
Sportsmen like to talk about the conflicts of action, and they really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
So, on what side of him is he now successful?
"They were in charge of six points, but now with four, as I think it means in my own words that the success will affect us," said Jordan Spitts (Jordan Spieth) to give in their hopes.
Europe, of course, is an advantage because it is in line with 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
The effort made it clear that the Americans believe that the wind blows in their mouths and they have cause for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spita and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas) who played together all day, and each of them can enjoy three points of four.
The effort has been destroyed from the first side, to the medicine, and is an example of the winner.
The winning bells became more loud when his round went on, made a decisive step in the middle of the bridge to achieve four times the same number when he and Thomas were back on two sides after two.
In the face of his victory 15 , he was arrested with a similar appeal, of them, for his belief that the American team had not yet been sent.
"You really have to dig deep, and you have to worry about your fate," Spitt said.
This is all that's left for these players.
18 meetings to achieve success.
The only players who have won more points over the last two days than Spits and Tomass are Frankesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, who will no doubt enter the history of this Raider case.
Europe’s devils, but the attractive few remain four points and will not be able to harm them.
Molivuds was the only couple who went out on the sixth day without a clue, but they also avoided the bogies on the sixth day, on the fifth day on the afternoon and on the ninth afternoon on the fifth day of the morning.
This desire and the way their energy flows into this exciting effort and again proves that they are players who must die on Sunday, and Flytvuds and Molinari will be the most popular players that can provide a potential European victory when the sun passes through Le Golf National.
At the same time, we both have different tastes.
However, the discussions on European triumphs were timely.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Webs Simpson (Webb Simpson) were quickly finished with the morning "fourballs" in the form of Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
The bogies and two doubles in the front nine brought Spain and the stars into the lake, and they were not even close enough to learn from them.
But on Sunday no one will help you to end it.
The games "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction, to observe what advice they provide, and what not, and how the strategy can change the situation in the acupuncture.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last few days it has been in a long run, but this competition in the form of "forsome" has shown that the US team is committed to fighting what many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
The last day of the European election is 10-6
The European exhibition of Raider's cause will begin in a pleasant management day after the end of the six-day competition with the "fourball" and "foursome" against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were in charge of two victories over the heavy working Tager Vauds (Tiger Woods), which increased the number of Le Golf Nationals up to four.
Tomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) European team to maintain the trophies lost two years ago in the form of an inaccurate American team in the morning competition for "fourballs", and the result of the series was 3-1.
The U.S. was more powerful than the "forsomes" in the form of two masks, but it was unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Farika (Jim Furyk) team needs 8 points on Sundays in 12 single games to keep the trophies.
Flytvuds is the first European prime minister who acquired four points in line with Molinari, chosen for Mollivud ("Mollwood") after a seasonal weekend, only two times in the history of the Raider case, which received four points in the first four games.
In the form of "fourballs" by Patrick Reed and Patrick Reed, they then played with no difficulty in the game, said to the young Brazilian and American Brazilian Deschambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with even more impressive results of 5&4.
The year that won two games on Saturdays showed a great game, but he has lost 19 of the 29 pieces in "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, as well as seven by order.
Justin Rouss (Justin Rose) was relieved before the morning of the game "forballs", returned to partner Henrik Stanson (Henrik Stenson) "forsomes", to connect with 2&1 Dastin Johnson and Brooks Keepka, who takes the first and second place in the world's ranking.
Europe did not succeed in achieving its full success, although in the southern part of Paris it was pleasant and easy to travel.
Three times the most prestigious golf competition winner, Jordan Spitt and Justin Tomass, determined the vital Americans with two points a week.
They printed 2&1 against the Spanish Johns Ram (John Rahm) and Ian Polter (Ian Poulter) "forballs" and returned later to connect Polter and Roryi Makróy (Rory McIlroy) with 4&3 "forsomes" after the first two matches had been lost.
Only two times in Raider's history team has played 4 points of weakness in single games, but as owners, Farika (Furyk) team only has an undisclosed result to keep the trophies.
After two days in the second place, the day-to-day counterattack will appear to be a problem.
North Korea declared that "any" would not be singled out without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and that in such a situation North Korea would not, in any case, withdraw from its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongs Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the world's annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has been empowered by "a significant set of good wishes", such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the detonation of nuclear testing and the promise never to spread nuclear and nuclear technologies.
"However, we do not see the appropriate response of the US," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we won't trust our country's security, and in such circumstances we won't fight the first."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean translations of the opposition to the "progressive" access to denuclearization, according to which Korea would be compensated for step-by-step action, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Phenjan had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement of Kima Čenuna and Donalda Trampa at the first meeting of the US President and North Korean leadership meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim agreed to work to achieve "Korea side denuclearization", while Tramps promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to officially end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has announced that Phennan must first withdraw from its nuclear weapons.
Vashington has also not responded to the call to facilitate serious international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"ASV argues that "denuclearization must be first," and increases the level of pressure created by sanctions in order to achieve the goal of power, even against the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could push us on the way is empty fantasies that people who don't know about us.
The problem is, however, that continuing sanctions only deepens our distrust."
He did not speak about the intentions of the second Kima meeting with Trampu, which the U.S. leader had specifically mentioned in the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically attended three meetings with the South Korean leader Munu Jae-in during the last five months, adding: "If the other side of the issue of denuclearization were South Korea, other than the United States, the Korean side's denuclearization would not have taken place in that direction."
However, Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he announced in the UN General Assembly that the decision of North Korea's rockets on the U.S. continent was inevitable after Mr. Tramps had named Kim on the suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Tramps, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her fear of taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much work to be done, and sanctions must be kept until North Korea is denuclearized.
The third day, Tramps announced that he had not planned a particular time, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia emphasize the need for the UN Security Council to repay Phenyan for what has been done.
However, the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with energy, without allowing errors, until a final and credible denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions since 2006, trying to achieve the exclusion of the financing of the Phenyan nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and was then informed that he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for another visit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He came from Phenyan in July, saying that progress has been made, but in a few hours, North Korea has accused him of "gangster's valuable requirements".
The North Korea meeting with Munu this month was committed to demobilizing the weapons polygon and nuclear complex if the United States is going to take "adequate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that "relevant measures" that North Korea wanted to see are security guarantees that Tramps promised Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University will learn the subject of how to rest
The new subject of education at Harvard University this year has resulted in more students crying, and this is an attempt to address the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes the study of caffeine over-study through the nights.
One author discovered that the best university students in the world are often not even aware of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the subject of education that he considers to be the first subject of this kind of education in the United States.
His enthusiasm for creating a new subject of education was created after he became aware of the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and asked, "Why does she tell me this just now when I'm at the last stage?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important it is to sleep — which I was surprised by, he told me, "Telegraph."
This year, the first time in class, the subject of education provides students with basic information on how well-being contributes to success in education and sport as well as improved overall well-being.
Paul Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of Health Services of the University, informed that the university decided to conduct a course after learning that students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
An hour-long training process includes an interactive series of tasks.
One of the parts is a picture of the house doors where students click on coffee tables, dishes, sports bags and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light and how the supply affects sleeplessness and how important the cooling routine is.
In another section, students are informed about how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a student's city map with interactive icons invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture in which the ability to learn all night still exists and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness became a more serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, tension and fear, and even to prevent weight gain, as the lack of sleep prevents the mind from turning into a test mode, making it ever out.
Reimonds So (Raymond So), a 19-year-old californy studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop the subject of education after he attended one of the professor's lectures last year, in the first course of Harvard.
He said that the subject of education had opened his eyes and motivated him to get a course available to all the students.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who receive post-graduate education to obtain a similar programme before going to study competition.
Professor Čeislers recommends students to set up a modulator not only at the time they wake up, but also when they are going to sleep, as well as to keep people in mind how the "green light" damages people's display of electronic devices and LED lamps, because they can trigger daily rhythms, making it difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's name is aghast Jérard's men
"Rangers" also visited another gruesome game guests when Dolly Menga (Dolly Menga) visited Steven Gerrard (Steven Gerrard's commander's decision 1 - 0 against "Livingston".
The "Ibrox" team wanted to win the first win since February 4:1 triumfa "St Johnstone", but the Gerija Holt (Gary Holt) team made his second lose in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is at 8 points away from the Scottish champion leader "Hearts".
Menga started the bomb seven minutes before the end of half-life, and the lack of Rangers' input was never considered after trying to compare the result.
"Rangers" takes up to the sixth place, whereas "Livingston" moves to the third, and in a sense, only "Hibernian".
And Rangers may have another problem, because Judge Kalum Spence needed medical help because of the trauma of the head, which was apparently caused by the next end of the sentence.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which immediately left behind the wall of "Ayr", reaching the "Betfred" corner end.
At the same time, Holts used the same 11 players "Livingston" that bought "Hearts" one point last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-directed team pressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that Rangers managed a bomb more often, but Livingston better used what he was doing.
They had to get names already two minutes after the start of the first game, when Mengas sent Scott Pittman to Alana McGregor (Allan McGregor), but the center player managed his great chance.
Then, after the release of Keaghan Jacobs, the captain of the Kreugu Halket (Craig Halket) arrived, but his partner, Alans Litgov (Alan Lithgow), was able to cause the bomb only for a long way behind the wall.
"Rangers" took control, but showed that it was expected to be played in the last third, rather than believed it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) no doubt felt that he had to make a sentence within 15 minutes after he had agreed with Steven Lawles, but Judge Stevens Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the Colombian appeal.
"Rangers" did only two sides for the first half, but the former "Ibrox" guard of Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed, not Lassana Coulibaly, not a reliable end to the attack by Ovi Edžaria (Ovie Ejaria).
Although Livingston may have changed the time of the game at 34 minutes, no one can deny that they have already benefited from their efforts.
"Rangers" was no longer the final combination of Jacobs' planned horse.
Scott Erfilds (Scott Arfield) did not respond when Deklans Gallagher (Declan Gallagher) created a bomb for Scott Robinson, which maintained balance and chose for the simple end of Meng.
Gerard's break was replaced by Ryan Kent (Ryan Kent), and it almost immediately affected the game because he sent the bomb Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line was soon to block the year.
But "Livingston" continued to let guests play as they like, Litgova and Halketam doing one-hour side after the other.
The Holta team would have been able to continue running in the final phase, but McGregors played well while setting up Jacobabs before Litgovs took the lead in the storm.
"Rangers" replacer Glens Midlton (Glenn Middleton) later requested another sentence after he had agreed with Jacobs, but Tomson's request was again ignored.
Almanahs: Geiger Calculator Deployer
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanah: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today... some day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelms "Hans" Geigers, who grew up as a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity as a result, finally, was a device known as Geiger's calculator.
In science, the writer of Geiger has also taken his place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (Cronados) where the main role was played by externally undisputed combat-type scientists Rodgers and Deils Evans:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger calculator used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you build these atoms, you can hear how atoms work, which are divided by this mineral's radioactive activity."
Evans says, "That's a real bird!"
"Hans" Geigers was named in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the destruction named in his name continues to exist.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them.
In the course of vaccine therapy, your immune system learns to identify bad cells
By using this method, immune cells are obtained from the patient, which are converted into the laboratory.
Then they could "see" protein that is characteristic of many harmful plants and will be injected back into the body.
The test vaccine shows multiple results in patients with various types of harmful plants.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect harmful cells experienced that her ovarian cancer had spread to more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient’s immune system cells, transform it into a laboratory to enable it to "increase" several plants with a specific HER2 protein and then to inject these cells back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute) at Bethesda (Bethesda), Maryland Professor Jay Berzovskis (Jay Berzofsky) said: "Our results show that we have a very multilingual vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of harmful crops," including breast, ovary, lungs and right and teeth, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach has been observed when the immune system cells that were "more likely" to attack the harmful plant cells have been affected by one type of leukaemia.
Kanje Vests after a visit to SNL, a trip in MAGA Cepura, attacked Trampa critics.
It's not gonna be okay.
Kanje Vests was graduated from the "Saturday Night Live" study this time after an inconsistencies in which he praised US President Donald Trampu and announced that he would be elected by the President for 2020.
At the end of the morning a third song, named "Gohost Town", during which he called the "Make America Great" cup, he began to read aloud phrases about democracies and repeatedly emphasized his support for Tramppa.
"So many times when I spoke to white people, they asked, "How can you like Tramps? He's a racist!"
Well, if I'd been attracted to racism, then I'd've known America before," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parade with Mett Demon (Matt Damon) in the main role where Hollywood stared the British Kaveno (Brett Kavanaugh) testimony to the Senate's Committee of Justice on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault.
Although it has not been overrun, material with Vesta's sad social networks was introduced by Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rox was trying to escape West like this.
And Vess was still complaining about the fact that he had been held in custody because of his head injury.
"They laughed at me in the ass!
They said, "They're not out there with their hats in their head."
They made me laugh!
And they also said I lost contact with reality," said West, according to the Washington Examiner.
The vest continued: "Gribat to see what happens when you lose ties with reality?" and promised to take "your Supermena cover," because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused at least two times the audiences, but the members of this team looked at themselves, and at least one person told the press issue: "The whole class was in the study."
The train was recently invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had met a friend of Max Miller (Mac Miller) some days earlier.
The garment was mixed with a sound (I Love it) that he performed in the champagne bottle.
News supported the conservative group leader TPUSA, Kandance Tenner (Candace Turner), who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most powerful people: PATEICS, WHAT DO YOU THINK!"
But I'm talking about this leader Karen Hanter (Karen Hunter) on the website Twitter wrote that West was just "what he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I will choose not to hire a person (to buy his music or clothing, or to support his "mature"), which, as I think, supports and contends with a ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she says.
Before this visit on Twitter, Twitter reported that he has changed his name, saying that now it has become "a being that has previously known as Kanji Vest".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and he acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another former Snoop Dogg was Snoop Lion, and, of course, the music legend Prince, changed his name with a symbol, but then to "a contemporary artist who used to be known as Prince".
Indicted complaint in an attempt to commit fraud in the Belfesta restaurant
A 45 - year - old man has been accused of attempted rape after he was beaten on Friday at the restaurant in East Belfast.
The police reported that the incident took place in the Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the Court of Justice of Belfast tomorrow.
Public Prosecution Service will be examined.
Kits Herrington's star towards toxicity
Kitt Herrington is known as the dragon-fucking John Snovs HBO in the tragic middle of the fantasy series "Tronj's Games".
However, 31 - year - olds have been opposed to a brutal war stereotype, saying that such a personal display often makes young children think they should be strong enough to be respected.
In a discussion with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kitt explained that she was going to be "a happy problem", and asked how to end up with toxicity in #MeToo.
Another who recently discussed with his "Tronn Games" partner, Rose Leslie, also aged 31, recognizes that this problem is important to him.
"I can't think right now about what mistakes we've made with men," he said.
"What do we new men learn about this problem when they grow up, taking into account the current problem?"
Another believes that television with its very male characters is partly responsible for the increase in toxicity.
He continued, "What is born, but what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young children feel that they need to be treated as men?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time: How can we change it?
Because with new men there are obviously problems."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any "Tron's games" on the follow-up or adventure, after the series ended next summer, stressing that "we have stopped the fields of terror and irony".
Starting with November, Kitts played a major role in the renewed Sema Sheparda "True West", which is the story of the film producer and his brother's winner.
The actor recently realized that he and his wife, Rose, considered the best thing that happened to them as a result of the "Tronn Games".
"I met my wife in this shop, since it in its own way provided for my current family and my life from that moment to time," he said.
Rosa Emmy's prized fantasy series played the second character of John Snova in love with Igritti.
In June 2018, the family of the Leslijas settled in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Health care officials report that more than 820,000 people are injured in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sex abuse, which showed changes.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased almost to zero, the health authorities of China were informed at the conference in the province of June.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that the discrimination against LGBT people is often compounded.
In view of the national conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up with women.
Many of the cases of transmissible transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are not sufficiently protected by the result of these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised general availability of HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Votersa prohibits that the employee has distorted the data of the Republican senators, but has turned against the "problems" and "revealing theories"
The United States Chamber of Representatives of the Maxine Votersa (Maxine Waters) rejected claims on Saturday that her staff member has published personal information on three United States senators' websites in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that claims were spread by the "ultra good" news and websites.
"Melie, honey and even more innocent honey," said Voters on his website.
The information is reported to include live addresses and phone numbers belonging to the United States Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orinam Hečam (Orrin Hatch) from Juts.
The information was published online on Thursday by an unknown person from Congress, while the Senate group heard a complaint against British Kaveno, the Supreme Court, on sexual misconduct.
The Flood occurred some time after the three senators appeared in Kaveno.
Conservative, internet sites, such as "Getway Pundit" and "RedState" reported that the source of the entries in the IP address is connected to the Voter's office, and revealed information about Voter's staff, informed Hills.
"This unfounded statement is absolutely false and totally evil!" said Voters.
"My staff staff member whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of this false and unjust claim is not in any way responsible for the dissemination of information.
This baseless statement is absolutely false and totally evil!"
Voter's announcement soon triggered criticism on the Internet, including the criticism of our former White Secretary, Ari Fleischer (Ari Fleischer).
"It's a cold ban," Fleishers wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her tempers do not match the members of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be vindictive.
He can't be a soldier.
He can't say the motive of the prosecutor.
He must be peaceful and united."
The task of Fleiser was to compare Voter's reaction to the democratic crisis of Judge Kaveno, who accused him of being too upset during the fourth day of hearing.
Omárs Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate, who in order to find that Voters lost his wish for a cross-sectional movement, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Votersa informed that her office had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these criminal statements.
"We will ensure that the enemy will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be recognized as legally responsible for all their work that is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
John's English 3 reference — Rovana Atkinsona's semi-responsible film exhibition
There has been an attempt to seek association with Breksiti in every new film with British bird, and this seems to apply also to what has happened, the French comedy of Johny English, which started with "Johnie England" in 2003 and the bird's return in 2011 with "John's English returns".
Is it foolish for us to think of ourselves as being as honest as we are? Is there a new chance of export for our fate?
In any case, imperfect John Anglim with his blind eyes and unusually moving face has the right to create tears after the second resurrection — his name is more than any other sign that he is a wide spectrum commissioner who has been developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He, of course, is a foolish secret agent, who, in the fight against his divine claims on the burning humiliation, is a little Kluzo, little Mr. Bín, and a girl who plays a part of the "Chariots of Fire" theme at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, undisputed personality that Atkinson once painted in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left the chaos on his way.
There are at least one or two powerful moments in John’s recent experience.
I found a place where John English is going to the helicopter's mid-computer in the middle of a gunfight, and the propeller's men are staring at his horse.
Atkinson's performance is visually visible, but humor is quite weak and deceptive, especially because "hard" film marks, such as "007" and "Inadequate Mission" use comedy itself with confidence, as one of the ingredients.
Humor's makes an impression that it has been entrusted to children rather than adults, and I think John Angel's absurd letters are not as creative and objective as the Atkinson's movie tricks in Bina's house.
As is usually the case, it is based on the fact that Britain has reached a serious crisis.
Kiberhakaris has entered the UK's super secret press internet, revealing the identity of the British agents in all these areas as an infamous active agent — the sad role of a small Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last salmon for the prime minister, for the pomposa and for the face of the conflict, who have already lost completely political popularity: Emma Tomsone does what he can, with Tereza Meja, partly like people, but the scenario does not have much to work with.
Her consultants are informed in the field of observation that, since all the active pressures have already occurred in the open, she will have to inform someone already retired.
And this man is John English, who is now working as a teacher in a poor educational institution, and we learn how to work as a blind agent (a couple of sensitive jockeys), for England offers to acquire a speech profession from the very foundations.
The English is returned to the Vatican's extraordinary meeting and is joined by his former many wounded assistant Bo, as well as currently playing Bens Millers (Ben Miller).
Because now there is a man who has been trained by the underwater commanders, a sensitive person who becomes important only at the end of the film — a part that is not fully used by Vicki Pepperdine.
And it comes from Betmen with Robin's great mistake of serving in His Highness Secret Service has returned and met the beautiful legitimate woman, Olga Kurylenko (Ophelia Bulletin).
As long as the prime minister is dangerously surrounded by the charismatic billionaire, poor Jason Volta, who is represented by Jake Lacy (Jake Lacy), and he claims that he is able to solve the UK computer chain.
England and Bo start their foresty taste: masked as officers, they borrow a small French restaurant; they create a feeling of loneliness by entering the corner of the Volta luxury; and England causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual reality on the head screen to meet the interior of the Volta building.
All possible end-of-life is done, but, as attractive and attractive as a movie, there are many children's television elements.
A multi-dimensional element.
Like other John's English film, I can't imagine if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would fully take advantage of his talent?
The Liberal Party prohibits plans for Brittany to work for four days a week, but the wage will be five days
Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn) is preparing to discuss a radical plan by which the British will work for four days a week, but the wages will be five.
It is reported that the party wishes that the managers of companies, with the help of an artificial intellectual revolution, be given to the workers, to open them another day.
In such a case, employees will be able to enjoy three days of a week’s wages while receiving the same amount of wages as before.
The author says that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy and plans to change the economy for the good workers.
Over four working weeks have been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One of the senior representatives of the Liberal Party informed "The Sunday Times": "It is expected that changes in politics will be reported by the end of this year.
"This won't happen one day, but four days' work week is an idea that meets the party's objective of balancing the economy for the good workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in the industry."
The Liberal Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party will introduce a solidarity in the 2017 general election campaign for four working days.
However, the welfare party does not currently support this letter.
The representative of the Liberal Party informed: "The four-day working week is not included in the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
Prime Minister John McDonnell used a liberal conference last week to give his views on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonela explained that he was committed to withdrawing power from the Directors' Mass and the public service company "experts".
The plan of the Minister of the Athens Cabinet also means that existing middle-party shareholders in the water companies will not be able to recover all their packages, as the welfare government could implement the "recovery" due to the alleged injustice.
He also approved plans to include working companies in the management of the company and to establish an exclusive own- rights fund (Onnership Fund) in order to allocate 10% of private-sector companies to staff who would receive up to 500 awards each year.
Lindsijs Grems and John Kenedijs answer "60 Minutes", or the FBI's investigation in Kaveno's case could change their views
The investigation by the FBI of a complaint against Judge Bret Kaveno (Bret Kavanaugh) has stopped the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could allow a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
During the interview, the “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelly (Scott Pelley) asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kenedius left a more open impression than his fellow colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," answered the Canadian.
"I said, pointing to the hearing procedure, I said I spoke to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the complaint became known, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was committed, direct and incomprehensible."
However, the vote of the Grema seems to be on the stones.
"I have made a decision on Bret Kaveno, and there will be a grueling complaint," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know, wait what: Bret strongly denied it," said Grems, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names were able to approve it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't think there are any changes to be expected."
What is the World’s Citizens’ Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be held in New York City, the annual musical event involving a impressive number of stars, with the same impressive mission: reducing poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festivals will visit tens of thousands of people who will be gathered in the Central Park in the Great Wall not only to enjoy the advantages such as Janet Jackson, Reperer Kardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendesa (Shawn Mendes), but also to increase understanding of the real objective of the measure, which is the final end of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a measure that has been established by the Global Power Project, which aims to end poverty by bringing more and more people to the fight against poverty.
In order to receive free tickets to this measure (if it was not intended to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a variety of tasks or "work", such as voluntary work, e-mailing a world leader, telephone calls or other important activities to promote understanding of poverty eradication.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been in achieving its goal for 12 more years?
Is the idea of awarding free concert is a good way to convince people to act, or is there just another case called "clipticism" when people seem to be able to really influence what they are doing by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "operation" from its supporters, trying to achieve various objectives.
It informs that these activities have helped world leaders to report commitments and policies equivalent to US$ 37 billion, which will affect more than 2.25 billion lives by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities for which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group concludes that the funds thus far have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership for investors and implementing partners in the United Kingdom, which has agreed to "help children to grow up fully," to provide Rwanda with $35 million in order to help end the country's poor food after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from citizens around the world.
"With the United Kingdom governments, donors, other national governments and citizens of the world like you support, we can leave a lack of social injustice in history," said the representative of Tracy Ulmen, the representative of the "The Power of Nutrition" in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5000 measures had been launched, calling on the United Kingdom Government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the Government announced that funding would be allocated to the "Power of Nutrition" project, which would provide food for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end the ultimate poverty?"
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long way in which we will fall short and suffer failure.
However, just as it has been achieved in large civil rights and anti-partite movements before us, we will also succeed, as we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson (Janet Jackson), the Weekend, Shoons Mendes (Shawn Mendes), Cardi B, Janella Monée (Janelle Monée) are some of the artists who will take up this year's event in New York, headed by Deborah-Lie Fernes (Deborra-Lee Furness) and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. military fleets could be used for "blockage" to stop Russian energy exports – Minister of Interior
"In case of need" Washington, Washington, U.S. Interior Minister Raiens Zinke (Ryan Zinke), said that it is called "Washington Examiner".
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, particularly in areas where it operates under the legal call of the government, are being undertaken to investigate the new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the staff, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its war fleet, can be prepared to open the sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had begun to visit the action taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization called itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared the approach of Washington to the solution to the situation in Russia and Iran, indicating that it is actually the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent solely on fossil fuels.
It is further claimed that the Trampa administration contributes to the export of frozen natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia with the most expensive options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, officials of the Trappa administration, as well as U.S. President Donald Tramps, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 gas management project that would make Berlin "dependable" in the name of Trampa.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that 11 billion US dollars worth of North Stream 2 gas management, which would double the current gas power to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that the hot opposition project in Washington is simply based on economic reasons and is a poor example of competition.
"In my view, we are convinced that energy cannot be a pressure-free tool and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Novaks after a September meeting in Moscow with US Minister for Energy Riku Perio.
The United States has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project once again.
The German leading industry organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from participating in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a big problem if a third country enters our energy reserve," said Mr. Dieter Kempfs, director of the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia after a recent meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Vorena will seriously consider her candidate for the 2020 presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Vorena announced that it was serious to apply to the president's meeting after the mid-term elections.
During the Council meeting in Holioka, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that the president's election was being considered.
"There is a real time for women in Washington to have a "salabo" imperfect government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in The Hill magazine.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidate's election to the President of the United States."
During the Council meeting, Vorena referred to President Donaldu Trampu, saying that he "leads this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Tramps is doing with our democracy," she said.
Vorena has openly criticized Tramp and her selected High Court candidate, Bret Kaveno.
Friday's Twitter report said: "Of course, the FBI's investigation is needed before the elections."
However, in the fourth round of the debate, the majority of Vorenas' supporters did not consider it appropriate to apply for the 2020 elections.
According to the results of the Boston Globe Political Research Centre/Time magazine of the University of Sufolas, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" voters claimed that Senators should not apply for an election.
Thirty-two per cent supported this decision.
The findings revealed that more support had been found by former Governor Devals Patrick, receiving 38 per cent of the candidate and 48 per cent against.
With regard to the possible candidate election of 2020, the names of the members of the High profile of the Democratic Party as former Vice-President Joe Baidens and Vermont Senator Bérnijs Sanderss will be shown.
The news agency "Associated Press" informed that Badens had agreed to make an official decision by January.
Sarah Peilina in another Treka Peillina PTSS Donalda Trampa
Treks Peilins (26) spent the year in Iraq after his arrest in September.
The first night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he is going through after his return, I can refer to other families that are related to PTSS effects and to certain doses of vulnerability that our soldiers return," she said to the public at Donalda Trampa in the morning of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilina called her arrest "the obvious problem that everyone sees" and said about her son and other war veterans that "they return a little differently, they return to their homes, they have returned to think about whether they are respected for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done to this country."
According to the representative of the Department of Police of Vasili, Dana Beneta was arrested on the first day in Vasili, Alaska, and charged with violence against the family in respect of women and the possession of weapons, while in a state of need.
18 states, Colombia's area with a challenge for new asylum policy
Eightty states and the Colombian region are supporting a legal challenge for a new US policy that deals with asylum seekers fleeing from the gang or violence.
The representatives of these 18 states and Colombia's districts presented a brief statement to the judge in Washington on Friday to support the asylum seeker who will face the obstacles created by that policy, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the petitioner, Grace v. Session, which was launched by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, is not open.
She claimed that her partner "and the son of her gang member" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The legal lawyers who supported Greece described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which came from the United States asylum seekers, such as countries where the problem was widespread in the family of temptation and violence.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeal Board, which allowed non-documented immigrants who fled from the family of violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, General Prosecutor of the Colombia Region, Karl Racín announced that the new policy "agnorates national, federal and international laws introduced to the decodes".
"Federal law provides that all requests for asylum are considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the request, and such a breach violates this principle," said the judge in a brief statement.
In addition, a lawyer stated in his statement that a policy that allows immigrants to enter the country would damage the US economy, as these immigrants would most likely become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Seschens (Jeff Sessions) turned to immigration judges asking that they no longer grant asylum to victims who fled from the family of violence and gangs.
"Avoid is available to people who have lost their family due to persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Seschens said in his statement on politics on 11 June.
The commitment has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
An excellent rescue attempt by Palu to double the number of survivors in the search process
The situation in the survivors has become even worse.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Ríza Kusuma, calming his little drunk in the center of the city of Palu's evacation.
"In a few minutes, the medical assistance service will introduce new victims.
The water is weak."
The people were visible, returning to their destroyed homes and relieving the wasteland of the water, trying to save everything that was found.
Seven people were vaccinated, and patients suffering from 7.5 magnitudes of severe earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Haris (Dwi Haris), who had been diagnosed with migraine and fever, slept outside of the Palu military hospital, where patients were cared for outside because of a severe post-Greed.
His eyes were filled with tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to strike down the number of hotels in the fifth place where he met with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
Apparently, I was stuck in the wall hole," the news agency "Associated Press" told Haris, pointing out that his family had entered the city for the sake of the streets.
"I called my wife for help, but then a crowd entered.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of attempting to arrest it by advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came to the audience with four pages of advertising, every day highlighting the benefits of the US and China trade, the US ambassador in China accused the use of Beijing's American press to spread the propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Tramps referred to the annex paid to China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register, accusing China of attempting to enter the United States Congress on 6 November, but China prohibits it.
Trampa's claim that Pekina's attempt to enter the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told the Reuters agency that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is absolutely normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasing trade war, as a result they are applying a number of tariffs to imports of each other.
In the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in countries such as Aio, which supported the party of the Trapa Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terius Branstads, a US messenger in China and former former governor of the Aiota, who is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Pekina has suffered from American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstads wrote his opinion on Sunday's issue "Des Moines Register", saying that China "now doubles this arrest by introducing advertising ads at our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses such a significant tradition of freedom of speech and free press for America by introducing a paid advertising "Des Moines Register," wrote Branstads.
"In contrast here, the ordinary Beijing news will find a limited number of opinions and will not see such a different real reflection that China's people can have with regard to the disturbing economic trajectory of China, given that the media are here in strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most influential journals refused to publish" his work, but he did not mention what it was.
Analyticals warn of the Republicans who withdraw the ranks of female voters from the midterm elections involving the Kaveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court's candidate, Bret Kaveno (Bret Kavanaugh), against which several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that they will face a negative reaction, particularly by women.
Related emotions have been extremely high, and most Republicans are already ready to vote.
Such things can't be said, "The Hill written in the journal "The Hill" by Professor Grant Reeher of Science at the University of Moscow's School of Political Sciences.
Mr Ríhers suspects that Senator Jeff Fleika (Jeff Flake) (R-Arizona)'s recent incentive to conduct the FIB investigation will be a very great reason to attract the warm voters.
"She will never forget what happened last night. She will not forget it tomorrow or November," she said, according to the magazine "Washington, D.C." on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre (Karine Jean-Pierre) said: "MiveOn" was a progressive move by the former councillor and the state representative.
On Friday morning, protestors in Senate's front demonstration called "Novembers came!" when the Republicans, under whose supervision the Committee of Justice, chose to continue with the opening of Kaveno's candidate for Dr. Christine Blasey Fordas (Dr. Christine Blasey Ford), reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," political analyst Styū Rotenberg (Stu Rothenberg) wrote to the Portal.
"People say it's already high, it's fair.
However, it could be even higher, especially among the most controversial voters and the most recent voters (aged 18 to 29), who often do not wish even if the president does not like them."
Even before the Forda's public testimony in which he made allegations of sexual violence by the Supreme Court's Supreme Court candidate, the analysis of the possible failure of the Republicans to continue to make this candidate.
"This Republican Party has become an exciting chaos," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republic, at the beginning of the last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Kaveno will be tried, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they've been held against it," said the news channel Guy Sesil (Guy Cecil) — The President of the United States, who runs this group that helps to choose democracy.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little divided into what they believe in after Forda and Kaveno's testimony, a little bit more to believe in the latest.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 per cent claim that they believe in Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent claimed that Kaveno may have benefited from his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian newspaper reported that the FBI is currently conducting an investigation on Forda's allegations and on at least one other complainant — Debor Ramirez (Deborah Ramirez).
Last week, Forda witnessed in the Senate's Committee of Justice that he had committed sexual assault on him at 17 years of age.
Ramirez argues that during his studies in Jeilla in 1980, the Supreme Court’s candidate showed him his generality.
Global web developer plans to start a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Bärners-Lī (Tim Berners-Lee), a global web developer, starts a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project "Inrupt" in technology legend is a company based on the first code platform "Solid" opened in Bärnsa-Lì.
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and what people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with "Fest Company", Bärnerss-Lì argued that "Inrupt" is "dominating over the world".
"We have to do this now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The user uses "Solid" technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or PTD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It is the same as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in one search.
The personal online database is unique because only the user determines what and what kind of information can be accessed.
It is referred to as "personal powers using data".
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make solid available to everyone.
The company is currently operating in Bärners-Lì, Bröss, IBM's security platform, some of the doctors who are engaged in the project, and a voluntary co-coder community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bärnerss-Lie said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes, completely covering all their business models in one night.
"We don't ask for his permission."
The Platform "Media" published in Bärners-Lī said that "Inrupt" "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network based on "Solid".
In 1994, Bärners-Lì was transformed into the Internet by establishing a Global Network Consortium at the Masaçussets Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Bärnersam-Lì has had an impact on the discussions on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the "Inrupt" launch, Bärners-Lì will remain the founder and director of the Global Network Consortium, the Global Network Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new site," Bürners-Lì added.
Bernard Vens (Bernard Vann): Note of the Victoria Cross awarded to the World War I
For the past 100 years, the city of his birth has been marked by the fact that the only English Bazníica driver has received Victoria’s cross during World War I as a warrior.
On 29 September 1918, in connection with the attack on Bellengles and Lehaukorta, the eligible vice-president, Bernard Vens received this appeal.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a gunman, so he also did not know of the British highest military award.
On Saturdays in Rašden, Northamptonshire, her two little pieces of memory were revealed to her.
One of her little ones, Michael Vann, said that it was "symbolic" that such stone was discovered 100 years after his father had received a significant award.
According to the newspaper London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vens led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin "with a very heavy and heavy-duty-stricken and large-scale fires created by the great fires."
He then stepped on the shooting line and, with the utmost caution, led this line forward before the introduction of the large-scale zone, where he won three groups.
On October 4, 1918, the Polish president, Vanu, killed the German army — just a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Venus (72) said that his father's action was "something I could never do, and that is also a very humble act".
He, along with Dr. James Vann (Dr. James Vann), also died in the case of the enemy Orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens said that he felt "thank you, sharing in this debt," and added that "the value of the true prize shows the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night for "Belletor 206", but instead waited for Cúcinju Pepu
Imagine having been up all night to see Belletor 206, but at the end of this main event, you are tired.
In Sanhos, 13 battles were fought, including six of the main cards, which were transferred to the United Kingdom’s 5th channel at the end of the night.
At 6 p.m. from the morning when Gegards Musasi (Gegard Mousasi) and Rory MacDonalds (Rory MacDonald) were preparing to stand up against each other, the observers in the United Kingdom were not pleased to move the transmission to the Puciju Pepa.
Some were really confused when all night long until early in the morning, they were still in a state of shock, waiting for war.
Some fans on the website Twitter described a change in transmission to children's multiple films as "ineffective none".
"The government has determined that after 6.00 p.m. the content of this type is not acceptable, so there has been the closure of the broadcast on the children's programme," Deivs Schwartz (Dave Schwartz), the senior vice-president on marketing and communication issues.
"Church Pepa," "yes."
The president of the "Bellator" company Scott Kokers (Scott Cooker) said he was working on the schedule so that viewers in the United Kingdom could see these broadcasts.
"When we think about re-examination, I think, we can do something to solve it," Kokers said.
"But the clock is there six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and the first day after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts were displayed after the transfer was closed, and they were not positive.
We tried to avoid it because we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't that, the government controlled it.
I can assure you that there will be no such problem next time.
We're going to hold on to five wars, not six (as it has been so far). We're trying to confirm the fans, but we're going to get a percentage.
This is an unfortunate situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Toms Share Unfeeling Enough for His Sexuality
The Olympics, Tom Daley (Tom Daley), claim that he grew up to feel more worthless than others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to make progress.
The 24-year-old man didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started visiting high school.
In his first radio program "Desert Island Discs", led by Lorena Laverne (Lauren Laverne), he said he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "the truth".
He also said that becoming a parent would make him less tired of winning in the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term programme, Kirsty Janga (Kirsty Young), has been given for several months due to the disease.
In the first programme of the Lavernes, Delijs said that increasing feeling "better" than others, because "in society it is not accepted that both girls and children can be trusted".
He said, "Even today it feels like I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, was the main engine that gave me the strength and endurance to achieve the results."
He said that you wanted to prove that there's "something" so that I wouldn't let people think when they finally knew about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal player has become the leader of a high-level LGBT campaign and has used his appearance in this year's Games in Australia, calling for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that we decided to talk to the public, because he was happy that he was able to live openly and without difficulties, and wanted to give the truth to others.
Three times the world champion said that in a man's love, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who was hit by a "no-preparation" in 2013.
Delicate 20 years ago, Oskar’s prize laureates last year claimed that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much" (his first Olympic games were 14 years old, and his father died three years later), it's hard to find someone in your age who would have lived in similar heights and curves.
Paris became Robert Rays Blacks-Dellijs (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Delilius claimed that his "all perspectives" had changed.
"Before the year, everything that was important to me was the acquisition of gold medals," he said.
"You know what? Life is more important about Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
He said that his father did not want to accept his death, and one of the last things he had to do with Deili was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games, where he wanted to find out in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she won't be found in the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not capable," he said.
In the following year, Deilis participated in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won a bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – entering the house in front of the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of music — Heather Small, a "Proud" performed by Heather Small, which was based on his success in the Olympics and still up-to-date Zossade.
The "Desert Island Discs" program is listening to BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15 p.m. after the British summer time.
From the form of Michaelson's reserve line on the sixth day of Raider's cause
American Phil Mikelson (Phil Mickelson) will set up a record on Sunday playing his 47th. Raider's game board, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed event.
Michaelson, who had already participated 12 times every two years in the campaign, sat at the reserve for four bombs and two pairs of games on Saturdays.
Instead of finding a center of activity as often as it was in relation to US troops, the winning winner divided his day, both acting as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of improving what he was given.
As the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most precise player in his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for fighting in an unfathomable "Le Golf National" field where he is regularly being punished by the wrong side.
And, if the game itself is not exciting enough, Michaelson's nineth birthday will fight with the winner of a precise British champion, Frankesco Molinari, who has joined forces with young Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood) to win all four games this week.
If the Americans remaining with four points starting with 12 single slots successfully run, Michaelson's team could show a decisive role.
Furik, without saying a few words, expressed confidence in his teammate.
"He fully recognized his role today, called me by the mouse, applied his hand to me and said that tomorrow he would be ready," said Furik.
"He's very confident about himself.
He's an excellent sportsman who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I've ever seen him play two games.
I pictured more, but everything was wrong, and that's what we're counting on.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will take the record of Nika Faldo (Nick Faldo) with the most played eyes on the Raider cause on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the race of Raider's cause, which it has never really met with its individual record heights.
Michaelson has won 18 victories, experienced 20 losses and seven undisputed games, although Furik has also claimed that his presence has given the team knowledge of the benefits of the non-material nature.
"He's a nice, warm and intelligent person, he likes to get excited about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the latest players were also going to go around this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just the game."
European election captain Thomas Björn (Thomas Bjorn) knows that a significant turnout can be achieved as soon as possible
European election captain Thomas Bjorns, from experience, knows that in the course of an important turnout, in fighting for Raider's cause in the last few days, it can be easy to turn into an unpleasant situation.
Danis held a debate in the 1997 game in Valderram, where the opposition commander’s commander’s team, Sívs Baljesteros (Sieve Ballesteros), won five points over the Americans, but only now has reached the final line with a very few points, i.e., beat with 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You will continue to remind yourself that we had a great deal of leadership in Valderra; we had a leadership in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderra, where we had won but only with a small surplus," said Bjorns (the picture), looking at the 2018 release team's victory with 5-3 both Thursday and evening, to run with 10-6 golfers in the field "Le Golf National.
So the story will show both me and any member of its team that there is no end.
In the morning, you'll get it all back.
Give in the field and show your best performance!
This will not be done until the items obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to get this trophie and concentrate on it as well.
I've always said that I focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very well aware of what happens to us on the other hand -- the world's top players."
eased by what the players showed in the golf course, Bjorns added: "I never complained about the sword.
The morning is waiting for new challenges.
Tomorrow is intended for individual games, and it's quite another thing.
It's great, if you're late when everything is going well, you're a partner with you, but individual games are fully tested by your golfer skills.
This message must be sent to your players, i.e. to bring back everything to themselves in the next day.
Now you leave your partner, and he should also be able to show his best gift."
Unlike Bjorn's opponent team, Captain James Furiks will wish his players to show their best performance directly in individual non-partner games. The exception is just Jordan Spitt (Jordan Spieth) and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who won three points from the four.
At the same time, Furics has defeated both of these important last days tournaments — both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a result of the European team's winning a sensory achievement, which later became known as the "Miracle at Medinah" in the golf world.
"Atceros every word," he said, responding to the fact that Bens Krenšo (Ben Crenshaw), head of the 1999 team, joined his players in the last day's battle.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to a quick show to live in Brooklyn, where you lived in Medin.
When such an impulse is generated in one direction, it creates a great pressure for medium-sized games.
We have developed our composition, and we have dealt with the guys in a way that we were right, and we're trying to make some noise tomorrow."
Tomasam had been assigned to try to control the strike, and he had introduced Rory McIllroy to the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rousu (Justin Rose), John Rome (John Rahm), Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter).
"I've met the guys in this sequence because, I think, it's the best part during the tournament," Bjorns said about selected players.
Resend of the new German cart transfer in operation
Germany’s latest frigate had to be handed over to the operation in 2014, thus replacing old wartime karates in August, but it will not be achieved until the next year due to the system of error and increasing costs, it reported local media.
The transfer of the main "Rheinland-Pfalz" class of the Baden-Virtemberg frigate class is now suspended until the first half of 2019, reported in the journal "Die Zeit", referring to military field representatives.
The ship had to join the car fleet in 2014, but the unfavourable supply problems affected the wheel of the ambitious project.
The four Bádenes-Virtembergs class ships, which were ordered by the karaflot in 2007, are replaced by the old Bremen class frigates.
It is expected that it will be equipped with powerful large-scale, large-scale anti-air and anti-ships rockets, as well as some secret technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential characteristics include longer periods of storage — new frigates must be available for up to two years of prom from the ports in which they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the latest technology wars, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its powers in the overseas countries, will already be advanced until the time of its entry into operation, says "Die Zeit".
In the past year, an unsuccessful frigate F125 was thought to have all the headlines when the German car fleet officially refused to carry ships into operation and sent them back to the ship's builder "Blohm & Voss" Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship's cargo was returned to the ship's builder.
It was little known about the reasons for such a step, but the German media referred to several significant "software and equipment defects" that would make warships useless if used in the military mission.
The programme deficit was a particularly important factor, since the Bádenes-Virtemberg class ships were operating around 120 large crews, only half of the former Bremen class frigate staff.
It has also been shown that the ship has too much weight to reduce its performance and limit its ability to make improvements in the future.
It is considered that 7000 tonnes of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany during World War II.
Similarly, the cost of the entire project (including service training) to the wrong device has also become a major problem.
It is estimated that its costs have reached EUR 3.1 billion in the originally planned EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the new frigates will become particularly important, taking into account recent warnings that the German maritime forces will be reduced.
At the beginning of this year Hans-Pitters Bartels (Hans-Peter Bartels), the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee acknowledges that the car fleet is actually "beginning the ship to be used".
The Amatperson claimed that in time this problem has been very similar, as old ships are removed from operation but are not delivered to new ones instead.
He regretted that none of the Bádenes-Virtemberg's frigates had joined the Carflot.
"National Trust" listened to the life of a blind couple.
A new study carried out in an area of Scotland's height is aimed at discovering how the syllables are used in the food search process.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying gears and will help them in future protection measures.
Scottish "National Trust" scientists in the Inverveves garden in Westeros will study pulsifiers, pigments, as well as brown gorillas and water tankers.
In particular, special recorders will be set up to monitor sequential activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all entries to determine the frequency of the successful calls and those of the species performing specific actions.
A biotopes map and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape view reflecting the behavior of the sexes.
NTS Natural Protection Council Robs Devars (Rob Dewar) expects the results of which biotopes are the most important and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biofuel management activities such as the creation of forests and how to best keep forests and other related species.
During the last century, the population of whites in Scotland and the United Kingdom has been greatly affected.
These countries are at risk of building and development, which is responsible for the loss of asylum and residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, such as mushpapers and some construction materials, as well as catalytic attacks.
In fact, the kisses are not accelerate.
However, because of their suddenness of hunger, their ears are more useful than their eyes during their hunger.
They use a complex method of determining the location of the support location to find the holes and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
NTS, responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is seriously seriously affected by the problem of skirmish.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, audits and sometimes even rescue works.
The organisation has even set up a reservation for the first and only special season in Scotland, especially in Damfresia and Galove, where eight of the species encountered in Scotland will die.
Special Manager David Thompson (David Thompson) says that this territory is ideal for successful farmers.
"Here's a great place for the sexes," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
But there are still many things we don't know about success, so the work we do here and in other things will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He points out that it is important to check whether, prior to the maintenance of the property, it is important to check whether the survivors in the area concerned may not be killed because of the unknown destruction of one mother's secretaries, including 400 mothers and their infants, and thus possibly the destruction of all the local population.
Sexual predators are protected animals, and they must not kill, hurt, hurt, or destroy their secrets.
The Scottish Conservation Trust staff Elizabeth Ferrela (Elizabeth Ferrell) has called on the company to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about the sexes, and for many species we just don't know how to dress them."
Ronaldo hates the prosecution by ordering lawyers to appeal to the German newspaper of Germany
Christian Ronaldo (Cristiano Ronaldo) has ordered against his alleged accusation as a "white news", claiming that people "will draw attention to themselves", using his name.
Her lawyers were ordered to appeal to the German press newspaper "Der Spiegel", which published these statements.
The Portuguese and the Turkish "Juventus" football team is accused of excavating American Kathryn Majorg (Kathryn Mayorga) in a number of Las Vegas hotels in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid $375,000 to a woman to hear about this incident on Friday, he sent "Der Spiegel".
A few hours after these statements were made, Ronalda, 33, with Instagram's online video interface, turned to its 142 million followers, calling this information "white stuff".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the camera sent a five-year-old "Ballon d'Or" award winner.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," smiles the added player.
According to the information provided by the Reuters, Ronalda lawyers are ready to submit to the court a Der Spiegel newspaper on the allegations they have called "unacceptable information in the area of private property".
Cristian Scherttz said that the player would ask for compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the crime which may be one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 at the "Palms Hotel and Casino" class in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted by the Supreme Court in Nevada, Clarka is reported to have returned to the player's hotel number, where he had an Annaly beat the woman at the night club.
Majorga claims that after that incident, Ronald's crisis is on the way and said there's a "99 per cent "very good"" but a crisis in this "one percent" claim.
According to the information provided in the document, Ronalda confirmed that there were sexes in the past, but this occurred after the bilateral agreement.
Majorga also claims to have taken pictures of the trauma she had received at the hospital, but later she agreed to the extrajudicial agreement because she felt "broads from the conduct" and was disturbed by "public degradation".
A 34 - year - old woman claims that she no longer wants to agree with the terms of the agreement because the incident has left the trauma to remain.
At the time of the above claims, Ronaldo was moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this evening he moved 100 million euros to Italy's great "Juventus".
Brexit: The loss of the United Kingdom's "for all time sorry" producers
"The United Kingdom "will regret it all the time" if it will lose its world leader position in the production of cars after Brexit," said business secretary Greg Clarks.
Its "increased" fact that Toyota UK has announced "BBC" that, if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production from the existing Burnaston plant in Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clarka.
The Japanese author said that the delay in the border with Breksita could be made to the workplace without agreement.
In the past year, the Burnaston industry producing "Toyota" models "Auris" and "Avenis" produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production in our industry will be stopped," said the Director of Toyota in Burnstone Marvin Kuks (Marvin Cooke).
Other United Kingdom producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have been concerned about leaving the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, "BMW" claims that after Brexit a month, it will close its mini factory in Oxford.
According to the authors, the main concerns are the hazardous supply chain if no agreement is reached after Breksita.
The Toyota production line shall operate in accordance with the principle of "exquisite time" where vehicles manufactured after the order, every 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and EU suppliers, are required.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the EU on 29 March without agreement, there may be obstacles that could lead to delays and shortcomings.
After the company said "Toyota" it would not be possible to keep more than one day's valuable inventory in its Derbyshire factory, so it would be possible to stop production.
Mr Clarka said that the action plan (Chequers) drawn up by Teresa Meas (Theresa May) for future relations with the EU is "predicted to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that would allow me to say, not only to get good at the present time, but also to use this opportunity," he said "BBC" in Radio 4 programme "Today".
"The evidence of this is not only from Toyota, but also from other producers that we need to be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to state how long the production could be stopped, but it warned that the long-term costs would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris (Peter Tsouvallaris) who has been working in Burkina Faso for 24 years and working in the union industry as the coordinator of the union, said that her members feel a growing confusion: "From experience, I can say that as soon as someone else dies, it doesn't come back."
The representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
A trampa meeting with Rozenstein can be resumed, report to the Baltimore House
Donalda Trampa's important meeting with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rozenstein (Rod Rosenstein) can be "retired for another week" because of the fight with the Supreme Court's candidate, Brit Kaveno, he reported to the White House on Sunday.
Rozenschen has been monitoring the involvement of Special Adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who is investigating the entry of Russia into force, the link between the resources used by Trampa and Russia, and the possible non-compliance with the law by the President.
For months in Washington, Tramps will be questioned whether the general prosecutor's website will be released and will thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, "New York Times" reported that Rozenstein has discussed the signing of the negotiations with Trampu and the possibility of reintroducing the President with Amendment 25.
Rozenstein denied this information.
But on the last morning, he went to the White House, where he talked about his departure.
It was announced on Thursday with Trampu, who was present at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that "better" did not leave Rozenstein, but then the meeting was dismissed to avoid contact with the Senate hearing of both Kaveno and one of the women who accused her of sexual misconduct — Dr. Kristine Blesia Forda.
On Friday, Tramps told the FIB to conduct a week's investigation in connection with the charges raised by Kaveno, continuing to cancel the Senate's vote.
Trampa Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (Sarah Sanders) visited "Fox News Sunday".
In the presence of Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been laid down, it could have been left this week or left over for a week, taking into account all the matters that are taking place at the Supreme Court.
But we will see it, and I always want to inform the press about the young."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sandersa has not done our press release in White since 10 September.
The leader of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of free money was not related to the negative against the television reporter "favourous cowards," although she added, "I don't believe they are famous cowards."
He then proposed direct contact between Trampu as a result of increased press interest.
"The President took more questions and answers than any president before her," she said and, without further information, added, "We have been interested in the number."
Sandersa said that freeing will still happen, but, "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States the questions without interfering, it is unlikely that it is better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot, and you see we've done it a lot over the last few weeks, and it's going to happen at the press station when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramps regularly answers questions by issuing from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences that are visited by important persons.
The individual press conference is rare.
The President may have demonstrated his reasons this week in New York by using the uncontrollable and short-term statements of the rapporteur.
Letter from the Minister of Health to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS on threats related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a list of EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express thanks and to choose a stand after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the start of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of applying for permanent status to EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter to the United Kingdom and the EU, Frimena wrote: "All the time, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued to emerge, leading to the expected decisions this morning.
However, the United Kingdom Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement has been reached.
I know this is a very unpleasant time for you.
I would therefore once again like to emphasize how much I value the involvement of any staff member regardless of their nationality.
Members of both the EU and outside it offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care services and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we very much want to stay here."
An emergency operation is performed on behalf of the Christian Abercrombies
The state of Tigers protected by Kristen Abercrombie (Crission Abercrombie) was performed by an extraordinary operation after his head injury in a six-day game, resulting in a 31-27-year-old "Vanderbilt Commodores", reported by the sports reporter Mike Organ (Mike Organ).
The state team of Tennis told the reporters that tragedy occurred shortly before the half hour.
"He came to the side lines and said it was a noise," said Ryd.
As Abercrombies were found on the side lines, trainers and medical personnel gave him a glass of oxygen, and he got on the floor and bought it for further research.
A member of the state of Tennessee reported that Abercromby was involved in the Vanderbilta University Medical Center.
Haris adds that in the meantime "no information on the type of trauma/smood" and the Tenes State team is trying to understand where the tragedy is coming from.
Abercrombies, the Red Creak, is in its first season after the Ilonian replacement of the Tenese State Command.
Before the 6th day of the game, he had played five blocks in total, which was made up of 18 in this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher national tax by buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher national tax by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and the additional equipment obtained will be used to assist the homeless in accordance with the new "Tory" plan.
This step will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased national tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national cash scheme provides that up to 120 million allowances can be collected per year, aimed at providing assistance to homeless people.
A higher national tax will apply to foreign buyers by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and by drawing off the additional supplies received for aid to homeless people, which will today be notified by Tereza Meja.
This step is regarded as an attempt to neutralize the efforts of Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn) to attract new voters with an agreement to ensure houses at the most profitable prices and to talk about the most sustainable part of society.
The increased State duty will be applied to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money received to open up government efforts to tackle the problem of homeless people.
The aid included in the present State duty, including the application of a higher level fee imposed two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another house, could be three per cent.
The country’s crisis provides that such steps can be complemented by its budget up to 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built London property is purchased by non-residents, thus putting prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to go to their own house.
Many of the countries in possession, especially in the capital, have become "spocco cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) called for a reduction in public spending so that more new people could be allowed to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high non-smokers’ prices, depleting the land, but not using it, and encouraged Mejas to reject quotas for affordable housing in order to address the problem of British households.
Mr Corbin has proposed a number of attractive house reforms, including the reform of rent control and leave the house for no reason.
He also wants to give the councils greater authority for the construction of new houses.
Mrs Mejas said: "Last year I said that I would use my prime minister's position to restore the dream of Britain — that is, every new generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means setting up our registered home markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not true that houses can be purchased at the same time as foreign companies and persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, its hard workers in Britain.
Many dream of their home has become too far, and the problem of homeless people is still present."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run "Scottland"
"Sunderland" leader Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is to become a "Scottland" leader at some point.
Scott, 42, has faced the challenge of renewing the Northeast Club, which now takes the third place in the first agreement with three points from above.
He moved to "Stadium of Light" after the introduction of "St Mirren" back in Scotland's premier last season.
"As a player I wanted to play my country.
I got a B bag, and it was all, "Sportsound" said Ross to the Scottish "BBC" broadcast.
"But I grew up, with my father watching "Scotland" games in Hampden Park, and it has always invited me to go back.
However, such an opportunity will only be shown if I am successful in managing the club."
The leader of the Russian "Sunderland" club is Dick Advocate (Dick Advocate), David Moyes (David Moyes), Sam Allardis (Sam Allardice), Martin O'Neill (Martin O'Neill), Roy Kins (Roy Keane), Guss Poiet (Gus Poyt) and Paulo Di Canio (Paul Di Canio).
The former "Alloa Athletic" president claimed that he did not feel confused following such a large club leader at the end of the day, to reject the offers made by Barnsly and Ipswiča.
"My achievements will now be evaluated after I can return to this club in a preliminary manner.
Because of the structure and possibility of this club, it is no doubt premier," he said.
"Returning to the club is not a simple task, but, most likely, I will think that I will be here to see the results only when this task is done."
Ross is only three years in his career as a director for a period of time in Dumbarton and for a 15-month period in the "Hearts" trainer.
After that, he helped the Alloa club recover from the third grade and, in the same season, helped St. Mirren get the title of the champion.
Ross says he's now feeling much more comfortable than his player's career during the club "Clyde", "Hartplepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"These may have been true cross-cells," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa."
"I really believed that leadership was my real call – much more appropriate than playing.
He listened to me because I had good results, was able to live from it, and also to enjoy some of the known heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to eat a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of the stress and pressure associated with the work, but management is my destiny.
I always wanted to run, and now I do. It seems that I am in the right place, I don't feel so good all my life."
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Saturday, September 30, from 12.00 to 1 p.m. in British summer.
The summary shows that the most appropriate time to stop smoking is at 7:30 p.m.
The summer’s heat wave has allowed Britain’s less popular fear to rise, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The collected data revealed that in July the volume of beef and veal sales increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a representative of business consultancy agency CGA that collected data, said: "The continuous solar time and the participation in England's accession to the world's cause meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. the crop profit had increased by 2.8 per cent, while the restaurant had experienced a crisis.
Restaurants, which decreased by 1.8 per cent in June, suffered even worse in July.
The situation in the grapes and bars was more widespread because they lived in a much larger area than in the restaurants.
Food-based circles are also impressed by the sun, but not as dramatic as those of the restaurants.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go outside for a drink.
The production of alcohols and alcohols increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while the supply of food decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM's relaxed and hospitable analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue to show a remarkable trend at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of broad social or sport measures are major factors that determine the market for goods outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the Group of Restaurants continues to fight, although the sales crisis of 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year's period will be particularly painful for the pressure of additional unsustainable costs.
With regard to food suppliers in the spirit and heat of summer, it was not possible to reach even more than the necessary time, and the time will show whether the temperature we normally experience in August will provide such a much needed room."
The total sales increase in the crop and restaurants, including in the new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in the sales volume of brands.
"Coffer Peach Tracker" is the United Kingdom's sales supervisor, bar and restaurant sector, who collects and analyzes the data of 47 operational groups where the total turnover exceeds 9 billion stars, and this is a sectoral criterion.
Every fifth child has a blind social media account that hides it from his parents
It was discovered that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a blind social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey, involving 20,000 high school students, revealed a false increase in the Instagram page.
These reports have caused concern about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "main" account to show the parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, is forming social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In a survey involving 20,000 high school students, it was found that the number of false profiles was rapidly increasing in Instagram’s photo collection site.
These reports have caused concern about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "clean main" account to show the parents, and they also have private accounts.
One mother, who was 13 years old at the age of 13, discovered a bottle - gourd plant that encouraged others to throw her out.
In a study conducted by the Digital Awarenss UK and the Independent School Managers Conference (HMC), 40 per cent of 11-18-year-old students found that there were two profiles, and only half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Bukanans (Mike Buchanan) said: "It's frightening that so many teenagers make online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilida Doila will be "voice" in Scotland's Vieglatactic Board
At the annual meeting of the Board of Governors of Elida Doila (Eilh Doyle), the Council of Scotland was elected as Director-General without implementing powers.
Doila is Scotland's most popular room and doctoral facility, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those who pursue sports to use her extensive experience at international level over the past ten years.
"Eilida is deeply respected throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's light language community, and we are confident that Scotland will receive an extraordinary amount of flexibility by joining its government," said Beitijs.
Doila said: "I would like to work as a "swift voice" and hope that I can really get involved and help move this kind of sport in Scotland."
The American who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, thus in general the acquisition of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC Pandist, unable to follow the transitional extremes.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day I survived an stroke a month ago.
I couldn't sleep.
The doctor said that only time would show or how much longer I would stay.
It was a wonderful job, but I was completely relieved, learned to walk again, and today I can do business training!
Thank you for your encouraging words!"
The places are divided into a breast milk smoke advertising that compares mothers to cows
A hard milk smoke production company has prepared for shared views on the Internet on advertising in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to breastfeeding.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "first-class breast cancer" in the world, the consumer technology company "Elvie" released a mild advertising of mellitus to demonstrate the freedom that breast-feeding mothers have to offer a new cigarette.
Four real mother gave a piece of shit with a wall-full of shit at the door, and the words were about, "Yes, I listened to myself, but you didn't see any ass" and, "If you hadn't noticed, they weren't uncles, they're my chest."
The offer continues: "Send out, send out, I am carrying small children, I am sending, I am sending, I am listening to my dreams."
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has been called a wide range of rationalities online.
77 000 times, and hundreds of times, the commented video has received partial viewer reviews, and many claim that it emits "screams" in the milk industry.
"The very wrong decision to use good product advertising is wrong.
Just like us, they also need to get into trouble and dream, but their little ones are taken away a few days after their birth," one wrote.
Elvie's breast sugar is not included exclusively in breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that this is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The opinion was also expressed: "The authors did not know what to do."
Others protected the advertising, and some women admitted that, in her opinion, the noise was "sudden".
"I think it's an excellent idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still hungry.
I feel like I'm just like a bitch.
The advertising is a few pieces, but I understand its idea.
This is a great product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "There is a bitter advertising, thought to mothers who throw milk (in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "goves".
It is not a advertising that celebrates or places the milk industry."
At the end of the announcement, the group of women finds that they were all involved with unconquered smoke that was placed in their pockets.
The concept of campaigns is based on the observation that many women who take milk claim to feel like honey.
But the Elvie Pump is completely sound, it's not a guide and a driver, and it doesn't necessarily include women's swimming pool, allowing them to move freely, keep small and even participate in activities outside the house.
Anna Balarina (Ana Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump" is such a revolutionary product that it has won a courageous and provocative release on the market.
By drawing parallels between women who take milk and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the restoration of milk, while demonstrating in a clear and understandable way the feeling of freedom that will bring new rains."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has started at the center of attention.
In London Modes, two children’s mother appeared on the wrong view of Martha Jakubowski (Marta Jakubowski) using this product.
Seven migrant children's clubs moved to a remote city to the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased rapidly, although every month the border is crossing relatively as many people as before, and in part, it has been achieved in the framework of the Trampa administration, which has made it difficult to expel children from sponsors.
The majority of sponsors have also themselves been immigrants without documents, fearing that, openly claiming to take the child, it will endanger their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their households would have to be allowed to withdraw purchases, and these data would also be transmitted to other immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens (Matthew Albence) was the oldest official in the enforcement of immigration and customs laws prior to the convention, showing that the agency had arrested ten people who had been seeking sponsors for minors.
The Agency further confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons were not previously punished.
"Nearly 80 per cent of the people who are either sponsors or sponsors of the sponsors' households are illegal here, and most of these people are criminals.
That is why we continue to follow such people," said Mr Albensa.
According to the asylum officer, while trying to look at children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new provisions which stipulating that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days of the previous standard.
Many will take advantage of the opportunity to call the videoconference, but will not come personally to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons considered inappropriate for the acquisition of release will be promptly expelled.
As children are kept in custody longer, the greater possibility that they will become vulnerable or vulnerable, which may lead to violent attacks or escape attempts, is reported according to the information and evidence provided by the asylum staff during the last few months from the system.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns would increase in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where the child’s suffering is more often ignored because of its prevalence.
They add that moving children to a remote city without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or allow them to leave their friends could lead to problems that many have already experienced.
Syria forces the United States, France and Turkey's "opportunity forces" immediately carry out their war
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valids al-Moulaim (Walid al-Moualem) also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the war in the country had already lasted for eight years.
Moulalem, who also fulfils the duties of the Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria, protesting the fight against terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be dismissed immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem said that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people and millions have been forced to leave their homes since the 2011 disaster, "the war against terrorism is almost over".
He announced that Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all the Syrian territories" were opened from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States of America has set up around 2000 soldiers in Syria, mainly trained and consulted both the strength of the Kurds and the Syrian Arabs who are President Bashar Al Asada's opponents.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
With regard to the question of refugees, Mualems announced that conditions had been great for them to come back, and called on the "several Western countries" to "responsively spread Iraqi fear" because the refugees did not want to return.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicians who should be the only humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive aid for the renewal of the state before the agreement between the Assad and the opposition to the end of the war will be concluded.
The UN diplomats have made it clear that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish the buffer zone in Idlib (Idlib) based on the latest dumping opportunities has opened up for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented Russia's support for the vast-scale province of Syria's armed forces, where three million people live.
However, Moulalems stressed that the agreement "there are certain deadlines", and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jews, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy Stefans de Mistura (Stuffan de Mistura) hopes to contact the new committees, which will include government and opposition representatives, the first meetings to prepare the Syrian Constitution for the post-war period and to pave the way for the elections.
The Moulalem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the work of the Group would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the former Constitution", and warned of entry.
Why Tramps will be selected for the second time
From this point of view, Mr Trampa's 2020 election will be reversed, unless, and on this basis, it is possible that many liberal observers, officials and scandals will not be present at his presidency.
And in that case, "this will be the most dramatic final of the presidency all the time!"
At present, there is no evidence of the survival of observers.
Since 2014, ratings in the most favourable CNN aircraft have been more than doubled by reaching 1.05 million viewers, but they have nearly tripled by reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News is the most popular show of 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, informs Nielsen company, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichel Medovas show) is located at the highest level of cable television with 3.5 million main news viewers at night.
"There's a fire that attracts many people because it's something we don't understand," explained Neil Bayers (Neal Baer), the ABC drama "Designed Survivor". This drama is told by the secretary of the Cabinet, who becomes the president after the attack is destroyed by the Capitol.
Nellai Skovellei (Nell Scovell), comedy writer and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" authors are their theory.
She recalls a trip with a taximeter in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he was voting for Mr. Trampa.
She wanted to know why.
"He answered, 'Because he loves me,' told Miss Skowela.
Haoss is, of course, a traitor.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Ruu judgment against the Middle East, whether the immigrant families will be united, and the global economic situation.
Ignorance is a weakness that can only be allowed by the most vulnerable observers.
And yet, it is more than being informed by a citizen when it is time to look at six expert groups, as Bob Woodwards has used unnamed information sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort (Paul Manafort) $15,000 worth of bomber jackets from fast colors and skin ("the price of which causes high precision," said "Washington Post" and what role the Stormy Daniels will play in the shameful description of Tramppa.
I, for example, will never understand Super Mario as before.
"A part of what he does that creates this effect is that he gives you information every day," Brents Montgomery (Brent Montgomery), Executive Director "Wellhouse Entertainment" and this "Pown Stars" creator explained about Trampa's changing command and everyday appearances (Chief with N.F.L., Kima Chena's praise).
You may not be allowed to swallow a single episode, because the other side will stay.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss (Fleiss) last Monday, the time in the North Sea (Cauai) was sunny, 80 degrees (~27 after Celsia), but he sat in the rooms where, without a glance, he saw the MSNBC radiation while entering CNN.
He was unable to leave, not since Bret Kaveno (Bret Kavanaugh) had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and his future in the Supreme Court of Justice.
"I remember the time when we formed all these tracks and when people claimed that "this is the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleisa told me.
"I think it's nothing, but it seems they were right."

The money from abroad influences the most exploding election of parliamentarians in pre-election campaigns
It is no wonder that the election of the 17th Congress area of Pennsylvania has led to the receipt of money through the conversion of the region of the Congress, resulting in the two existing Members fighting one place.
This recently transformed Pittsburgh nautical area is linked to the democratic representative of Conor Lamb (Conor Lamb), who won his place in the last year's special election in another area.
Lembs will fight with another current Member, the Republican Keith Rothfus (Keith Rothfus), who is now represented in the 12th area of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new 17th.
After the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the rural areas were not constitutionally divided into good republics, the maps were processed.
In the new 17th area, competition has led to wars between the party's main financial groups: Democratic Campaign Committee (Democratic Campaign Congress Committee) and National Committee of Republican Campaign Committees (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when the elections of the late 18th Congress in Pennsylvania were won with a little overcrowded.
The Republicans had been in this area for more than 10 years, and President Donald Tramps won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide for a small surplus to the Democrats.
The United States considered Salvadoran punishment for China's support, but then thought
The diplomats recognize that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without much pressure from the Washington side.
Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting with President Juan Karlos Varel (Juan Carlos Varela) in June 2017, and he stayed in the hotel in Panama until the partners left the post office of the Trampa organisation management team.
The Department of State officials decided to withdraw the United States diplomatic missions from the Republic of El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", its representative, Hitler Nauret (Heather Nauert), indicated in a notice earlier this month.
However, the sentences were considered to refer only to Salvador, which received about 140 million large amounts from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include the reduction of financial assistance and the reduction of targeted visas, would be painful for the Central American country in which the amount of unemployment and unemployment have reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials left a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being and followed by a similar meeting last year, which was recognized as an attempt to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, the state's senior officials expressed their sincere appreciation that they wanted the conference to take place, in particular by completely completing the proceedings against El Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Penss (Mika Pence) had now decided to participate in the planned conference in mid-October to show how serious the administration is underpinning the meetings.
And three American envoys returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious reports or sentences from the Washington side.
Our White Representative, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to provide more information on the debate, which was characterised by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations if their anonymity was maintained.
His story proved to be a close external analyst who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be maintained.
Study of history
The second stone garden could contain a special report by Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Tramppa may have stopped a fair which has very much evidence in society.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trampa campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our wishes.
If there is a second party to the Congress, Trampham will be responsible for this structure and perhaps also for his party's jury right away when he is already going to meet with the voters again.
There is a lot of "bet," and I do not say that the trampa crash is inevitable or that it will happen with its fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices we will have to make for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these will show the length of the war.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take action against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czech Republic in Minhen.
We look forward to the time when we will be able to resist the spirit of the passing of years.
History is moving around such points of reference, and the unprecedented march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to fight with several such points of reference.
What will we begin if Mr. Trampa leaves General Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein (Rod Rosenstein) — a man who controls Mr. Miller's investigation license?
It has been difficult for Rosenstein since it was reported that in the past year, he proposed a secret to enter into negotiations with the President and understood his inadmissibility to the subject.
Mr Rozenstein said the story "The Times" was not accurate.
"How can we answer if the requested FBI investigation about Brit Kaveno is not complete or fair or even if he is approved by the Supreme Court of Justice for his infamous testimony and the alleged allegations of sexual assault?
And what is the most important thing, will we vote for the Congress, which will be called Trampu for responsibility, the interlocutory election?
If we don't keep all these tests, democracy will be in the dark.
However, I believe that we will do everything by referring to what was taught in Prague.
My mother was a Hebrew of Czech origin, who sent to Auschwitz exactly the same Nazi regime that once took my place in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to put a Saturday invitation on the table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

"Rangers" star Grems Dorans (Graham Dorrans) felt optimistic about fighting wine "Rapid"
"Rangers" will be taken to their own "Rapid" wine on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after an impressive undisputed game in Spain with "Villareal" earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position in order to qualify from the European League G group.
The road trauma did not allow Grem Doransam to start participating in the season games until the undistributed result with 2:2 with "Villareal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a tramplin to achieve more.
"We can be happy about this because "Villarreal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballist.
"We must play to see that we are able to achieve good results, and we gain this point.
We may have been able to reach them at the end, but in general there is no good result.
They may have been better in the first half, but we found ourselves in the second half and were better teams.
And on Thursday there will be another important night in Europe.
We hope we will get three points, but it will not be easy to play because they have achieved good results in the previous game, but I am confident that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and achieve good results.
The past year with all my troubles and changes in the same club was certainly a big deal, but now new news about what would be good.
The team is great, and the boys learn it; the coach is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave the past season behind the wall and succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they are worried about their pensions
Although the interviewees clearly knew what care they would want to receive, few had discussed the matter with family members.
About half of the individuals in the national study indicated that they did not talk to a married friend about the long-term cost of care.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of their family members, but nothing does to address them," says Holly Snaider (Holly Snyder), Vice-President of the State Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to your married friend and your children. You can’t prepare your family for the need to take care of yourself if you don’t do your best in the past.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices may be an important factor in determining costs.
Integrate your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you to think about how to cover these costs.
Your possibility of providing long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with a sum of money to cover these costs or also insurance using your assets – mainly for you to earn money.
Make your legal documents. Avoid legal battles even before they start.
Talk to qualified people about health issues so that you can be a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you do not force them to express themselves.
Consider also the possibility of granting financial authority.
Choose reliable individuals to make financial decisions on your behalf who will be willing to pay your bills if you do not force them to do so on your own.
And don't forget the seemingly specific details! Imagine that one of your parents is being taken to a hospital to get help.
Will you start to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please indicate these facts in a written plan so that this situation does not change you will not be prepared.
"We talk not only about finances, but also about who's a doctor," said Martina.
"What are the medicines used for?
What are you gonna do about the dog?
Prepare to develop such a plan."

According to government information, a strong earthquake and tsunami, which visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, has killed at least 384 people. It is expected that the number of victims will increase.
As a result of the reported communication, the rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the region of Dongala (Dongla) located in the north of Palu and is close to 7.5 magnets in a strong earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after natural disasters.
See basic information about Palu and Dongal, located on the island of Sulvalis:
The palace is the capital of Central Sulawesi (Central Sulawesi) and is located in the heart of the coastal plain on the west coast of Sulawesi. It is estimated that 379 800 people lived in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
The Danube is a region that extends about 300 km (180 km) along the north-west coast of the island of Sullavasi.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299,200 people were living in the area of the provincial administrative region.
Fishing and fishing is a base for the Central Sulawesi Province economy, particularly in the region of the present Dongala.
The oil production is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovil (Moroulia), in the opposite country.
As reported by the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered several times from tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Tonga.
The tsunami also struck over the eastern part of Tonga in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is a semi-active in the Pacific Ocean fire that regularly forms underground.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in the last year:
2004: A strong earthquake in North Sumatra caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries on 26 December to kill 226 000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were found in the Aegean.
2005: A strong series of earthquakes visited the west of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Seventy people went to the wilderness of Nineveh (Nia) to the coast of Sumatra.

More than 1100 people went to the battle.
2010: 7.5 Magnificent earthquakes visited one of the islands of Mentavai (Mentawai) on the coast of Sumatra, causing up to 10 metres high tsunamis that blew ten and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake hit the area of Piedie Jaya in the Aegean region of Pieddie Jaya because it reminded him of the destruction of the earthquake and tsunamis that struck him in 2004.
Now there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed in the lack of homes.
2018: strong earthquakes visited the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok (Lombok), killing more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake covered thousands of buildings, and in time hundreds of tourists were forced to return home.

Federal prosecutors want to request a recent death warrant for a person who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to request execution of the execution of Saijfullo Saifovam, Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state of federal crimes since 1953.
As claimed, 30-year-old Saipovs used "Home Depot" to hire cars to launch an attack on a speeding train on West Side Highway in Lejas Manhattan (lower Manhattan), where he drove passengers and passengers on his way in October.
In order to justify execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed eight victims "with intent" and "with intent" caused serious trauma, as stated in the report on the intention to request a death penalty submitted by the New York Southern Court.
According to the court document, in both cases, a death penalty may be considered.
Within weeks of the attack, a large jury adopted a complaint against Saipova on 22 charges, which included eight complaints for the excretion of fraud, which were commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as the complaint about the injury and the destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack needed "a significant planning and a prior order", explained the prosecutor, saying that the attack by Saipova was "severe, unhappily and inhumanly".
"Saifullo Habibuljevičs Saipovs (Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov) injured, injured and wounded these human families and friends: Diego Enrike Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Klivs (Nicholas Cleveland), Anna-Lorija Decadta (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darens Dreks (Darren Drake), Ariels Elihs (Ariel Erlij), Ernest Feruchi (Hernan Ferruchi), Ernest Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pannocco (Alejan Damian Pannucci), written in a statement of opinion.
Five of them were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the New York District Court have filed a complaint in a case in which a death sentence can be prosecuted.
The accused Kalids Bärns (Khalid Barnes) was sentenced to two drug suppliers' detentions, but he was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in late 2009.
The Christmas season was last held in the New York federal case in 1953 in July and Etheli Rozenberg (Julus and Ethel Rosenberg) — a wedding ceremony attended after the death of the defendant for his participation in the European Union in the good war two years ago.
The death penalty for Rozenberg was executed on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, during days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
As reported by the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to a complaint, Saipov told officials that he found an attempt to launch an attack after ISIS video viewing on his phone.
The police informed him that he had also requested permission to issue an ISIS card in his court.
He has rejected 22 charges.
David Patton (David Patton), one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he is "very, of course not satisfied" with the decision of the complaint.
"We believe that the intention to request the death penalty is not to accept the recognition of the death penalty in exchange for eternal imprisonment without the right to release will only extend the trauma created in the event to all parties involved," explained Patons.
The Saipa defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
The Conservative Member announces that the management of the Brexita negotiations should be entrusted to NAIDŽELAM FARAZAM
During the protest, Najžel Faráž's "mobilize the people's army" in the Conservative Conference today.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independent Party announced that politicians should be aware of the tensions of Eurosceptics when one of the members of the Parliament of the Council of Teresa proposed that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
The Conservative Executive Board of Peter Bouns (Peter Bone) announced to March in Birmingham that Britain had already appeared if Mr. Brekskit was a minister.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs Mejas, trying to link his opponent's armed party, demonstrated conservatives who supported the stay of the EU and joined the individual protests in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister will strive to maintain its compromise plan on future relations between the UK and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and to hear attacks from those who want to leave the EU, those who want to remain in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The audience agreed that she would try to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and let Eurosceptics and lobbyists choose between her offer and her "haous".
Mr. Bouna "Leave Means Leave" announced that he wanted to destroy the Measan Plan at Solihall (Solihull) on the site.
He suggested that Pharaoh make public and trust him with Brussels.
"If he had been saying, we'd already gone," Bouns said.
Parliament's member from Velingboro (Wellingborough) added: "I will support Brexito, but we must abandon the Measles Plan tomorrow!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to be servants!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored the adoption that the public opinion might have changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain in the EU is absolutely inconceivable."
Brexit's assistant Andrea Jenkins (Andrea Jenkyns) also participated in March, and the reporters said: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequer's plan is not popular, the opposition does not vote for it, it is not popular for our party and our supporters who really do all the work and our will.
Please answer from Chequers and begin to listen."
In the case of Meju, she adds: "The Prime Minister remains in his place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in the past would have to be forced if they failed to comply with the decision adopted in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us, people, and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to take Brexit and we're here today to show them that we're not going to let them do it."
In his message, he adds: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to transfer Brexito, feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the war on Brexit, and we will never be saved until we become independent, independent, happy United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the Palicians traveled through Birmingham before a two - hour journey to the city center.
Unbeknownst activists welcomed conservatives against the Breksita banners after a group meeting this week.
The representative of the Party of the Parties, Lords Adonis, welcomed the Conservatives on the safety issues they faced with the party's application at the beginning of the Conference.
"These are people who claim that they are able to maintain the IT system order and all their technology for Canada and yet, and still, at the border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he adds.
"It's an absolute farce.
No such thing as a successful Brekstis," he added.
Vorena is planning to apply for the president of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Vorena says that her "sounded mind" candidate will be elected by the President of the United States after November's election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the Masačuset democracy spoke about its future in the city of Westmascus.
Vorena, who is often criticised by President Donaldu Trampu, participates in the repeated elections in November and in a candidate against the Republican Geofu Dil of the GOP, who was Vice-President of the March 2016 campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main candidate for the candidate against Trampu in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, Holyoke had her 36th meeting with the voters, using the city’s radio station since Tramps entered her office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to apply for the president's election.
Vorena replied that there is a real time for "there are women in Washington who are "salabos" imperfect government, which also means women-presidents."
With regard to the removal of Simsa from the LSU Basketbolist
The baton Rouge police reported on Saturday in Los Angeles that the suspect was arrested on the basis of a five-day arrest by the LSU basketball player Veida Simsa.
The batonry police officer announced that at 11.00 a.m. Daiteons Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested.

Russia Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton is visiting the World Championship title after the team allows him to overcome Sebastian Fate
From the time Valteri Botas qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton became clear that the work of the Mercedes team would play an important role in competitions.
From the start, Botas started out well and almost left Hamilton in the woods, protecting his place in the first two trips and invited Fetel to attack his teammates.
The girl first walked into the church and left Hamilton in the community to end up with the others, which was most likely decisive.
Mercedes's pilot was completed later and returned from Festela, but Hamilton continued to lead in the exercise of power, which saw Ferrari's driver leaving the inside without delay, risking leaving behind a doublemanoeuvre to protect the third floor.
Max Verstapens started from the back row and was seven at the end of his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the story because he focused on the clothes to quickly reach the finish line and kill Kim Raikonen on the fourth floor.
Finally, in about 44 C.E., he entered the temple, but he could not increase speed in the remaining eight o’clock of the night, for Raicon remained in the fourth.
This is a hard day because Valter was doing great work all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team has done an extremely important job to get one of the two," Hamiltons said.
It was a very bad body language.
On Saturday's Saturday, President Donald Tramps congratulated Senator Diana Feinstein on his failure to reject the letter of the Christian Blesia Forda, in which he accused the Supreme Court's candidate, Bret Kaveno, of sexual harassment.
Speaking in the spring of West Virginia, the president did not directly speak of the Forda testimony it gave to the Senate's legal commission, but commented that what happened to the Senate showed that people are "bad, insensitive and untrustworthy."
"The man who can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate when there is a spirit when he sees people in despair, evil, insensitive and untrustworthy," he said.
"When the press release and misleading information were released and they said, "Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Atceries?
Deana Fenstein, have you misjudged the information?
Remember her answer to the question... or did you mislead the document? - "Well, what did I do?"
But no.
I didn't do it."
All right, wait for the miracle.
Did we do it... No, we didn't," he adds, in the Senator's intonation.
A letter was sent to Finland in July, explaining in detail what Forda is accused of Kaveno, and the content of the letter was issued in early September, but Finland refused to do so in her office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Forda's accusations, I've "nonployed" her story, "Fenstein told the commission, reports "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it."
But her refusal did not like the president, who commented on this situation in the evening of the evening: "I would say to you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst part of the body language I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the High Court candidate, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that democracy use complaints for its own good.
"They are targeted to recover power through any means."
Whether they see the evil, the insensitive, they don't care what they're suffering that they have to lose in order to gain power and control," said the president's report "Media".

Car crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash
A flight was carried out by the airline during which a plane was hit in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia and now claimed that one of the people was missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the flying machine.
"Air Niugini" announced the press release on Saturday afternoon when they were unable to answer as one of the passengers — men.
The company reported working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find missing men.
The public immediately did not respond to requests for more information on passengers, such as their age and nationality.
Local people with ships helped save other passengers and crew after the aircraft was loaded into the water by attempting to escape the island of Chuuk.
The officials said that seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The company reported that six people remained in the hospital until the sixth day, and all of them are in a stable condition.
There is still no clear reason for the accident and the sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Marine fleet report that the aircraft is incorporated into the ship shortly after landing from the train.
Some airmen thought that the plane would be reevaluating the length of the flight.
American passenger Bill Jenins said the plane was very low.
"That was really good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the floating plane using emergency exits because the water was only until midnight.
He said that the rats were in panic and crying, as well as that he had a slight headache.
U.S. seafarers working near to improve the ship’s crew also contributed to rescue operations by using the floating vessel to catch people on the shore before the flight would take about 30 metres (100 feet) below water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last two decades of PNG registered airlines 111 people have been appointed, no one has been connected to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalysis commentator explains what happened during the night in which the woman was burned alive
The complaint gave evidence once a week in the case under review where a man is charged with the rape of a living woman in 2014.
Paul Rovlets, a member of the U.S. Department of Psychoanalysis of the U.S. Department of Justice, has been a witness for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained how he used the information he had received from the telephone to gather together how 29 - year - old Quintons Telis and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers had been in the new prison at night when she was bedridden.
Rovlet said that he received the location data from several telephones that showed that Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, arguing his previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police took him out of Sanford.
On Saturday at the court’s office, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford machine that night, Sanford said he was "good because my machine was in Nešvil."
Another misunderstanding was that Telis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks when he fell asleep.
The phone records show that they only know each other for weeks.
Rovlet said that shortly after the death of Chambers, He destroyed the news, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He destroyed him from his life," said Heils.
It is expected that the defences will provide their concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped that the trial would be handed over to the accused later this very day.

Back to the black?!
In New York, the plant proposed a release after receiving the "racist" news
In New York, the court proposed a renegade of discrimination after she had received misbehavior news from a mother who complained that the plant "is still in black."
Paris prohibits it from being found by comparing the court's law to "pressure".
Lindsia Plasko-Flaksmana, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment at knowing that a new child nurse, George Maurissa, was blackmailed when she started her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't know, ATKAL MELNAIS," Plasko-Flacsman wrote to his husband in a short time.
However, she sent the message to her husband, not to Maurizio, but to another couple of times.
In the face of his inaction, the "samulous" plastic-Flacsman release from Mauritius, stating that his former afro-American college had done a bad job and that she had been in the Philippines, referring to New York Post.
Maurizio paid for her one day’s work and sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mauritsa has appealed to the court, asking for compensation for her resignation and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with a secure residence, which she initially requested, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't do," she said on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
After all, they have found that Maurice’s retirement was a wise decision because they feared that she would not be able to trust her after her divorce.
"My wife sent her what she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not found," Joel Plasko, a man, said "Post."
"Bet, would you trust your children to someone against whom you held a grudge, even if it was just because of a mistake?
All the bridesmaids?
But think about it."
The judge's sitting as a "pressure," Plasko said that his wife had only been born a few months back and found very "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you really going against something like this?
It is not an acceptable action," adds the investment chain.
While justice continues to be done, public opinion is quickly passed on through social networks, denying them their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington book were worried that readers could not associate with the speaker’s light
Karen Jenkele, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself "in some corner", which read the book first before it was published.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about the great achievements of Paddington."
She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "salden acid" after Father’s release last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls "a very important member of the family", her father listened intently to her possible achievements.
"He was a deaf man, a deaf man and not a great man," she said.
"That's why Paddington was so real to him, it was just like if you have a child who gets something: you're beautiful even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's achievements in a similar way.
Although it was her creation and her image's fruit, he always gave all the fortunes to Paddington's own."
I had to get out of my dead daughter's phone.
After her pregnancy, her daughter was quickly taken to the hospital of Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"We called regularly and said that it was very bad and expected her not to survive," Edna-Laperuza said.
"Then I received a call from Neda, saying that her dream was approaching for two minutes and I had to get out of her.
And so did I.
I said, "Yes, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctor gave her in order to maintain her heart rate gradually stopped and left her body.
She would have died sooner, and it was all over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't wait or cry because I'll be in a situation where there's family and people around.
I needed a lot of power to rule."
Finally, after losing a girl in a terrible accident, Edna-Laperuza got into a car with other passengers who were not even aware of what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I cut my head off on the floor and cut my hair all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
A pregnant woman wears cards on her back to prevent suicide
Two women who are loved by people who have committed suicide act to help others not to take their life.
Mr. Davis and Kelija Hamfrija strengthen the cards at the Welsh port with inspiring messages and telephone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
He was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want a parent to live up to what I do every day," she said.
David, who lives in Lithuania for 45 years, says that his son was a very violent man with a bad temper.
"Everyone knows him after laugh.
Everyone always said that his smile was always and everything."
But he refused to work before he fell asleep because he was "very, very dark."
In 2014, Taylor’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after he had committed suicide.
He said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to happen."
David created cards, "to let me know that there are people with whom you can turn and talk, even if it is a friend.
You don't have to sit in the classroom, you have to talk."
For years, a brother named Davis lost his wife, Mark, to his 15 - year - old companion, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say that he was right or was depressed or anything else was right," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that her attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened the gift, he did not create eye contact with them or something like that."
His death was a great tragedy for children, but they have to end up saying, "It affects the whole family.
That's our decision.
But we all have to keep fighting and fight."

British Kaveno's future in the war air, because the FBI is starting the investigation
"I think that if we could really get what he asked for — time and amount in limited research — we could achieve little consensus," Fleeks announced on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the commission "parts" between the ruling party.
Why do Kaveno and his Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their stay is only corruption.
The election will be held after five weeks on 6 November — if the Republicans are expected to do something bad, their efforts will be much weaker in order to select the highest court man from among them.
George V. Bush called the senators, urging them to support Kaveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thank him for his wife, Ešli, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in Senate, where 51 seats will now belong to the Republicans but 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Kaveno can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pensam, Vice-President, to vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kima's leadership has "redened" the number of political asylum seekers in North Korea
The number of political asylum seekers in North Korea has decreased since Kim Jongs returned seven years ago, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, said there were 1127 political asylum seekers last year compared with 2011 when it was 2706.
The park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the high levels of human contraband are the main factors.
Pyongyang's public comments have not been submitted.
The majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are offered in the end of South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them are passed through China, which has the highest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily closed Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's political asylum seekers consider illegal immigrants to be illegal and deport them on a growing scale.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which continues to be a technical war, has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries were given Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearisation talks.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between Presidents Donaldu Trampu and Kima Jongun Singapore, when they agreed to cooperate to release the Korean side from nuclear weapons.
But on the sixth day, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho condemned US sanctions since these negotiations had made no progress.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our country's security, and under such circumstances we will never be able to defend the first one," Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Ninsia Pelosi calls Bret Kaveno "historical" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Court of the Minority, Ms. Pelosi, called the Supreme Court's candidate Bret Kaveno "historical" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperature.
Pelosi gave comments during the interview on the sixth day of the "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austria, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if the women had taken this way, they would call him "historical," said Pelosi about their reaction to Kaveno's testimony to the Senate justice commission on Thursday.
Kaveno’s emotional defense against sexual harassment by Dr. Kristin Blesia Forda when they were both teenagers.
In his opening argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost crying and smiling, talking about his family and school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling against them the allegations of "sudden and coordinated destruction of the character" organized by liberals, who are sad that Hillary Clinton lost the president's election in 2016.
Pelosi said that he believed that the evidence of Calvin was the reason that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a dual attitude toward the Democrats.
"I think that he himself discriminates against himself with such statements and his attitude towards whom he has dealt with Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when he asked her if she would try to doubt Kaveno if she approved it and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say it—if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not applicable not only to the Supreme Court, but also to work in the current court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno, now, is the judge of the Washington Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, he has been disappointed by the possibility that Kaveno takes decisions against "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Fair because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Kaveno asked whether he would reject the Supreme Court decisions.
"There is no time for the court to work historically and twofold, but I would expect us to be happy to say, 'Is it not wonderful?' said Pelosi.
But women must keep their hands.
It's a detonation, months and years, and it's all broken down "a few pieces", but she's not allowed it all out of her mind to do it.
"We laugh when we're tired," said Mrs. Steinema after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something that doesn't happen to you?"
She continued, "Once I was greatly helped by a woman who was herself the leader of a company who said that she was also the driver when she was a spiritist, but she developed a technique – when she became sad and began to laugh, to her person she was in conversation with, she said, "You may think I am ashamed, because I'm mad.
I'm tired."
And then she kept going.
And I think it's great."
Asphalt is only partly recognized as a form of dust discharge, because it is used on its own grounds.
One of my greatest memories is of my former job as a man’s specialty when I once became pregnant because of a sudden depression when my older sister, who was still in the care of me, was a permanent manager (wife), who always put me in a low - risk condition.
"Never let them see that smile!" she said to me.
"They don't know how you're going to get over it.
They think you're tired, and they're just happy that you're out of the skin.
Patrice Shrēder, then the U.S. Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked together with Gerius Hart towards his election as president of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hart, who had arrived in foreign relations, was also called the "floating" ship and came out of the choice, Shreeder, expressed deep regret that there was no reason why he could not apply for a presidential appointment.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she said to me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last thing they wanted to find was another one.
It was the one who called it "Snegbelts and Seven Wounds."
She wanted to take part in the campaign, withdrew funds, and promised not to participate unless 2 million US dollars were collected.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 to the male class, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a divorce?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her — to the system that made it very difficult to get money and not to speak to the voters, and anxious about sex — in which she was "damaged".
"You think I have a nervous breakdown," recalled Shrēder in the memory of how the press responded to him.
"You think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they'd write on my jacket.
"She's a hero."
Why the US-China Trade War may be a blessing to Beijing
The main accusations of the beginning of a trade war between the United States and China are hidden and until the war is over, differences between countries can be favourable in the long term in Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Tramps issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most importantly, this week's auction began with new rates affecting the unit's value of 200 billion dollars (150 billion dollars), immediately covering half of the goods exported from the US from China.
Pekina also answers "old" every time, the latest is five to ten percent of the price of $60 billion for American goods.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to one another by the United States and is doubtful that, in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be reduced.
In order to withdraw Washington, it would be necessary to agree to certain requirements, but to publicly appeal to the US would be too much for China's President Xi Shi Dji Jijjungpin.
However, experts say that if Pekina plays its own rank correctly, the US military pressure can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the mutual dependence of the economies of both countries on each other.
"The fact that a political decision was quickly taken in Washington, or Beijing, could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any country, which are really more dangerous than did previous observers," said a New American Security researcher focusing on Asia.
Syria is "gatava" for the return of refugees, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced.
Syria claims that there is a ready return of refugees and calls on them to help restore countries that have been embroiled in war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualems said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to renew its normal status in the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorist and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and their lasting well-being.
The UN believes that since the beginning of the war in 2011, the countries have fallen by 5.5 million Syrians.
More than six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
The Germans said that the Syrian regime would take assistance in the restoration of the State.
But he stressed that the State would not accept the aid or aid from countries that helped to sponsor the poor.
European golf course in Paris
The European golf course was won by the 2018 Raider cause, and the US was defeated with a result of 16.5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in Europe and has not won the Raider Tower since 1993.
Europe recovered the case when the team, led by Mr. Thomas Bjorn, received 14,5 points that were needed to re-examine the U.S.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time running all the tournaments, drew his T-cocini into the water at par 3 16.
The Italian golfer Molinari played a game in all its stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever won 5-0-0 results since 1979 when the tournament is played in an existing format.
American Jordan Spitts with 5 against 4 had literally lost the European team, after riding, to the lowest existing player in Torbjorn Olesem from Denmark.
World's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polytera from England, where this was probably the last Raider cup.
The eight-year-old veter, Spain's Serhio Garcia, became the best player in the tournament all the time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I don't care, but today I can't control the bears."
This was a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas from the heart that he beat me and hit me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the case.
This is the team's dream and I am happy that I can help," said Garcia after the European election emotionally.
He gives his next name to his people John Rama, who won the U.S. golfer Tagger Woods on Sunday with 2 against 1 singles.
"It's the flame I'd feel when I hit Taier Vudsu, I'd wake up following this player's pace," said a 23-year-old novel in Rome.
Võds lost all his four cats in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 Raider.
The statistics are not always one of the best players who won 14 high-level golf tournaments on the other side of Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team has been fighting all week to find their fortunes, except Patrick Ride, Justin Tomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf all tournaments.
U.S. president Jim Furics, after his team's unsatisfying performance, said: "I'm pretty with boys, they're fighting.
It was a moment when we were able to create a small pressure on the European team.
We fought.
I'm very grateful to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players called a very good game.
We will be restructured, I will work with the US PGA and the U.S. Raider Coast Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm happy to be his captain.
You have to go to your own graveyards.
We won."
