When he called, the professor admitted that he shot his friend.
During the call to the emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb acknowledged to the police that he had shot his friend and that it was necessary to get him home.
Lamb assumed that his "slow dog" was at home alive and probably broken, and that contact with the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and manually written a report on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I'm sorry to be able to come back, I loved Amy and she's the only one who loved me," remained in a letter signed by the authorities Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would be 300 miles to a school campus where the police think he shot beloved Professor Ethan Schmidt at his office's doors.
The chief of police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb first made a boring phone on the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came to him.
The day after the shooting at school, the students and the college were brought in to hide behind closed doors, and the trusted authorities are still trying to figure out what Lambov's motivation was.
Details published by researchers on the side of the state and students and employees who knew it were jointly created by a talented but probably a problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they were happy at his school.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record in a criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote to thank the "great people" with which he shared academic life.
Both attended the School of Social Sciences and history together with the other 17 members of the faculty, and many students went to courses together.
At the same time, inclinations have emerged when it comes to problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed angry and frustrated, "as if nothing had happened to him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, pointed out that Lamb told him that there was stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for freedom for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he only studied two online courses.
Recent changes in the number of university employees indicated that a doctor whose Lamb worked hard not to guarantee his automatic working period to become a professor's assistant.
The president of the University of William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamba must have suffered something."
The Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left the camp, the police grabbed his foot when he crossed the borders of the state of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was killed by a single gun bomb at the door of his parents at Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed by the Crown of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, even though Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb started to work at a university that has 3,500 students in a city that has about 12000 inhabitants in 2009 and has taught the country and the hours of education.
He's got a doctor at the university.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambus 20, when they met with fellow friends.
She was with her friends at high school and he was the great older boy who had taught her to play guitar for several years.
It was quite a heart attack at the time.
The hearts of all the girls grew as they appeared," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives on Jackson's property.
Lamb and Prentiss had been together for some time.
During a emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but I never had a wedding record.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a cycyllic home that comes with the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely ruined," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She had a best friend with her mother.
He said he didn't sit with Lambe, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail attended an annual festival three years ago.
Later, they played decent gygi together.
Oh, Steven said his daughter's writing and singing her own song.
Prentiss was a healthy sister who worked for different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and an appropriate entertainment coordinator in The Julep Room, a very bright bar near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamba and Prentiss on the night of 5 September, the path Lamb had lost on the guitar and harmony for endless tax.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We made it easy and played together on a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murder professor, conducted a seminar in the first anniversary and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of a male student club and student government.
About 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial campaign in Cleveland on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in the campaign during which the university council called "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
She started school again in the middle.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is for us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported to Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was prepared to reflect on the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a phone call on the emergency line after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were really dating.
Toys R Us is planning to hire less seasonal workers.
These R Us declare that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the producer of child games and products claims that it will allow modern employees and seasonal workers to work more hours.
The company also indicated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in trade and distribution centres throughout the country, which is a decrease of 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be on a part-time basis.
The company announces that it will start with a collection of candidates this month, and the employee will be gathered by October to December.
While holidays alone are far away, the shopping holiday season is close and companies are ready to take temporary staff to help in trade and sales, to send and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox tweets about his "arde" with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the palace and waited for the coming of the royal family when I realized that the sitting next to me was empty and I found that Princess Diana would sit there," said the trailer for the accompanying document, "Go back in time."
The film starts and makes me realize that I'm about to have something to call a fake meeting with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in time," is a document on "Back to the Future," which introduces talks with Foxe, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Landeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The Prime Minister "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the best travel document for me that was ever filmed."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
The Head of the UN says there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's rapid military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict in almost five years of conflict, and more weapons are only worse than the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the OSCE immediately called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support the inclusive political settlement.
Ban told the Central Press Conference that he was planning to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the country - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of the Ministerial Meeting of the Valne Assembly at the end of this month because of the situation in Syria.
He expressed his concern that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional authorities "have made this situation unsolved."
The Ban called on five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and units to demonstrate when the Iranian nuclear agreement was reached in the Syrian crisis resolution.
8 vol. numbers showing that Donald Trump is in real light
Some have tried to mark him as a person who often changes views.
The rest of them held their hands like an unspoken joke.
And some are ready for the implosion.
But if some of the Republicans are already trying to pull Donalda Trump down from the top of the vote, they will not be able to do so (still).
10 of the last 11 national studies show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people start asking seriously what this means for the nominal chance of this magnet in the area of property.
Of course, it's still the beginning of a voluntary cycle.
Nothing of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead to Herman Cain's entry into office did not finally win one position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could find himself in general elections.
But outside groups like Super PAC's Jeba Bush and the Economic Conservative Group of Club for Growth are aware of Trumpov's desire to maintain and begin to express their dollars on the stand with a view to raising him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the actual magnitude is not just an intermediate phase:
The noise assessment was based on 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, the Monmouth University poll showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real magnet.
In half of June, it was 40 percent already.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a reputation for Donald Trumpa.
Three out of 10 say they have a negative view of him.
And this number is going to be in the initial stages.
Following the vote of the University of Quinnipiac, which last week, it was found that 60 per cent of the Republicans had a positive opinion on the Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be at peace with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey that last week, 67 per cent of Republicans indicated that they would either be "responsive" or "peace" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 indicated that they would be "refused" from his candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates the same level of overcrowding as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "damaged" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest to top level?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters claim that they would be "unsatisfied" or "dissolved", if they were to favour the business Jeb Bush as a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his arrogance and injury, 52 per cent of Republican voters were strongly influenced by the idea that he actually has the right temperature for the president's post, according to ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the State Senatorial Club of Iowa, which is the first in the whole country where 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the personality of the leader, according to Quinnipic from last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent feel that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independents say that his temperature does not fall to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to this opinion.
When they set up their student clubs, the Republican voters think that Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC study last week.
It's a change from late July when four out of 10 saved their money on the fucking Bush.
Full publication: GOP fans did not in the past have the worst crystal balls in the world.
In the past cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a candidate for 28 per cent for the possible appointment of Mitta Romney.
However, it is shown that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans gathered around the other candidate, the Trump also offends almost everyone.
Some students point out that the affected field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trupov's support is widely extended between more than a dozen other candidates.
But a study of Monmouth University from the beginning shows that in the hypothetical direct file between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always majority support.
He runs over Carly Fiorino on 13 points, Mark Rubie on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Fuck Bushem on 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasache, Christ on 33 points in each.
He's in the dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would take over a dealer with 19 points in a hypothetical plot against one another.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters claim they've already made their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT survey shows that more than half of the supporters of the Trump claim that their opinion is no longer changing.
It is obvious that many things can change, and no one can honestly say that he would never change his opinion.
46 per cent indicate that they leave open the rear door to change between candidates.
However, Trump's current most powerful opponent is his outsider neurochirg Ben Carson, but voters who consider their final opinion to go twice more likely to love Trumpa.
6 out of 10 Republicans have officially agreed with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump has called immigrants from Mexico "union" in his campaign's reputation, immigration remains the main and central theme of the 2016 conversion.
Some fear that Trump's boutiques are sending the key Spanish volunteers away from the Republican side and the damage of the rebending effort.
However, according to a new study of the ABC/Post public opinion, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems as long as the subject of immigration remains in the form of reflectors, Donald Trump will also remain.
Frustration from government achieves new maximums.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive half of the support from the Republican voters, and this is mainly due to their state of foreign citizens.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post's new Monday vote claim that they want a political outsider better than someone with government experience.
And they're also very upset at Washington.
The vote of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowj a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowj were frustrated in Congress, 54 per cent were "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent "failed."
In short, the majority of the state's oil taxes have been supported.
Chesko gets more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Senate supported the government's new top law, which governs the high cost of payments from the upper floor of a small coal company.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the Members that they would earn more money than the state fund, as well as citizens' budgets.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition messengers who feared that forced companies would no longer want to sponsor citizens as long as they were, because they would pay higher payments directly to the public budget.In the first reading, they supported the government's new top law, which also meant that the state should receive a higher share of the tax on the upper level of the debt from the public.
The country's share increases by 67 per cent, while the city's share decreases by 75 per cent by 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the wages for non-growths that companies make.
The change in non-increasing payments will lead to a State deficit of 427 million more than in 2013.
At the expense of the citizens' budgets, the government has a neutral impact, because the payments have to be higher.
In the previous year, citizens received 450 million kroner payments and a national budget of 150 million kroner.
Some 200 million kroner and a state of 66 million kroner went from the weight of an anchovy.
The novel is also calculated by increasing the rewards from the available space with a authorized weight of 1000 kroner per hectare per year.
Acceptance of these awards is still to be seen in the full extent of the city.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (CHSSD) told the Members that the cities are getting 14 million to 100 million crowns annually.
The higher tax rates will no longer be defined by the law but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The award will be re-calculated as part of the amount of the weighted growth and the rates for individual types of non-growths.
According to the Government, changes have led to a positive reaction to the current economic situation.
The ODS Ambassador Marek Benda, however, warned that the establishment of a fee by the government regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, in this case, Minister Mádka said that the tax is not taxed because the state is paying for the state's non-growth, which is the state's property.
Payments are granted only to citizens whose territories are seriously affected.
In the case of deep difficulties, three quarters of the city's money and a fourth of the state's will be obtained.
The same will be true in the event of the difficulty of radioactive Horns.
Part of the money you're going to spend on the money you're making from your hard work will be tied up.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to damage after pregnancy or in order to ensure the protection of the pension.
The proposal was criticized by opposition messengers, who in particular claimed that the damage to civilians was caused by oppression and the country.
For example, Michael Kuchera (TOP 09 and the Oldest) warned that tax firms would no longer want to sponsor citizens as long as they are, because they will pay higher payments directly to the public budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Susvit) selected in the Austrian country.
Before the growth of unemployment in the Mosteck, KSCHM had protected the KSCHM Hana Aúlická.
Kádner and Aúlicka successfully proposed a new ban, Kuchera wanted to return the government to work.
In the original report, it is estimated that, according to the company's firm, the increase in wages is inevitable in the price of coal because prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
The main consumers as electrical or thermal should therefore not feel the price rising.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that active organisations will be able to compensate for increased profits by their efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the government consents.
However, it argues that the increase in wages from employment is essential.
According to the report to the new Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is key that the Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the decisions of the government on the limits of the burden burden.
If it's hard to bear beyond limits, then it's gonna have consequences for the state and the citizens, it'll raise.
The City does not agree with Mádek that the decision on the crossing of the border to the lower Czechoslovakian army should be lifted by 2020.
The limits below ČSA should be extended, according to it, for reasons of social, national and long-term stability of nuclear energy.
Happy to see Chechny as a unit, finding an influential time.
All four times tennis will appear in the fourth rescue of Davis's palace in India on tables and this time each of them will most likely be involved in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans that, in view of the difficult conditions, the load will be spread throughout the quarter.
In Dilli there is heat and high humidity of air, so there are expected to be plenty of fun that can last up to five seconds.
We've got to take it in the way.
I'd like to spread it in time.
And according to what it will look like, Naturnit said at the current training of the Czech election in the center of Radje Kumara Khanny.
With a single team and the world's fourth-year-old Jire Wessel, he's counting into the fifth and seventh games.
The two positions are probably opposed to Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štepanek.
I'd like them to join almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not saying it yet, Captain said.
Another security in the Czech system should be the participation of Štépánk in Saturday four.
It's just a question of who's standing next to the tested debist who's in Davis's play in four balancees 18:4.
It's probably not gonna be happy.
There's a chance with Rosa or Adam Pavlasky.
"I really don't know who and how it's going to look," he said.
It's decided according to the development of two.
Varantou can be Pavlašek, with Vesel’s surprise in the 1st round of the battle in the deep over Australia.
"He's in deep obedience," said Naturnit.
It was against Australia, and if I were to play, I'd like to introduce the same performance as I showed from the second set.
"I like these experiences and I like to bring the point," said Paulašek.
Home home to two Yuki Bhambris (125. in the ATP puzzle), who won the last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he won the third and fourth ranks of the puzzle.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
Both are players from the challengers and our experience from the ATP Tour, but many times we have convinced ourselves that the hijackers in Davis aren't going to win.
"It resolves the current form, times," said Navrat.
The flight openings start at 6:30 SELČ and can be delayed for time.
According to the prediction, he's got a ring, and he's not under the roof.
However, the game can be played by artificial lighting.
They've already tasted it, and it's got some two thousand lux, which's enough.
"It should be buried under the light," said Naturnit.
Jeremy Corbyn will start at Prime Minister's Questions
From his choice, Mr Corbin's debt in PMQ is highly expected
New work leader Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and first he will have to work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will be the first of his six assigned questions shortly after Monday, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and the messengers.
In a week's speech, he asked for "the less of a feast and more of the facts."
He also indicated that he could skip several sessions that would leave his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary lead test for Mr Corby, who comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his internship to the TUC Annual Congress.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Leader to speak in silence during the service of the National Hymme in the afternoon for the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle on Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members, and it is the focus of a few stories on the title pages.
Mr Corbin's decision not to sing a national hymme has attracted attention
Speaking, Mr Corbyna said he'd be in a silent silence and he'd recognize "the glory of the king's flight in the battle for Britain."
However, Mr. Corbina, Owen Smith, has sent the BBC Two's Newsnight program to recommend a national hymme "without regard" to his conviction that it should be destroyed by a monarchy.
Almost a thousand Chinese ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbin's top team, cited differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentarians initially supported him as a leader.
Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "resorted" after Mr Corbin's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government threshold.
Mr Corbyl pointed out at the TUC conference that the Share Party had proposed changes to remove the entire opinion of the dose limit.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, a shadow worker and debts, pointed out that the party "very clearly" announced government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Head of the Department, to whom David Cameron has been appointed for the last decade since his election as the director of the Conservatives.
The head of the trade party who has promised a different approach to politics claims that he has "from the tax" views on Mr Cameron's questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too competitive and that it is kept as "precious answers," both in the sense of trade, and instead promises that it focuses on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow business secretary, will represent him on PMQ when he is not involved — for example, when Mr. Cameron leaves abroad.
He also left the idea that he would let other colleagues go for him from time to time, because he had to hear that he was still discussing the whole matter with the speaker John Bercowe.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to withdraw from the style of politics "Punch and Judy", which was often associated with PMQ, but several years later he agreed to go down.
Since its first issue in 1990, PMQ has been seen as the key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership and their position among other MPs, despite critical arguments that they have become charikatures and require remote refurbishment.
"Focation in Joburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homelessness.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn something and make themselves alive.
"I've been photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to make photographs of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

JD Sports stopped by 3.1% after the sports company reported 83% jump in half a year in the profits before paying £46.6m
Chief of JD Sports says higher brains could damage expansion
The Executive President of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that the higher minimum wage for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "more purchasing power in potential consumers' pockets."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would overestimate the higher cost of meat in his company, he suggests.
The costs could include plans for the expansion of JD Sports, which could mean less new jobs.
The Prussian habitats are encased.
Controversial building got a stop.
Investor Prague Progetti e Investimenti considers the infringement of the decision to oppose and will appeal against it.
Against the building that is to be built in the close proximity of the Anjeska monastery in the centre of Prague, they protested in front of Prahy's office 1 hundreds of people, and the polls.
The Magistrate in the Decision found that there was a breach of the construction law, because not all of the merits of the territorial decision were met.
"The subjective territorial decision does not include, for example, a kind of land, distance from neighboring buildings, sufficiently clearly and clearly described form of building, restricting the territory affected by the impact of the building," he writes in his decision.
As an illegal master, he also considers that certain basiss for the decision have been issued to the original issued documents which have changed.
For example, it's about the position of environmental authorities.
Part of the building should be set up on the ground by the National Gallery, but the investor does not have a payment agreement.
However, it appears from the written material that, however, the owner of the land has submitted only an agreement with the project documentation for the land management, not with the installation of the building on its territory, the construction committee writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Razetta from the investment firm, the construction board did not take note of the decision of the Authority - the Ministry for Local Development, which indicated that the duration of the study had already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seven years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press report.
The project that people are experiencing due to the proposed color of fascism is a strong emotion in Prague.
In the city center in the past, hundreds of people gathered in protest against the building.
Associations and residents of nearby homes are saying that a certain permit was issued many years ago for a house that had to look different.
They also criticise the unavailability of buildings for the historic centre of Prague and the uninterrupted neighborhood of the Anjek monastery.
The house proposed the architect Zdeněk Franek, the project changed several times.
The original project form, which was calculated with the revised phase, rejected on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Constitution (NPU) of the Ministry of Culture in 2010 and cancelled the permit of the Prussian Memorialers in 2010.
The new project of Prague Projecti e Investimenti with windows made of faces but the NPU and the Magistrate Memorialers accepted and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the wastes of the resistors, never counted with the façade in the pink color, which gave the project a review after the red wine.

On his way, he took with him three Syrian passengers who wanted to drive about six miles [half km] away.
At the time, according to him, it was not yet criminal in Hungary, he said to Lid's newspaper.
We knew that the guards of the law would not be able to do that.
But when the police stopped us, they arrested us for our surprise and transferred us to the investigation department in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
He spent nine hours in politics all the time.
The police were right at first, but they were able to communicate because they didn't have a lot of English.
However, the relationship he said was sad.
For example, in our goal of measuring about three times four meters, 15 peaks from Syria were pushed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were closed the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them had understood what was going to happen to them, entered Berg.

Metcash is launching a campaign on the outside to fight invasive Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trade from Aldi's efforts in southern and western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign on the outside to fight invasive Aldi
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food providers and will be an IGA brand through marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are added with signs such as a dunsborough based ice cream maker Simmo's offering discounts in IGA stores and shop owners sell discounts on the Australian football league to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors celebrate their annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the market because southern and western Australia represents about 30 percent of Metcash IGA commercial steps and generates a higher deal than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA trades enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
In any case, an analysis such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi is about 5 per cent of the food market in these two countries during the 12th months since the opening of the first trades that took over markets from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analysis, Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, suggested that the IGA retail could spend 360 million dollars on annual sales and Metcash 250 million dollars at the end of 2016.
This proposal is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 trades in South Australia and 30 in the West during the next year and will generate sales of 500 and 600 million dollars on individual markets.
The loss of food and volume in a solid price base of Metcash could be estimated at around $13 million on the amounts before tax, confirmed Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost its share of the markets in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Cole, although recent research by Roy Morgan found that the buyers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sale of Metcash food is 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share decreases from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week's leading manager of the Hamish Douglass fund, founder of the financial group Magellan, said that business events in Melbourne could probably disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comment.
But we know that a member of the Metacash presidency contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA fell from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the profits from the Metcash food trade, which provides about 1200 retail IGAs , have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of speculation because sales and outputs are under pressure.
However, large sales went to the counter and invested more than 150 million dollars annually in order to adjust the retail prices in Cole and Woolworths to hundreds of products each week and thus help IGA to re-enact trades by adding fast-growing food and newspaper from individuals.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrise, says that the price comparison and supply programmes catch sleep and hope that the large product will return to basic profit growth in 2017 first in four years.
Thanasi Kokinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healym
Thanasi Kokinakis deserves more honor than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a further loss in the recent habit of his friend Nick Kyrgyos and deserves to be praised for his conduct rather than criticism, says President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented two often called "Special Ks," was distracted by the unexplained attention of a fair with a well-known Kirgios and Stan Wawrinko at Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a campaign of qualifications in Cincinnati, Kokinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be split up twice, Harrison then declared, "Wowrinka had one attack on Kyrgyzstan and I had to attack him too."
While he was the last to see how they broke the rocket after he was hit by Richard Gasquet's possible acquisition of the U.S. Open, Kokinakis was constantly defending Healy.
The youth is currently located in Glasgov, where Sam Grothem competes for a second-hand location for Bernard Romance in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I thought deeply about the fact that Thanasi was bound up in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He lost his rocket when he was playing for a race in the United States, but he's not the first player to shoot himself because of frustration on his rocket. I know Thanasi's pretty well and I can say that this is not going to happen.
But he really did well because in the US he was exposed to very provocative circumstances because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated some hard.
It's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard, and he's in the team, and so far, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected, he's practicing hard, he's in a wonderful condition, it's a very stable and successful young guy, and I just think he deserves to be close by his own actions.
Healy also supported the decision to look at Kyrgyzstan for an important strike that begins on Friday, stating that "a mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports a Canberry family to return to the team as a long-term chair.
"First of all, we want our team to be just focused on the game and not on all the controversy around it [Kyrgyos]," says Healy.
And I think that Nick stood up very quickly, as Federer, Murray and others show, in public eyes, he also made a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time after he's able to think about it, it's in my opinion the best solution for him and for him himself.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, ends borders and keeps migrants
After notification of the situation of the threat of Hungary in the afternoon, its southern border closed with Serbia and those who tried to break it illegally were stopped to stop a large number of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country, and Serbian authorities responded harshly.
Those who have lived in an unknown time on the sands of the land between the two states are the ones who flee in the face of violence in the land of their homelands.
But there's a sense of frustration coming.
When helicopters pass over them, migrants call together "Open Borders!" and provide an order unit of Hungarian police.
Some people refuse food and water at the protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declares it was "reliable" to send the refugees back from Hungary, while they continue to come from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbsko) wants to be part of the solution, not just an improbable occupation.
It will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries during the next days," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The problems at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the block of 28 states did not come with a single immigration policy at further meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40 000 people seeking protection in the wonderful Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year, which would take more than 120 000 others, including Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Rakousko announced a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental crisis.
Hungary, however, did not rely on Brussels or its neighbours.
The external threat situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to resolve the crisis and allowed them to close the road and speed up the trial cases of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a ship from the rest of the road along the border with Romania to stop the obstacles that are trying to cross their country when the ship is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News co-rapporteur Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to attract the rest of the route between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main obstacle and I will enter the European Union for refugees from Syria and other countries of the Middle East.
However, the president of the government, Viktor Orban, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are better alive and not war survivors who are looking for protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force on Wednesday night in Hungary now criminalize the breach of a 4-metre radius that the government has allowed to establish on the southern border with Serbia, and it also provides for further lengths in prison for those who have been illegally transferred.
"Thanks to the situation caused by the mass migration of Hungarian government, the situation is threatening," Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
In this we have a very clear understanding: illegal cross-border crossing is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must continue to accept the establishment of the arms expected in the coming week, but the Associated Press reporters on the border have observed heavy armed forces with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, adviser to Orban for domestic protection, said the authorities had captured 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been captured in the State's territory.
They have been helped to damage the plane and are now in police custody accused of breaking the procedures under new laws.
The authorities quickly let the plane settle.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two out of seven border crossings with Serbia in the morning after using a train covered by the rest of the road.
At the main border crossing in Russia, the Chaos emerged because the Hungarians opened a small office in the military container for processing and causing pressure on people.
About 20 took them inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of sprinklers blocked the main distances connected with Serbia and Hungary by refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross borders to Hungary.
Volby 2016: Hillary Clinton's step ahead of Bernie Sanders decreased by half in the national vote
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit strike in the Democratic National Nomination Institute, but Senator Bernie Sanders is taking her shot.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the democratic primary voters (58 per cent decrease), while Sanders is in second place 27 per cent (7 per cent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has yet to know whether he wants to be a president, will receive 15 per cent of the support of democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, the most democratic voters claim that it is too soon to say that they are clear decisions that the candidate will support.
But the Sponsors of Clinton are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From a CBS News survey last month, Clington's soil was lost under foot in several demographic groups, while Sanders had several.
Clinton keeps a big gap between women and tends to slow down, but her behavior is slow.
Her support between the men was significantly reduced and Sanders lost only 5 points on it.
Clinton's exit with democratic voters under 50 years of age and now they're equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit jump in front of Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders lost only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in the entire states say that they would strongly support Clinton if she became a candidate of the party.
The fourth would support it with certain benefits and another 15 per cent would only support it because it is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that Clinton's contemporary allies are particularly upset about her.
The views are mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the present time - only about a quarter would support it.
While 48 per cent of democratic primary voters say that they would support Clinton, less Republican voters also say about their favorite, Donaldu Trumpov (35 per cent).
When Clinton's candidates are asked in an open question why they want it as a candidate, the most common answer is that he has the right experience (16 per cent), that time has come to be the president of a woman (13 per cent), and that he is the best candidate for this job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The next is a great choice and agreement on problems.
While Vice-Presidents consider the potential candidate to be a president, 57 per cent of democratic primary voters would wish to do so - a third of them again think that they should not.
When the primary democratic voters were asked who would choose as the second vote for the appointment of the party, the most common vote was Biden.
Among Clington's fans, more than half of Bidena's as their second choice, far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for the appointment of Democrats, the leadership of Hillary Clinton will be extended from 20 points, if Biden will apply, to 30 points without his candidate.
Fifteen per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
Being in this range is far different, but the percentage of people who see it as the most likely choice is rising.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of greater importance for the candidate, democratic voters give priority to solving problems before greater opportunities for elections.
Like last month, not one democratic candidate or potential candidate does not appear as an unfriendly candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among their parties.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Being of all three leads to honesty, while Clinton is a strong guide.
Thirty percent of the democratic prime ministers do not think Clinton is honorable and reliable, so twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent of them do not have this view.
The leading democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological views.
As far as all these measures are concerned, perhaps the fourth democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions regarding Hillary Clinton's decision on the use of her personal e-mail and server as a state secretaries continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation of this concern and say that their overall view has not been affected at all.
But among the American public, it's quite a different story.
Half of the Americans are now upset with her explanation, while only about a third is calm.
Public views on this topic have already been divided in the spring, shortly after this problem has been identified.
Most Americans claim that this emial controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 per cent of their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
It's mainly about the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim their views on Clinton have fallen.
Although Clinton is considered to be a honorable and reliable member of the party, this question remains a problem among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent sees it as a honorable and reliable one, which is a decrease of eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think they're honorable and reliable.
And 55 per cent of registered voters throughout the country also do not see Trump as a honorable and trustworthy person.
However, Clinton and Trump have good guidance.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best they could do.
Sanders sees more people as honorable than bad, but, just like Carson, a lot of voters didn't take a look at him.
The failure of the 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ended up behind Donald Trump in the national elections.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the candidates in the latest survey and the others are not accepting support.
Interests from a number of Republicans throughout the country continue to support the Trompa tree majority, and 23% of the aid was released in the latest CBS study prior to the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the afternoon.
But Carson fired from 6 to 23% at the same time.
The study also found that Carson is leading well against demographic groups, and it ranks Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The remainder of the field with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the state government of Ohio John Kasache, was completely supported by the current 2% support of Scottt Walker.
Former Governor Floridi Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in the third place with 6%.
The failure in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest study is plus less than 6% and has become worse.
The latest CNN/ORC study published last week showed that Carson improved and reached 19% of the aid between the Republican and Trumpo 32% of the aid.
A recent study by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In the ongoing trend, Carson decided that Trump should be exposed to neurosurgery in the service, and even Carson apologized for the allegations of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the campaign in Iowj.
Five members of the brotherhood were charged with the death of the first-year student Baruch College
About two years after the student died during a brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountain, Pennsylvania, he was charged with murder against five people.
The New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michaela" Deng during the beginning of the order in September 2013 and later took him to a hospital, which contributed to his death, reported to the police.
The police state that he had eyes attached to him, had a full-fledged dog on his shoulders for 30 pounds, and was again loaded when he tried to reach the target of the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally got into his head pain and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Psi didn't call 911 immediately after Deng had spoken about it, and apparently waiting for an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found time to move Dengo's clothes, to overcome his symptoms and to contact Andy Menga, the president of the whole of the brotherhood, and to ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner brought him to the press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide the equipment and basically gave priority to the welfare of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't get back to life and died the next day.
According to the questionnaire, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object into his head, body and foot.
"In addition to many families, there has been a wave of persecution in the brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year because of persecution since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Dengo's family, in a statement.
The brotherhood and its members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The great rapporteur, Monroe County, recommended the murder of a third-level officer for the first five members.
Thirty other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of the attack by the prosecution and criminal association.
"We want to keep not only the participants, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or informally, we also call them responsible," Wagner said at the local press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood broke down its relationship with the local branches.
This happens when Fed increases interest rates
The growth of the rate will come and the next market will be fragmented, the long-term benefits will be rising and the economy will be able to slow down.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will last.
For the economy, the history of the small source of time offers it.
Recess came 11 months after the first increase in the rate and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal reserve system in increasing the rate is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why the officials of the US Central Bank highlighted so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the increase of interest starts, but rather on the trajectory how long normalization will take place.
There's really more change in the game.
However, in the end, the members of the market can be assured that any trend due to an increase in speed can be overcome.
"The first increase in Feda since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted to some as the end of the era of 'low money'," said Julian Jessop, leading the global economy of Capital Economics.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of American interest rates to the most common but still low, to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means it's going to happen to adverse effects.
Here is the view of how some areas of the economy will react on the basis of historical trends:
In view of what the market has recorded in the last about a month, the expected increase in the rate may make the air somewhat unstable.
But as soon as the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for re-stopping action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may also reflect a shift in the mechanistic policy," the Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed's rise.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years is often the largest - about 14 per cent - measures to increase rates in the range of 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 per cent) and then returns to the normal state after 500 days, with an average rate of 14,4 per cent, according to the recent analysis of Boba Dolla, the main share strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock has a tendency to become more pronounced later in the rate increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recess is a fact of economic life, but increasing rates often help her.
At the present time, Fed is facing certain conditions that have not existed in the past and which could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable thing is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in history by increasing the rate of Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the year 1950, the rate increase was only twice the nominal growth of GDP by 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, it was 3.6 per cent, the small to expect its maintenance, while in the third quarter it was only 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Fed.
Increasing the rate in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "Is this time different," Deutsche said.
The market participants were prepared for the growth of Feda throughout the year and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which concluded this week and ended on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that FOMC could accept growth at this meeting, future trade only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our 1950 study, all the boosting cycles were in the supercycle of increasing the package effect with HDP covering tops of the start of the recession very quickly after the beginning of the regulation," the report says.
On the contrary, this was a very small recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far from the last time Fed was waiting at the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now 74 months and we are still continuing.
The real result was also volatile, since the market expects a rise in rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the shares enjoy.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in letters than in shares when Fed changes policy direction.
In the long term, it appears that the results of the change in direction are immediately after the first step in the growth/reduction cycle.
At the end of the growing cycle the debt benefits are immediately due," Deutsche said.
Strategists Charlese Schwaba believe that increasing the rate leads to a close approach between long- and short-term debt rates, which makes the gap even worse.
Longbooks with high performance often work better in this climate, even though "we're still careful about generating performance," said Kathy Jones in his analysis, a strong analysis of fixed debt in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed's policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation's expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to a more precise policy of currency," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the tax deficit is broader, the credit gap has widened and the volume has increased - all market characteristics as Fed accelerates policy.
It is generally said that companies that carry out most of their business in the United States win the rise in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
The international community will face a lot of debts, as the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market area and their debt will also increase.
"Historia shows that "quality" action tends to change within three months after the initial increase of the rate," the analyst Goldman Sachsve said in a report for customers.
With strong balances, the firm has led to weak development companies in each increase in the levels in 1994, 1999, 2004 in the mean of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital outputs, as well as low-voltility ratios, have also exceeded their thresholds by 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
It's going to be a big problem.
The company with a high percentage of moving interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Despite clean action games, consumers are also struggling with rising dollar.
The participants can also see their results through higher results, but experts have different views on how long it will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Ambassador Andrew Bingham
Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham has criticised this station for "inculcating"
The view remains that the longer it is obvious that it's more than its commercial competitor.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and says they're just subduing the British.
Miss Damien Collins attacked the Voice and says he's not the original idea
BBC Radio 3 has "change" in Classic FM, claims the previous messenger and collects a clean pressure on the transmission to show that they do something that commercials don't do.
The Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham also told BBC Chiefs that the public service station seems to be "inspired" and is still more comprehensible than its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like to use the word "inflicted"--but it seems to change to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, which began in December of last year.
BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be Britain under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that attack me when you actually just like what we already have on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charge with reason that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 wouldn't have been taught on any other radio.
And their commitment to live by music, and the creation of music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radia 3's commitment to finding new songs and introducing new works to the exercise is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Radio 3 Alan Davey regulator argued that it is now necessary to work harder to join the audience than ever, because the British are less learning about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only first production of BBC, which came under fire due to the suffering of commercial competitors during the expeditions of Culture, Media and Sport and were brought to the hearing of the Commission.
The Conservative Ambassador Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the price of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the show BBC1 - in which the stars of Palma Faith andBoy George as judges - were made "in a typical way for BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own state" when he's next to start a fun series.
However, he refused to order more future series in The Voice or spend money on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the lowest temperature from August and can be a Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth since the beginning of the year 2000
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago by mobile purchase
The expert believes that the November Black Friday could be a cause of rapid loss.
More than a decade was a virtual purchase on arrival, and thanks to it, many of the British main streets became the cities of the spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales presence, and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for the srpen represented the lowest growth from the year 2000 alone, with an increase of only 5 per cent compared to the previous year.
The panellists claim to provide evidence of online sales presence, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the level of growth over the past year and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always been rationalized," says Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG market index.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers began using their mobile phones to carry out purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, for example on the shop.
But now (growth) somewhere, and that's why it's supposed to be resuscitating.
The phenomenon of the Black Pocket, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
The Committee believes that customers could keep their purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average purchaser has turned to his computer to arrange purchases and then to match several sales site sites.
The Committee believes that the Black Friday, by means of which the buyer re-contracts, can keep customers from other purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was lost online.
For some products, such as television and practice, more than a third of the sales are carried out via the web trade.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of buying in stone fashion shops.
Muslims buried the victims of the falls of the sea in Mexico and the family of Bin Ladin was sentenced
29 dead bodies were transferred to the streets of Muslims during the first burial in Mexico
Saudi Arabia partially heats wine for the colapsion of the construction magnet Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health indicated that 394 people were also injured after the tsunami
Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of sea falls in Grand Mosque, Mexico. The victim's bodies didn't go to the street.
Dressed in a certain measure in white, tired, they chose the road and paid the price when the first of the falls arrived on their last trip to the Al-Moais.
The sad message went through a holy place, where a few days earlier the building of the lake had broken down the wall of the city and fell to the ground of faith.
The body was released for burial and the king of Saudi Arabia condemned the construction group of bin Ladin over a disaster that also left 394 injured.
29 dead after the fall of the sea in Grand Central Moscow, Mexico, were taken by streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, the Greater Machester, who was on his first trip when the lake broke.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of every year's nightmare.
The Saudi officials have already promised that as soon as they reach Mecca, thousands of people will continue to join the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the upper sea shoulder if he wasn't in service.
The Arab version of the statements, carried out by the Saudi press agency, indicates that Binladin Group is partially guilty of fraud.
The English service of the disk agency did not present this detail, but indicated that the heads of companies were prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to show what enabled the riverbed to reach the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were crossing before the Hadj earthquake later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the vessel's colapsion and were not made available to its representative for a comment.
The Royal Declaration also blamed the group for not using the most recent security measures and for lack of coordination with the meteorological officials.

Chief B&Q claims that Eastern European traders who are working for the left are already in a trend
The British still employ more workers, says Veronique Lauriy
The number of students from Eastern Europe is below the level of growth
The result is open 200 Screwfix shops intended for traders
Currently Kingfisher completes 60 B&Q flights throughout the country
He worked with Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for Daily Mail
Britons reject the goods and victims and hand them over to the European migrant workers employed to work in their homes
If it comes to you with a fake or malaria victim, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British continue to employ more and more traders to carry out the customs duties in their homes, according to the chief of the company for Srewfix B&Q.
Veronique Lauriy, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns his own domestic network, claims that there is no trend in the increase in the number of students from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices.
The result is that the Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Srewfix shops focused on traders and closes 60 B&Q flights.
Ms. Lauriy says she wants to hire more women in B&Q businesses because eight of the 10 purchase decisions in the trade make better half of them.
At present, most men's employees are male.
She said that there is a need to resolve growing demographic trends that represent more women's households, which are doing more household repairs than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie says: "We still have most men working in the shops.
We need to get closer to the equation.
In principle, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decision on purchases of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie, who is one of the only five women in the firm's headquarters under the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her spy team to reflect the balance between directors of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having a partial representation of women among employees including executive and financial managers.
Ms. Lauriy says: "It was a wise decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find a good woman we'd take.
Kingfisher announced a fall as in profit in half a year and then sold what the group took to itself the cost of closing trades.
The result of Kingfisher's trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
Prosinco's contribution to 600 crowns is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal complaints, it has nothing to do with human justice," said the president of TOP 09 Miroslav Godosek, who highlighted the principle of subsidiarity.
The President of the ODS Ambassadors of Stanjira pointed out that a single contribution would be good, but it would be better to be in standard valuation for years to come.
"We have space to find the mechanism we're going to arrange," said Stanjira.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaely Marks (CHSSD), which was to be assessed over the framework of the law next year.
Marks's argument is that it improves the social situation of pensioners, which does not depend on it.
The higher assessment of the next year would indicate the budgetary impact of 5.5 billion kroner and ministers are discussing each stimuli.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) recalled that in the past the rate of valuation has decreased.
Report Miroslav Opalka (KSCHM) warned that the proposal will not solve the reduction of real wages in 2016 and later.
Veto's right of payment in the complaint is clearly complex and possibly impossible, he said.
The President of the ČSSD Roman Sklenák therefore proposed a reduction in the length of time for the implementation of the standards in the Committee for 10 or 20 days, and thus blocked the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of two regulars.
Bonus should be able to go out at a total of 1.73 billion.
Money should, in particular, come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, there would be an increase in the average of the stock market.
The contribution should be made according to the new pensioners who will have a pension or part of it at the request of the pensioner.
They could find him, and those who lost him in a search of money before her release.
However, they would have to request the supplement in writing, which is no later than the end of the next year.
The incomes in Czech are regularly valued by winter, and this is about price growth and the growth of real bears.
This year corresponds to a fine of 41.5 per cent of gross fraud, which should be 40.5 per cent next year.
In the current state debt, the loan was estimated at 314.7 billion kroner according to the national final account, which was a total of five billion dollars a year.
The sales on the labour market represented 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all expenditure required by the law.
The average full salary per month increased according to data in the national final accounts of 104 to 10.714 kroner.
The Czech social security administration has provided the payment of 2.4 million full cash payments and a total of 17,000 medium-term payments.
Jakkinin's abandoned plans for a political career, he's going to pay for his science.
The Senate had a billionaire, according to Russian media, so sure.
In the Council, the Federation was to represent the Western Kaliningrad region, whose Governor Nikolay Cukanov, as a candidate for the government, held his post in the Sunday elections with a view to his post.
According to Russian law, the senator is not a citizen, but he is elected governor of three candidates, whose name is known before the governorial elections.
After the election, the senator of three candidates will choose himself.
It was complicated for Jakkinina that he did not live in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by the law.
The Kremlin network for Jakkina found an exception with the fact that it is an extraordinary and full-fledged climber that does not apply to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The end of the Czech comedy Theory of Tygra.
The last cap in the head of the brain is the voluntary death of his tea, which has gained strength and patience.
Babička - Iva Janjurva discussed the life, old and buried.
Janov is clear that he and his wife, Olga - Eliška Balzer, are on a similar route.
Remember that he once had his own will and dreams, he wanted to live again properly and freely.
He is also getting back to the government over his life - and as a solution to his choice of escape from it, he led to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted a comedian form to capture a certain kind of relationship in which one of the partners doesn't feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that Bartošk's main role, which he had already worked with, was invisible.
Still, he was surprised by the early heretic who appeared before the camera after further interruption associated with reconvalence after serious illness.
We talked to each other three years ago.
I let him read the scenario and he said he likes how sad he is.
And he surprised me that he was obviously a busy sportsman.
He always wondered where he was going to sit before he hit another scene.
This time he walked on his bike, walked on the stairs, and even walked to his head.
And that's all in the record tropic veins, the director's undercover.
According to Bartoški, the former women will take the tiger to make a queen in time.
They'll get him some meat, but right now they'll close the door so they won't find him playing outside the palace on the wall.
And that's what we're trying to report to our film, he said it was here.
His wife, who can cause a mildly negative reaction to the monsters, stopped Eliska Balzer.
She's not just a negative attitude.
It's also pleasant, intelligent, empathy and thinking good.
But at the same time, he's an exorbitant and wants his wife to convince him to die, under the cover of Baygar.
The film parallels the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinky and Allenky - Tanya Vilhelmová and Paul Beretov - and the worlds of Erika and Pepika - Jiří Havelka and Jacub Kohák.
The film producer is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers from Czech television and Rozhlas and Slovenian television.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help the refugees in Europe.
The U.S. Internet company Google promised to provide up to $5.5 million (132.6 million Kč) to organisations that help thousands of passengers travel to Europe.

Azerbaijan has cancelled a part of Telić's visit to criticize the violation of human rights.
The Czech Ambassador of the European Parliament, UNO Paul Telicka, has abandoned the narrow fourth road to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have cancelled the official part of the visit today.
According to Telečky, this is why the EP resolution last week criticised the violation of human rights in Azerbaijan and was a telečka co-author.
In the decision, the Azerbaijani Party Telička presented the opportunity to speak with the official partners and also to visit political prisons, which depend on the agreement of the authorities, explained in a press release by its Brussels office.
The road planned a few months ago, Telečka wanted to use it to meet with Parliament's leadership and executive representatives and representatives of democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, to clarify the text sent by the ČTK.
The EP resolution condemns "unresponsible repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all policies, officials and judges involved in political monitoring.
The resolution was adopted shortly after a recent ruling on Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadidjo Ismail, who was charged with exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not claim to build its airport base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not assume that in the future the Russian aviation base in Syria will be established in Novosibirsk.
We don't have such plans yet.
But nothing has been released. He declared it.
Russia already has a seabed in Syria in Tartus, which has been used more recently as a service and logistics centre.
According to the report of the Russian press, since the beginning of the Russian military and military supplies to Syria have been stopped.
According to Moscow, the arms embargo arising from the payment of trade agreements.
Pentagon claims that the Russians intend to establish a airport base in the city of Latvia, which, in the meantime, remains the presence of Syrian President Bashar Asada.
However, Washington does not have a clear understanding of Russia's specific military objectives in Syria, the American commentators agree.
Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov on the situation in Syria on Tuesday, their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
The next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu comes out to Moscow to suppress the concerns of the gathering of the Russian Arsenal near Israel.
The White House speaker Josh Earnest noted Asada's support for the protection of the sword by Moscow.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria have been declared to be more unclear.
Moscow, according to him from Syria, made its satellite.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, it's not completely clear according to Earnest.
The campaign in Syria should be based on today's speculation of Russian press on the main theme of Putinov's appearance at the upcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York.
The situation in the Ukrainian Donbas is not acceptable for the Russian leader to speak out.
According to a report in The New York Times, the U.S. government does not exclude President Barack Obama from meeting with the Russian President during the UN session.
The views between the White House councillors are still falling apart.
The TASS Agency today, calling on the word of Kremlin-speaking Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet been on his New York City meeting with Obama.
Sezamic oil is used in breast-feeding, and the final helps strengthen immunity.
The good way to increase the presence of bladodonal non-saturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra pan-an oil.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when the seeds are harvested for the study.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of healthy diets, such as sugarcane.
Some extra pancreatic oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
They are precisely based on the Institute of Medical Information and Statistics of the ČR for several years as the most common cause of the death of Czechs.
I mean, it's mostly women's business, it's helping us get a lot of oil.
If you are among the lovers of the Asian cuisine, you should not miss out on you the olive oil, which is part of the original recipe for exotic foods.

Sesame oil can be used successfully in the liver, which is very similar to that of the cholera.
If people want to use all the health benefits that bring the consumption of this oil, they should pay attention to products from exotic foods.
Manufacturers from Asia often use mixed seeds that have more taste.
But the oil comes from all the active substances, Ladislav Hačecký, the executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, who produces the Pan-Panese oil used for students.
The company also manufactures fresh olive oil and uses extremely unscathed seeds of white cheese.
In an hour, our lion will be able to go out eight pounds of sesame.
The raw material shall be stored at a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for marking an extra panensic.
High temperatures would result in loss of vitals.
Sunflower oil contributes to the disease of the heart and the liver.
The Czech favorite between oil is solar.
A study by Jarmily Hamersk, who led to the University of Masaryk, revealed that he prefers it in a warm kitchen 43% of respondents.
In fact, however, it is not appropriate to freeze, but at 180 °C it is already starting to refuel.
It is better to use it, for example, on salads and is especially used in a diet that helps prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains the same high proportion of omega 6 non-inhibited fatty acids, which are the highest in all fatty acids, which reduce cholesterol levels.
In problems with the heart, attention should be given to the amount of fully accepted fat and calories.
For example, in one lake of solar oil is 62 calories, in the lake of river oil is 99 calories.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that there are much more suitable natural foods with viable substances than so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to freeze for extra pancake oil.
This sun will last the same way as a sesame and final 9 months.
The storage in the refrigerator is still longer.
Old oil is known, especially by the cold.
On the contrary, he didn't take a day off.
It's a sign that the substance was not chemically refined.
The total oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technical cap are used for such superfood, and thus the total oil is considered to be the most healthy of plant oil.
For this indication, thank you for the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 non-inhibited fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce the body itself and must be taken from food.
It is particularly important to accept omega 3 fatty acids.
A study of scientists published in the European journal has shown that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece spend 0.6 grams on it, while Iceland accepts 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Concomitant oil is appropriate to be classified into the food as part of a supportive diet for the strengthening of immunity and the handling of injury.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of rebellious membranes.
People don't need to use total oil fear, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil was found on the way to consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil was the best seller in the company.
He sells 500 liters a year.
People often enjoy one lie after the morning.
The final oil is not quite attractive, but powerful immunity, Daniel Vlček from the beautiful company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, they're the most popular nation of American fishermen.
One home there is 1.4 grills.
Worldwide, then, the most diverse competitions will be in the giraffe, which will only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even Chechnya back.
On the basis of consumer research on the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people did not complain about their lives.
Most of them then scream several times a year.
In order to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to repair the mass by mingling several hours before heat repair.
Which oil is the most appropriate and, at the same time, does it leave the health of the promotional substance?
It is generally paid that in the process of rinsing itself, it should be cut to pieces.
The team members agree that much of the oil starts to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra Panamanian oils also come about the body of a prosperous substance, which we otherwise obtain when we consume oils from the fats processed at lower temperatures.
But it doesn't mean that extra pancake oil will not find their use when it's cooking.
A terrible oil for heating, health and beauty.
When it comes to mass, experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately be producing a terrible oil.
I mean, this guy's gonna add a taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, the unique properties of raising the natural taste of food are identified.
It is also suitable for drying and heating, as it has a high temperature of up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures as one of the small oil stores the health of the prosperous substance, Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Oil company, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from the coal river.
The experts agree that the dangerous oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
Next contains a high amount of lithium acids, and is therefore effective in fighting cholesterol overheating.
Our body also accepts important solid acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the toxic content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidney.
Consuming dangerous oil also helps to enhance our external beauty - it also improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of the liver and helps care for dry and leg hair.
The chefs admire the use of dangerous oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it appropriate for the preparation of studied food, for example, when it is sweetening salads, but also for the warm treatment of foods.
So when cooking, it can be used immediately in two ways, by marinating and by taking care of yourself.
The marines of the meat and the fish maintain their happiness.
The preparation of the marinade must contain three ingredients: oil, oxygen and corrosion.
For example, we add fat to the apple's octopus, and we're going to get meat cuts.
The korning also provides a mass of sugar and oil preserves and provides the correct direction, according to Daniel Vlček.
It also adds that dangerous oil is ideal for marine navigation because as one of the little oils it can pass through the dark mass.
So the marinated meat or fish are ready to grow, how do they proceed?
Extra pancakes are marked by only a few cups to prepare the meat.
It's the same pay for heating.
Some oils are for this method of preparing a simple taboo.
This is especially true of lynched, concocted and river oil, which should not be burned at all.
You need to grow oil before you are on your own, prevent the burning of food.
The essential part of the shepherding is also the preparation of the Annex.
There is virtually nothing to be done with the grilled meat and the fish - the grilled green, the cooked bread, the light green salad and many others.
The heads of Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the Hotel of the Great Year.
You need it: • 1 ks brochve • 1 swab • 1 swab • 1 swabs of the shell • 1 swab of the salad leaves • 3 swabs of the rose oil
Add to the salad table a mixture of salad leaves with a dried hand, a lacquered cherries and a large chestnut.
According to the taste of salt and stop, you can also taste sweet chili and soybeans.
At the end, cover a few cupcakes of dangerous oil.
For exceptional taste, then you can taste the salad with a very well-encouraged mind.
Scleroded sclerosis: it is not only about medicines but also about patient's will to fight.
Scleroded sclerosis is a complex disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of professionals: neurologists, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, urologists, ophthalmologists, psychologists, psychiatrists and many other specialists.
It is not only about medical care, for example, for women with osteoporosis who need advice if they decide to have a child, for example, to take care of these diseases and social justice advice, to improve housing, etc.
However, this is not enough: the development of disability can affect the patient itself in a major way.
The longer he is able to fight his own weaknesses, the longer he can work, the less he needs to change his life-style.
As the doctors warn, passation of the patients leaves room for the disease activity.
For example, it has been demonstrated that regular movements significantly delay the time when the patient needs some compensation, such as hunger.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not react to various symptoms, such as the fact that the disease automatically leads to the end of the vehicle.
And that is why the Daj sai chance (www.bezmytu.cz) website, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Dej sys .
The most important person in the care of a patient with a diluent sclerosis is neurology.
In dilute sclerosis, it has been said twice that when the disease begins to be treated, it may affect something more.
It's because we've got medicines on a diluent sclerosis at an interesting stage when the neurodegeneration process isn't so strong yet.
As we move forward, the greater hope is that we will be able to stop and remove disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic General School Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with depleted scleroded rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of low-ends or imbalances.
It works with patients according to their individual needs: keeping the condition, improving the skin, strengthening the skin of the day, reducing kidney failure or improving coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific difficulties," says MUDr. Martin Kovári, a nurse of the Rehabilitation Clinic and the physical medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
People with disappointed sclerosis suffer the same difficulty, but it appears in each other a little different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always slow down its symptoms.
The movement activity also enhances the immune status of the body, which is in the case of dilute sclerosis requesting.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that the patients check everything they can, and that strengthens their safety.
"In the exercise, endorphins also flow and the person feels well after it," warns PhDr. Kamila résov of the Rehabilitation Medicines Clinic of the Royal Vinohrad Royal Hospital.
By affecting the physical page, we're acting on a Limbe system responsible for emotions.
That's how we get into mental and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it adds.
"Before these patients have been treated so well, we know today that they need a targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Body Medicine School Hospital in Motole.
The aim of physiotherapy is to make a person stay as self-employed as much as possible, including a working class.
So physiotherapy cooperates with ergotherapeutics to help each person receive compensation to keep him calm.
Many patients also need the care of psychologists or psychiatrists.
They're in a difficult situation.
When a serious illness strikes you in your life, most people will take it seriously.
They live shock, panic, fear.
He has to react to a great burden - a loss of health.
With this sick soul, we have to go after someone, not trying to ruin everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to conclude that even with disabilities, even a life can be full of life and that the dissipated sclerosis doesn't mean the end of life," says the psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertva from the Neurological Clinic of the General School Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prussian manufacturer Latecoere by the airbuss, the airport has not been airborne.
The flying product is a synod of precision and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that no one can now produce and process.
Still, according to the super-transparent, computered processing machines, car keys to keep the composers up to something as common as the mermaids are.
In the bubble, which reminds the oven of the sugar vat, the dishes are mixed together with the food of the hair parts that just came out of the cooling machine.
"No one has ever come to anything better recently," laughs Ivan Dubsky, the director-general of the Latecoere Czech Republic Airport.
In the area in the Prague Latvians, the former Airport is making a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world give the door to the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is in Prague, are also entering the first and higher classes on the top decks of the world's largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composers for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
The precision here is the main motive.
Maybe a moment's key lets the company serialize twice a year.
If there is a lack of control record on the yellow label, the Prussian competition should explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who are regularly running to find out whether the doors are made in accordance with the agreed rules.
The human mind, however, has not been fully built by advanced technology.
On one door to A320 is 1500 knots.
You've got to break your noses manually.
It's gonna take them two days.
And according to the sound of the falling cloud, they know if the net is already correctly broken.
Tolerance, where they move, is minimal.
The nest can come from zero to 0.13 millimetre above the surface of the aircraft.
It's a hole in the chest of human hair.
Checks will come to a series of trained maths.
When the controller passes the finger on a series of networks, he knows if there are any other tolerances.
Then we'll take the right eyebrow.
Flights before 1989 of the L-39 military air force programme.
Only in 1991 did not make one.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At the time, it was joined by the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the electoral procedure on the supplier of the required door for model A321.
The talks with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were then a small company that did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supplies," Dubski recalls.
The door to the American producer would remain closed if it failed to attend the 1999 International Conference of the International Aeronautics Association of the French Group of Latecoere in Prague.
I talked there about our cooperation with Airbus.
The other day she broke up with Francois, says Dubsky.
A year later, latecoer bought a Czech company and a strong company came with new orders.
In the year 2000, the installation of the part of the door for A320 was opened.
Three years later, the door came up for A380.
In 2006, the company set up a new Hall for the processing of composites for the Boeing Dreamliner supply.
Without Latecoer, we wouldn't be able to get on our own with this big ban.
Maybe we could do some work or some small part.
Partners want a delivery guarantee for twenty or thirty years, Dubski explains.
Loni, the Czech Latecoere, received a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit of 147 million dollars.
The exclusive position between the suppliers of the aircraft is not free.
Latecoer in Prague has invested 1.5 billion kroner since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications and qualifications for key employees.
Without them, the firm would not have built any doors in the airport.
Find certificates that manufacturing processes meet customer requirements, and in repeated checks it is maintained according to the Dublin million kroner.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and more accurate.
We need to train employees, supply the equipment and re-certify the entire process, the Dubski provides.
The company is now completing the process of packing the market and the kidney that restores available for human health harmful cadmium.
The task was obtained from the manufacturer, but then technology had to be adapted to the devices or chemicals used in Prague.
People from Boing will come, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll take the product to them.
They're also checking our lab.
One set of samples are tested by themselves in their laboratories and then compare the results with ours, approaching the way in which the collectors control it.
Remuneration is a long-term exclusive contract.
With the Prague race today, they stand up and fall in the production of embraters.
For A320, it shall produce half of the total volume of the door.
Reimbursing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complicated for the Brazilian or European producer.
It doesn't mean, however, that you could say any price at the door.
Part of the contract is a price gap.
This gives how many doors one will stand after ten, fifteen, of the same pieces made.
The price for the cube is still limited to a certain limit value.
We have to get to this price sample.
If we don't, we'll work, says Dubsky.
Half of the halls, where they complete the electric roof for the Airbus A400 M military plane, are still empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
Here, a new robotic line is built for the nesting and installation of the door for an innovative model A320 Neo.
It's speeding up and it's getting cold.
"It's a trend that the assembly will take place in the airport," adds Dubski.
The transfer has a secure future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have already ordered 3278 pieces of new model A320.
Only a few meters away from the opening line for the complete mounting door for the A380 top deck.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to cut down production time and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start in two years, says Dubsky.
In the meantime, however, the company must carry out the qualification tests necessary for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices at the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also involved in further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boing, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company, it is a huge credit when it is able to work in addition to the bulk materials," Dubski says frankly.
Latecoer, however, is available in Czech for the food of production capacity.
There's no place else in the airport, where they're sitting.
Before the French mother arrived, she had 180 employees.
Now they're 800 and they could be more than a hundred years old.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are to predict how many hundreds of new aircraft are ordered every year, there must be no fear of work.
Although he had orders for several years earlier, the mother company of Prussian Latecoere was responsible for the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to pay the rent.
Finally, Latecoere was able to talk to the main believers.
At the end of August, some loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors received an increase of EUR 57.4 million in the company by 37.4 per cent.
The company owes two thirds, then 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial healing came to the start of the harvest.
The company opened a new stock of EUR 222.9 million between existing shareholders.
The basic capital of € 280 million was thus raised.
At the same time, the whole group is suffering from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which divides 85 per cent in the markets.
The average increase of the ban is expected to be four per cent annually by 2017.
In the book of the Law, orders amounting to EUR 2.6 billion, which corresponds to the four-year production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can be re-examined after years on the carpets.
The Czech competition in the Prague Latvians is important for the group.
The group contributes 16 per cent.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign sub-group.
The envoys supported the vast majority of the State's oil taxes.
The change in non-increasing payments will lead to a State deficit of 427 million more than in 2013.
At the expense of the citizens' budgets, the government has a neutral impact, because the payments have to be higher.
In the previous year, citizens received 450 million kroner payments and a national budget of 150 million kroner.
Some 200 million kroner and a state of 66 million kroner went from the weight of an anchovy.
The novel is also calculated by increasing the rewards from the existing areas with an approved weight of 1,000 kroner per hectare per year.
Acceptance of these awards is still to be seen in the full extent of the city.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (CHSSD) told the Members that the cities are getting 14 million to 100 million crowns annually.
The higher tax rates will no longer be defined by the law but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The award will be re-calculated as part of the amount of the weighted growth and the rates for individual types of non-growths.
According to the Government, changes have led to a positive reaction to the current economic situation.
The ODS Ambassador Marek Benda, however, warned that the establishment of a fee by the government regulation should not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, in this case, Minister Mádka said that the tax is not taxed because the state is paying for the state's non-growth, which is the state's property.
Payments are granted only to citizens whose territories are seriously affected.
In the case of deep difficulties, three quarters of the city's money and a fourth of the state's will be obtained.
The same will be true in the event of the difficulty of radioactive Horns.
Part of the money you're going to spend on the money you're making from your hard work will be tied up.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to damage after pregnancy or in order to ensure the protection of the pension.
Today's proposal was criticised by opposition messengers who claimed, in particular, that it was harmful to the poor and the poor.
For example, Michael Kuchera (TOP 09 and the Oldest) warned that tax firms would no longer want to sponsor citizens as long as they are, because they will pay higher payments directly to the public budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget of the Minister of Finance," said David Kádner (Susvit) selected in the Austrian country.
Before the growth of unemployment in the Mosteck, KSCHM had protected the KSCHM Hana Aúlická.
Kádner and Aúlicka successfully proposed a new ban, Kuchera wanted to return the government to work.
In the original report, it is estimated that, according to the company's firm, the increase in wages is inevitable in the price of coal because prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
The main consumers as electrical or thermal should therefore not feel the price rising.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that active organisations will be able to compensate for increased profits by their efforts to reduce their operating costs, which would in particular mean reducing the number of employees," the government consents.
However, it argues that the increase in wages from employment is essential.
According to the report to the new Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is key that the Members know the conclusions of the updated energy concept and, above all, the decisions of the government on the limits of the burden burden.
If it's hard to bear beyond limits, then it's gonna have consequences for the state and the citizens, it'll raise.
The City does not agree with Mádek that the decision on the crossing of the border to the lower Czechoslovakian army should be lifted by 2020.
The limits below ČSA should be extended, according to it, for reasons of social, national and long-term stability of nuclear energy.
Time to decide on the rates for the United States Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching how the American Federal Reserve wants to meet within two days in the middle and on Thursday to make a basic decision on whether to increase interest rates first after almost ten years.
In a survey of 80 economists released by Reuters, more than half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think that they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates between 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a historic event because it's been sitting for years since Fed's reduced zero rates.
First, we are approaching the situation when the main central bank could be able to get out of zero beams and start the process of normalization of level rates," says Angel Ubide, director of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The American economy has been relatively good, it has come to live in the same way as adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only low inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore less pink global perspective.
Markets were warned to be prepared to increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see a great chance against this step.
This Decision shall be published in the EEA Section of, and in the EEA Supplement to, the Official Journal of the European Union.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his friend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a statement stating that he was the first murder and that before he could take it back, they were sent to the local government office.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, announced that Lamb, a teacher of land and social science at Delta State University, called the police on Monday about ten o'clock in the morning
And he said he shot someone.
The lab asked him to send the police to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that in the house there is a "red dog", which will "no one eat," but is broken.
The police asked for the name of the calling, but Lamb didn't give up.
The Lamb didn't explain why she was shooting at the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss found a written report from Lamba, in which she said: “I am so sorry and sorry that I can take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who loved me."
After leaving the contract, Lamb set out for 300 miles on a long journey to Delta University, where he killed the teachers of the history of Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Thank you, William LaForge, said he didn't know about any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but that "in Mr. Lamb's head there was obviously something played."
In spite of the fact that Lamb had publicly believed in the romantic relationship between Amy Prentiss and Schmidt, government authorities indicated that there was no "no evidence" about "love triangle".
Shawn O'Stepen, who was with Prentiss' wife over seven years ago, admitted that she was "a great person".
The divorce came 15 years ago, but both remain friends.
The 19th-year-old daughter O'Steena and Prentiss were "cut off".
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald introduced, Prentiss worked from house to house via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, went with Lambe for about three years.
"She always wanted to help the others," she kept listening to Knowles.
The police indicated that Lamb spoke to his neighbors on Monday and said he was not going to jail.
When the police got him to the border near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the forest where he was shot.
According to a life-book that he published on the websites of schools, Lamb received a doctorate at the University of Delta in January 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Eye
Herec (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been behind him for several years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
Herec also had a known drug problem and was detained in 2008.
Of course, all these things choose their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months from the game due to a double break.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of right legs during the battle of Manchester United in the Liuse of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left turn left this injury in the ears and ordered it out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks that Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused an invisible break of Héctor Morena in 15 minutes when twelve-year-old Shaw went to the PSV space.
Nine minutes had been healed on the floor and the oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's had a double leg fracture and now he's in the hospital."
It will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then further served in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18, it's very hard, but it's fantastic and then it's going to happen.
When he was in the shacks, he also had a quill mask.
It's a joke.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in a group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a pentalum.
Dr. Nicola Rizzoli Mexicana didn't bother.
Van Gall said the Italian decision was wrong.
You can decide for yourself whether it was about the pental and the red card.
It was a very sharp break with both legs.
Twitter from Shaw's account says, "Thanks to all their reports, words can't express how I'm destroyed, my journey to rehabilitate is now starting and I'm going back stronger."
Related: Manchester Unit recorded Luke Shaw's injury in a fight against PSV
The English version will have added motivation to live in Europe's mercy in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It was a very serious injury."
If any player leaves the game with such injuries, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the goal of our players to shoot the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken foot in the siege of Mexico against Van Gaal of the Netherlands at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt the player, and when you hear of the seriousness of such a injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I wasn't able to survive this moment.
I saw only a sword that led to another direction, so it seemed to hit him [Morene], but I didn't see a clue to Luke.
In the SBS6 discussion, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
Player PSV Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smallinga.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
This is what every parent knows: When a child loves a book, it doesn't last long before he learns to remember it.
You can't be David Cameron at all.
On the question of child schemes providers to name a favorite child book, the president of the government of Lorax, a grandmother of Dr. Seusse from 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron wrote in a report published on the website of SuperCamps, and he continues: "Study, smart, creative and strong, I loved reading to my children, because it was always a picture or message that I had never seen before."
Well, then, in the following paragraph, Cameron specifically described the events of the book, as from the 2012 film, which added other positions and details to fill in the original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a dream where all nature ceases to exist, and even the air is comedite, a boy named Ted hopes that he will get the heart of his dreams, Audrey, by having her desire to see a real tree," is a special content of a book that mentions an object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
Jacoby was not alone, the text added by Cameron is read as a summary of the Lorax film, which is on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins the words: "In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a dream where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is comedy, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was open to a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would have met with the events of a book where the so-called young man learns that the local nature is developing a rough, studing industrialist One-ler, who is also going through the protests of the titled Loraxe, a narrow, booked creature, who "speaks about trees."
With the greatest likelihood of being so relatively small, a significant PR job got an assistant who never read Lorax's child 20 times in the chest.
Speaking Downing Street said the text was most likely from Cameron's staff office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without any further comments.
Adam Lyth was in danger of warning England, but he's still holding.
Coping with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England chose for this tour, I think it's going to be a 3-0 deposition that endured in the series of trials.
And I wouldn't be able to predict the reward of the guests.
The Alastaira Cooka page can be less tested than the three years ago, but there is a good spin player here in this sculpting system, and the collective thinking is strong; it is not just a youth’s positive language since 2012.
The sword is Moen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although it is unknown at the level of the experimental series, it represents an attack opportunity.
Consistency: Adam Lyth came out of England's team in a series trial and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lytha is a hard way for me to analyze because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were opposed to two good attacks under difficult and simple conditions, but the hard reality is that the cricket players are related on the basis of performance.
For example, by the name of Joe Root, there were no reporters, which led to the announcement, because — and this I have already introduced — players are their best selective.
A few more centuries ago, Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own judgment.
Let's hope that if he can get more running for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performance was not completely percentage, and it doesn't surprise me; it was always a team player.
The question of how long the pilot will get to show himself is a serious error.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Just Compton got a chance home and out.
The only thing you could think of is that England gave Jonathan Trottt’s first chance in the Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this missed opportunity is already past.
He's coming to Alex Halles, and it's a baker that I appreciate very well.
It's the x-factor player of the cricket that we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 on the throne of Trent Bridge, who did so little.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors had received, but of course this will depend on the entire system in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, when Moen starts on the side of Cook, which would get another extra spinner while holding four quicks, was overstated and I don't have a reward against her.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't breathe and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a great cricket player.
Moen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 for them and there's no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before his appearance in 2001.
Suddenly, three centuries passed, and he did not even look at it.
The team comes to Zafar Ansari as a base spinner, and when I had the chance to follow him, he hired me as a very capable young man.
People can look at his grave statistics — average 31 with a ball and 35 with a sword — and I see it as a pram, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the voters decided for young people.
That's a lot to learn about.
Despite the team, England seems to have made a number of changes and smart additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardenea, a pilot from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the experimental sports can be a mystery trap.
He is one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experience because they have experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of a tour of white-ball and brings to the team as energy, so unmerciful.
I've always felt that he was born into a world of international cricket, whether he's already a player or a coach, and just like Mahela, he has an intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the chat room, even though they are voices that are saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and freshen the atmosphere.
Player Colly's Durham Ben Stokes got one-off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Even though many disagree, coaches and electors do not create harmonographs.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken in a light manner.
The Brexit campaign could be a blessing if the economy is starting to stagnate by 2017.
An in-depth David Cameron's Renegotiation Strategy for the maintenance of Britain in the EU comes to other problems with every late day and without the choice of General Jeremy "Is It Yes or Not?" Corbyn to the head of the Department, or we will take TUC in the afternoon to the whole situation around Europe.
The foreigners also have their Corbin and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is involved in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-centered agencies, partial concessions and drastic changes to the treaties that most of them did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided not to do so even if they were in pursuit of social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor are going to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, take a picture before the famous local monument, with or without local audiences, and then return home with the words that they will win the union for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants an independent British in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - indicates that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a Germanly-equipped office, was a relative, but she was 10 years old and wanted to leave her post before she became a bad person, as it was in the long-standing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francouz François Hollande faces renewal or recovery in 2017.
His power also appears.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see how your legs are using Selfie Brits, who can invest their energy better in preventing Scottsko from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want because they have similar separatistic tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan intentional non-useable SNP-style notes during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a firm friend.
"Repetition has solved the problem" and "British has nothing to do with interpretation."
Europe knows how the Fleet Street can be and how skeptical about the EU are the prints of the oligarcho baron, because they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, who supported our entry in 1973 at 2:1.
They can recall the name Boris Johnson, the late Euro-portunist who made his name to the Brussels report "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his health, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of free tax gifts, strangers attracting phones and dogs of non-sea departments, which owned most of the major news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought of them the same, but he realized that if you ran out of fuel, you'd have to cook her bananas so that you wouldn't have dinner and then tea too.
In fact, Miliband was more than Blair himself than Blair when he mentioned Cameron's referendum from the time Blair adopted the principle of a breach of the EU Constitution, which was signed by the French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received a card of resignation.
The press never let it go.
But my dear Jeremy Corbyn, who called me in the Westminster afternoon, fell in love with me, and I told him that I should no longer spend time on me - it seems to be in danger of re-accepting the strategy of the fighter Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was still missing.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media commitment strategy, not with me, but with Andrew Marrem, whose baptism at BBC Sunday left.
Corbin's official position against Europe, I'll say it's nice, they're developing.
He claims he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people besides the survivors of the Ukip trend and the wild shores of Tory's little Englishism can definitely join.
That's what Hilary said "Bemm, but don't Benniite" Benn on the radio and television this week, when he couldn't get his inside scan to admit that Corby's abrasive name McDonnell was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his old father fought on television about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
The Hillary game was much more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benina phrase - according to all, it wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what the JC said to his colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday night,
Even if they are behind any, sensitive image Corbyn wants to share - don't forget, touch me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of full-time television transmission and especially in the faith, the paranoia and behaviors of which are social media.
It is fair not to grant Cameron a free access to Europe, which would allow him to consider supporting the Share Party in the referendum campaign on the matter of course, as McDonnell pointed out.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnel and Corbyn's basic statement on the EU's membership - in accordance with their economic, anti-capitalistic past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric debate between the left-wing dissidents, for which the Narcissism of the small differences is the central foundation of the dogmatic destruction.
Just like his exclamation about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their own masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspects - because of the British concession when it seems to be excessive?
The United States has already been quite driven from the poor British military operation in Iraq, Libya and Syria, as I was reminded at the afternoon start of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts critically review electronics published by Public Health England
A statement to the government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking has been received from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with tobacco industry, suggests researchers.
The Writing Committees in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet with the criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "mechanical" report last month and described it as a "complex review of evidence."
However, a number of researchers have lost data coverage and have warned of the relationship between some experts and tobacco industry.
In his professional journal Lancet, last month, he attacked the "extraordinary quarter base" on which PHE agency had established its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ have questioned the claim that was reportedly "based on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They argue that the public could expect the approval of the PHE agency, which says "the best idea is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people who are willing to develop a multi-criteria (MCDA) model analysis of their views on the damages associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the merger have been recorded in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose general director had previously received financial resources from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also agreed to trust public health BAT in the sustainability report.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting acknowledged funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding that was reportedly obtained earlier by Philip Morris International tobacco company.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain a number of well-known electronic cigarettes campaigns, some of which also announce industrial funding in the news.
Some others who attend meetings are unaware of their expertise in combating smoking.
The PHE meeting also participated in tobacco management.
The report in this group "supply consents," missing "firm evidence of the injury of most of the products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are recorded in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is still no evidence that e-cigarettes could be used as a way to burn children or girls," was earlier.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claim in BMJ was already committed.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking."
One of the two living dogs will die because of their addiction.
All evidence indicates that the health risks presented by electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what they do not show, especially when there was so much public concern over the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from failure related to smoking and smoking are NHS £2 billion annually.
The clear explanation of current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they are not just the damage caused by smoking - we are filling our national competences.
BBC should end with EastEnders, former director of Channel 4
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give right hand" for a tour show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should be used only for programs that are not created by another British television.
BBC criticised the establishment of public service programmes that would probably only follow a crowd of people, in the complicated times of sending off its rivals "more ratings show, and on channels like BBC4.
After general director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had failed to make an effort to connect with BBC for six years, which he worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that BBC will send and send programmes that would certainly be sent out of rivers without State contributions," Johnson said to the Committee on Communications in the Horns as part of a discussion on the future of BBC.
If you keep the license fees that I'm not sure if they're in the medium or long-term horizon of good thinking, you should reduce the creation of at least as regards programs that do not produce or otherwise do not.
They send The Voice in the main delivery time because they want to get as much support as possible in the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a funny joke, and it's completely pointless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why the regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed safely.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders next, and is intelligently made on the home floor.
Right next channel would give them the right hand.
I can't understand how these public service is.
I don't think it would even make the BBC worse.
Johnson, a company in the field of series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told BBC that he felt guilty of getting ratings "because of the ambitious people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show describes those who were executive director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003, to suggest that BBC sells shows as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the most demanding public programs of BBC services "are going to BBC4, where they are almost too often unable to measure the promise, but they are in addition to their right and they can argue when they agree on their cover-up mission to justify £4bn income from license fees, "But of course we do all those hidden programs that no one sees."
They send them out when no one sees them.
As for the license fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system with regard to who will get the best value.
Understandably, we all think that 150 British frees are a big sum each year, but for people who are 150 free a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look so much at BBC.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the Commission on Tuesday, said BBC should review its radial mission in the sense of "information, education and fun."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was already classified as a teacher - it was 1% television production and 0.1% in radio - and should be taken as a model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "information, explanation and fun."
On the issue of Elstein's partnership, she said that BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which were only broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
Sonogenetics or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound impulses influence the direction the lists move.
The scientists raised flowers with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Shortlists change direction at the moment when they are hit by sound impulses that are invisible to the human ear.
The pulses function to switch the cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
The researchers noted that these flowers are a great indication of the new methods called somgenetics, which use ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and act out of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, pointed out to the journalist Guardian that this method could one day restore a profound brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the patient's brains have installed electrodes that stimulate the brain. This method is used, for example, to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Hlisters usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction is delivered when it is located in the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles intensify ultrasound waves that then pass through the bodies of the worms.
Strong ultrasound waves occur in the iontic TRP-4 channels, which are located in the membranes of some red cells.
With sound waves, these channels open and activate cells that are connected, appear in the Nature Communications newspaper.
In order to control the lists using ultrasound valves, Chalasani genetically modified the reds so that some of their motor neurons contain the identical TRP-4 channels.
When he used such modified red ultrasound, the sound waves were strengthened by microbubulins and transferred to the reds where the modified motor neurons were stopped.
A new method of optogenicity is a multifaceted method that enables scientists to stop and extinguish neurons by means of light.
Chalasani, however, was left to hear that sonar genetics could have a great deal of benefit from this technique.
Unlike the light which must be sent by an optical train to the desired position in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the pressure without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can rely on human neurons and act temporarily on ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological disorders," Chalasani said.
He added that his use would also be found in the treatment of swabs and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your finger!
Integrates of the burning British arms trade.
See the video on the anti-arming market from Amnesty International.
A terrible killer drone!
The eyes on the legs that are handcuffs!
Three shots!
And the electric ignitions that cause unskillable pain, but they don't leave any feet!
The happy voice and the caricature of the metaphor leave no one to doubt that this advertising on the world's largest weapons is a strong paradox created for Amnesty International because of the desire of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security of the International Veselice in ExCel Centre in the London district of Docklands.

But the campaign is also known as the introduction of posters on bus stops and meters that require a different view.
"The important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using a letter with the sign of the London Metro with the DLR lines becomes a tank image.
This year, there will be a mass of arms dealers to join the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
On 300 posters are made by artists who perform their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismalland.
A collective name Special Patrol Group has helped distribute throughout London and with the help of "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per cube Allen key, which officially "have access to the top of the third advertising area of bus stop on the planet."
Transport for London is not a party to this airporting vandalism.
One of the advertising parades made by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavina Grindona, curator Cruel Designs and an expert assistant at the University of Essexu, artists continue to be increasingly confused and try to show political activity to the wonderfuls outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest camps and realize that they have to get out in the real world in order to have their art impact on society.
Other anti-trafficking complaints are health weapons travelling in the metre.
The video Amnesty was followed on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency that worked without a warrant for honorary and graphic designers and commentators were also free to work.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent advertising of arms trade - he saw an empty space in the ExCeL calendar - and he thought, "Show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They were playing with the creation of more realistic risk-making company ads, but "by adding fat colors and animation, I've aimed at getting more people to sleep."
"They took a fantastic cut of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools on the toilet," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is that the United Kingdom government takes action and ensures that it does not deal illegally with the torture device on our dust.
Almost the most creative art covering arms trade comes within ExCeLu, where manufacturers sell fantastic eufemistic products.
In a press report, Saab withdrew an order from the US Army to "on the ground of ATA4CS RS".
This includes "a single-made head that provides amazing effects beyond the burning within the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Student Life
11 years ago, I moved on to the student career as an unskilled nine-year-old boy, still believing in boats and moral relativism, but so far I have developed a deep smile of those whom I have led - and read, long-lasting difficulties on the other.
All I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The movement on the wheels can move from the nerve to the nerves of the next until completely detached.
It's kind of nice baseball: tell people where you're from, if you take a year's break that you're looking at Corbyna and why "you really don't really love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just a break from the HAHA, I'll be in peace."
Deep down.
And help others to get up too - ask and show interest.
It's a conversation, and it's gonna help you find people you like, and those you wouldn't even be playing with, even if your hair was in a fire and they'd be giving you hot appliances.
Let's just leave some space.
People's rooms are often changed to drinking receptions, places of film dinners and public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and manage lower work.
Consistency: Don't even think about getting to the top and being involved
Introverts on high will come soon.
Your room should be clean, although a lot of change in the myopo-pacian past culture, which is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendship.
It can be a trap for someone who needs to offer.
No culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a colleague is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a place of detention.
When it's about stealing, you're lying.
One boy in my tracks used to say that if the doors are not closed, he's called inside.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to dinner.
Because you started to go to the university at the top of the shopping malls, locking at a foreign door, and presenting with the paid chocolates seem to be less strange than saying, "Come in the neighborhood, I've got something for you, now I'm laughing while I'm going to ask myself personal questions."
Offering pets is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end by making your face fit for a fun surprise.
Of course, it's the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed bone marrow, sugar, and dust will probably ruin the rest of your sleep when you try to lock them in the door.
The theft of food is on the students' next regular crime.
Of course, the theft of the whole kitchen is a crime, but is the cup of milk into your tea?
Double-check it with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even when they're burning inside.
If someone steals something, it's disgusting and you have my sympathy - but try to handle it a little more mature than my roommate, who changed his milk in the middle of the night so that the thief would be in trouble.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make sounds that corrupt people from sleep or study.
It's not only about being a decent human being, but you're also the historical people in the houses.
The girl from my walk asked her neighbors if they could have a little rest of the door and bass because they were 3 in the night and she had a letter in the morning.
Their answer was to strengthen the song.
When they finally escaped at 5: 00 a.m., she left her sleep for two hours and then left her own music ring, closed the door and went to her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future dog walked on the same bike as you?
And on the contrary, would it not be very painful if you were to set up a social network for your future home, sleep together, split up and have to see each other every day and maybe take control of your friends?
Of course, you don't recommend - but if your sex partner's percentage isn't your future dog, at least try to talk to your weaknesses.
At the moment you realize that someone left keys in his locked room, there's only a narrow border between the play and the play.
A good girl is funny, but it's easy to make.
Teach them valuable and fun lessons about their safety by hiding something from them - never destroy any room of toothpaste and shampoo.
Shut the doors and give them the keys to the water that you're going to throw into the oven, but never swallow their stuff up more than twice.
Eve was happy for both and over the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eve survived a cruel moment of pregnancy with a seven - year - old widow.
His dad broke up with her, and she was on her own for the preparation and training of the offspring.
With the situation, I was able to solve quite quickly - I was very happy with the child and I was looking for the positive.
I'm not sure, and since I'm with the kid myself, I've tried not to get involved.
And I'm sure I hope we won't stay on our own for a long time today, reminds Eva of her first pregnancy.
She was already on the Internet at the chat room of the old Vashka who started talking to her about favorite movies.
Your Evu and Witek even brought home from the family, but he didn't care too much about his own father's role.
"For some time he got out of the program," Eva wrote in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The motivation of the third series of Czech TV series is just looking for luck on second try.
The Vítka and the family’s financial security were managed by working on part-time care and great help to mothers and aunts.
Even the views of responsibility for a foreign child at the end of your dedication to Eve were not reflected.
They definitely gave themselves together around Vítkov's other births, and this now understands Váška as his father and he also pronounces him.
Even though your daughter already has two grown daughters, she is a father in her 80 ’ s, and her children are also more responsible.
In addition to Vítka, there was a two-year-old Leontynk and finally two-year-olds.
"The greatest influence in our family has been so natural, perhaps even because my mother never talked to me very much about matters," says Eva.
A little space?
At least we're close.
The two Emma and Ella were born into a cysarean range after Evé was diagnosed with pregnancy at the end of pregnancy.
This is a decrease in the production and activity of yellow acids, which then lead to excessive amounts of fat in the blood and manifest especially with witness.
Poverty is dangerous for an unborn child, which threatens premature birth and death, most of the mothers after birth are self-restraint.
Emma and Ela were born to Evin and Vask's happiness, even though they were first in the 36th week.
The emica was placed in the incubator at an intermediate division, where Vaškov's non-terres, who was able to take over and move it.
Elinka was bigger and soon after she was transferred from JIP to the room, I had her in me, describing the period of pregnancy after Eva's birth.
The family spent twenty days until the doctors agreed to release the mine, which, inter alia, managed to reach the border two miles.
Waiting for children to be raised in Ewe's family was a joy, but it wasn't.
"I was mad at my wife and children," she recalls for a hard moment at the division of a four-year-old mother for six weeks.
She also considered signing a reversion with her husband, except for the unsympathetic access of one of the doctors.
But eventually, the doctors left Eva and two of them at home.
Events of four pregnancy and births sent ČT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45 p.m.
A whole starting family can be arranged.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to meet with an electric double and tight condition.
The house hasn't grown up yet, but your house has made Evi happy by mounting a gas heater so that the preparation of food for six more comfortable people.
If it's the worst, we're going to have a taxi.
Eva is convinced that children are especially concerned with family order and a pleasant atmosphere, not with the size or size of the house.
In the past, we had a lot of fun, better than we expected.
The order of the mountains is hidden in the small space, and we often cross the hill, but at least we're all close, laughs at Eva, who can find a positive page in every situation.
Your work in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes to the Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his seventy years, according to his words, care for the finances of the family and children physically governs how long it will be, but will it?
"I realize that in view of our age difference, I will once be the one who will live this family," admits Eva at the level of the question of the future.
She would like to go back to work, but she still loves her own business.
I don't have to work with four kids.
And when it's the worst, we can deal with the wife about the taxi, she's wearing a sympathic blonde.
Apple post i-o effect.
They can show up for everything.
The most effective processor, photoparate with greater resolution, stronger layer or display of the sensitive force, are in short order recently presented by the nine-generation iPhones.
The last two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The available trend of Applu was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than it was before.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose volume of sales increased slightly to the previous iPhones.
The two-dimensional volume of the difference in the dissuasiveness of the news was, however, really inevitable.
However, it won't be paid in the new iPhones.
In contrast to the London iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the volume has grown in a smaller model of 14 grams, and then more than 20 grams.
On the one hand, you can't be surprised, a low-frequency apheria in Apple's Capsules has been significantly affected.
The sixth newspaper is so far from the 7000 ’ silica silica, which has also been lost in weight.
But they have a lot more impact on her.
Apple also used 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to its display different touch strength.
This required a display of another kind of capacity sensors.
The volume of new iPhones' displays so slowed down by previous generations has increased more than doubled.
In less iPhones, from 12 grams to 29 grams, in case of greater than 19 grams to 40 grams.
The iPhone 6s displays the most difficult component to use.
The volume of only 143 grams is then reached in this newspaper and thanks to the detonation of the skin, which hit most of the remaining components.
The larger model is then the most difficult one to use, but its weight has never changed before.
And in this case, the greatest growth is just in the display.
The amount of 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
As soon as the new technology will be practical, it will appear until it is used.
The first users will be able to test it already on Friday 25 September when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus is started in selected countries.
Are the boots of breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglici, archaeologists have found an interesting opportunity.
This has revealed the stages of modern human migration from different times, including artificial furniture, the remains of tools, and so on and so on.
In the 23A category, which is based on instruments dating back to the time of the 30 thousand years before the fall, scientists have discovered something very interesting about the rest of the breakfast buffet.
On the other hand, there have been the stages of the ovaries that have apparently passed through the production process of so-called ovaries today.
It's the first place to go to her today, then it's dry, it's cool, it's raining, it's raining, it's raining, it's raining.
In the spring of Paglicci, it was discovered that it was burned or burned, and then was apparently broken between two millennia stones - at least this indicates the use of two stones in the lake.
Thus, the scientists failed in their PNAS magazine publication to suggest that in the autumn, the complete process of production of chicken would take place, but the similarity is really very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the wolves, but the idea that it was with some fluid and possibly enough heat, of course, is quite logical.
It is also a very interesting evidence of the intensive use of crops long before the agricultural harvest.
If the interpretation is correct, the oldest arrows were presented to the farm for twenty thousand years.
New report of the station in the Transport Underground City Brna.
So I once again voted in favour of the name of the stop in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Prizrak, Frazova, Sprateká.
Of course, the trolleybus was somewhat more thorough, so the vote by the male voice was somewhat less understandable than before when the remnants voted for the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper length of the transport movement, it is more distinct than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that these voters have chosen themselves to travel - I don't know who asked me, but they certainly chose from the studio recordings set up in a simple silence, which, of course, seemed quite different than in the framework of the bus engine.
I live in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all these remnants, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't know each other in Brno and for whom this report is primarily intended may be confused and may at the end of the wrong place, then claim that the statement they were to issue has not been reported at all.
Perhaps this choice of voters - but better revote voters - should be done again, and this time undercolored by the ordinary transport unit and the engine wheel, in which the hire of the producer in the bus is almost lost.
So we don't want to keep listening to the name of the Water Hershpic Station, Shmírova, or then Ponorna in the squeaking castle that I moved to Kamara.
I guess my old ears didn't sound so much in one day when the voter changed the silence.
That day, I understood that statement quite well.
Good morning, Mr. President.
From the files of the tractor.
Today, the minority knows what was the biggest and most obvious of the governments of the country, such as the complex audits.
I've allowed myself to remember that.
The bus was late.
I was killed at the diner's office at the time the radio found out it was just seven hours ago.
"You're lucky you didn't break up with the boss, came in a minute before you, and it seems like there's no right-hand," said the speaker, while I was writing to the book of futures.
Thank you, I'll give you a kiss.
You're writing to me that I'm going through the rounds on the audition of a small mechanism.
It's not going to work. They're checking today.
They're all out of this shit until it's gone.
What's that really about?
"But you'll see," the dispice broke.
Next time you'll be, too.
I ran away on the walk.
Then the main door was opened and the principal appeared.
He's drunk, with a stone face, in a perfect fall of the same kind.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I greeted him in a friendly manner, and suddenly two buttons of the same size fell off.
"Good morning," she answered, and I ran to the second floor, without knowing the student, the violent tone of the old man's response.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva to me, the older lady I loved very much.
She was even the principal before her friends met her.
They're checkups, and you're gonna get a cab.
I asked myself how many times those complex checks are, but no one wants to talk too much about them.
They've been together for three years, everyone has to go to him, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
But I'll see you first.
I got out of a bottle of fascicles with periodic reports and that phone.
"Here's Holcman, come to me now," the chief voice called out.
What's going on?
Now we met and nothing..." I thought, but no one answered me, everyone just with his thoughts.
"Good day, Mr. Chief, I came to your order," I regretted, and I soon entered the Chief Chief.
The chief sat behind the desk and looked at some light.
"Sudrewhu the mechanic," he said for a while, without raising his head, and still looking intently at it, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He walked out on the desk, got into the back of the chair, and, frankly, looked at me with a normal, unpleasant, bad look.
I found out.
What's going on?
Last night, the mayor praised me for working very well and for being at peace with me.
That the chief did a lot of good when he pulled me out of the range.
And now this?
I'll find out you're a road remote tech and you have to act on it.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I complained that I used such a greeting from childhood, that I was so raised, and that I couldn't see anything wrong with him.
It was like a red hat on the handle.
"You're on a socialist train and the only acceptable greeting is a privilege of work," said the superintendent.
And more than that, you're still asking for an explanation.
You're gonna say "Mr." And you're gonna say "sustain" again.
Just because I'm not a boss for you, I'm not a boss, but I'm a boss.
The tenants are the fellows of the tenants, the top traitors are the fellows of the top traitors!
Remember that.
I'm sorry, sir... I'm sorry to the Chief, but... but I greeted you with the usual public greeting.
But there's nothing wrong with it... and it's a privilege to work or a friend... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your priority that you're not on the side," the student sent the principal, who calmed down a little while.
But that's still going to be the point.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a debt to pay up here.
That wasn't good.
When the chief said something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good about it.
For a while he tried to seduce me with a study, a chicken look, and I was looking for the words I would answer.
It also saved me from his increased pressure.
He was just a couple of years older and played for the Lord, actually a symphony.
It's funny, focused, authoritarian, arrogant, as it was right now.
He's the one who's been shot.
Come on, he's the boss.
In fact, not everyone, the president of his party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-residents, said.
But the chief wanted a lot of people, especially those in whom he could use his sovereignty.
Right now, he's set me up for a full cow.
I thought something about the ass, and I'm still getting tired so I can't shoot it in his face.
I just wouldn't even go back to the dumpster, so I could keep doing the lovely officer.
What would I do with two kids?
And that's the barbaric!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy here.
"It's still all you can go," concluded the chief's audience and began to look back in the mirror that he had before in his hand.
They called me in half a dozen.
Everyone in the office was already there and asked questions about what and how, they answered, yes, that would be good.
Only Jozhin carefully explained how his habit was that all of us can't be deceived because the work would have to be done by the headmaster himself with his faithful, and that he is not afraid.
The word "sudrey" was also expressed as if he knew what my old man was doing to me this morning.
There was a great deal of excitement in the capital.
The Chief Justice, after his writing table, and in the long advisory table, other colleagues who were to decide whether or not to be my official residence.
Cádów, President of the ROH, secretary of staff, rapporteur for special purposes, something in a way contrary to the war, and the deputy, my chief.
And also the most important person, the president of the partnership organization.
I knew him from the street.
A ordinary trafficker, killed a pigeon or a saw of a shark's ass.
But it's also an ex-boyfriend.
It turns out there wasn't any shit with him in the past, a beautiful animal.
Bad language claimed he went to school in seven classes, he didn't learn anything, he couldn't do anything.
And when the crime broke out, he ended up in a dumpster.
But the jury, that's right, the jury was defeated!
The president showed me to sit down.
There was a little shower in me in the church. There was an uncooked shower.
Cádóvák read the case from the municipal council from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
It's a good time, I thought, and I've had a little better breath.
Then the prosecution from the street organization.
He copied the case from the municipal council, and perhaps both wrote the same person.
It just happened!
The parents of the long-term Member States refused to provide themselves before the audit committee and subsequently released from the party for health reasons.
The chief looked at me carefully.
He looked at it and stopped reading it.
The president showed him to go on.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and I was appointed as a candidate of the party.
Regardless of the parents who emerged from the side, the side gave me confidence.
I just got married and had a wedding in the church, except for the National Committee.
I failed to trust the party in the worst way.
That's why I was cut off from a number of her candidates.
But it didn't work!
I let both of the children get baptized, and even my mother, when she died, made church funerals, even though she was a former member of the party.
That's where I'm giving you a very negative position on the lead side.
When the frame was counted, only the opening of the main complaint to the desk interrupted the heated silence.
Everyone looked at me carefully, and I wanted to be far away somewhere.
At the same time, I was still in the spirit, repeating "Communist, Communist, Communist." To what did I get it?
Why didn't I stay in the kitchen?
I was able to repair the exits without any separate checks.
But now?
The attractive officer's career took him before she started.
Go back to count?
It's probably not going to work. I'm sure my boss's coming out in an hour.
"The judge, how did you check out the ordered company?" said the chief of staff interrupted the question on the frame.
Well, according to a review from the previous employment.
Do you have him here?
The camera wasn't obviously twice.
On the dark side of the road, he was nervously sneezing as if he had been checked himself.
He's got a sharp eye on him and gave him some paper to the chief.
"No," said the chief with the sign of the celebrity, which was often a prelude to the storm.
For the first time, he praised himself, studied industry, worked as a carpenter, and met the standard by 20 percent.
It's just the basic treasure.
From where did you take the sentence, mate?" he turned to the frame again, who felt that it was starting to turn against him and that he would be too soon to be a framer.
This is where my cousin gave it to me at the entrance.
That's enough of you?
"Well, when he came up to us, he went up to the corner to read," the black hat.
And there's no need for questioning, that was more like it, so I gave it to him.
"So when you were assigned to the technical function, this paper was delivered to you," the chief said.
The guard was nervous, and he never had an answer.
"It's okay, we'll do it later," concluded the chief's concern and the framer's obviously dropped off.
He's been up for a while.
"So what about you, buddy?" the chief turned to me again.
It's my turn, so it's over!
My eyes were closed, my anger burned.
He was following up with the charges and I knew that I was the most powerful creature in the world who doesn't deserve the least commitment.
By supporting the incomplete investigation, I put it in the error of the company of the frame rapporteur, while I didn't understand why the case was incomplete when I got it from the framer in the factory.
I am also an antisocialist, who, during the construction of real socialism, supports the ranks of religious darkness, yes, even their participation.
That it was a lot of what I've been saving, or maybe I'm still sleeping, and I prayed for relief to finish it.
I already had one.
I had one thing to do. I'm gonna get out of the mechanic's place.
I had one thing to take with me, too.
It's work for honest and obedient people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the Chief Justice.
"That would be enough, Mr. President," he called on the chairman of the party immediately and seriously interrupted the president's levitation.
This is where the judge made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he made a mistake!
He's already got his punishment!
Don't forget it, Chief Chief.
What could be worse for a young man than to close the door to his side in time!
To open it again, he'll have to prove that he's changed that it's our trust's time again.
An uneducated bastard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so short or he's sloppy out of the party school and he's meeting?
That's why this young fellow must also get a chance from us!
The chance to prove that he's changed.
And who's gonna give it to him if it's not you, sir?
It is your duty to support this young, true, sometimes misguided partner in his efforts to fix it!
It's your foreign duty that no one can save you!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us as well.
The judge here has to see that he hasn't forgotten on his side.
It's like a kind mother not only punishments, but it's also loving.
When the president finished, no one even heard.
No one's ever expected such a situation.
At least I do.
"I just agree with you, Mr. President," the President kindly urged in an attempt to resume the initiative.
If you'd let me talk, you'd have heard that I was just heading to such a conclusion.
They were all in agreement, but they had to see that he did not believe in the word.
"So I was certified for the role of a self-referendent on basic means," I got back to the office and I broke up.
Except for Evy's engineers, everyone was at lunch.
That little girl listened to my independent presentation of pure experiences, and I was comforted.
When I finished, she asked me if I'd give her coffee.
Before she waited for an answer, she put water on the fire and picked up the fences.
In the meantime, he talked about framed practices.
As a result, often full praise is given to a man in his hand, and the other in which a spy is sent to a new employee.
I just didn't end up where I had it, but on the street in the trunk, so the company from the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our camera?
He's getting old, where he would eat or drink, and then it ended up like it happened.
"That's from the old shirt," she said violently.
He's definitely not gonna miss him today.
Just take care of him, he's smart enough.
And the president of the party?
Basically far worse, no human being.
Null from a pumpkin with a great power.
The water on the coffee began to flow, and the office was filled with freshly baked coffee.
I went into a box of sugar, and the milk was milking a hot medicine.
I'm probably from the worst outside.
I'm not getting out of here now, and other checks are up to three years ago.
Anyway, my chief's fate just doesn't remember this day.

A symbol of the people's lives.
Around the windshield over Chlum again after years.
It's far away because it's located at 50 meters high.
People from around the world call him "The Winter on Chlum."
For the population of 150, it became even one of the first of the present sign, which was made available to the generation of parents in 2010.
"We then asked for a sign, and of course we wanted to have a sign, everyone knew it," said the old man Jiri Masek.
Chlum's windshield is a local technical memory.
It's a little bit of the current: it reminds us of the time when more people fought about quality drinking water.
This in Chlum in the past has been a priority.
By 1910 the clumsies were decided by the representatives of the solution, which was then expressed up to half of the 1980s.
In the village in the district of Chichov, they were allowed to dig seven meters deep.
Three years later, the studio was completed with a windscreen, which led the water to the reservoir in the highest point of the village near the upper church.
"The staff carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic to Moravia at the cost of 2,400 kroner," says a memorial note on the ground-building of the steel structure.
Several repairs and damage to the windmill were completed in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new water-fighting chapter began to be written: that day in Chlum started to serve a new water source.
The windshield has already remained only a non-functional symbol and more rare.
The Dominant was executed at the age of parents.
By 2008, Chlumštė decided that the wind cycle would reimprove and reintroduced.
They left to make the original car refill - reduced to about half a meter.
About a hundred years ago, however, it had to be cut down.
However, the replication manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the cycle could not produce windfalls.
Afterward, the chlum-dominant had been resting under the roof for several years.
However, since the summer of the year, the cycle is again on high ground.
In the case of a parent’s flock, the farmer allowed the car’s tail to be repaired and placed it again on the top of the railway line.
But the cycle of drinking water from the studios is just in the dark of a dark frame.
And over the years, we completely rejected him, because there were few water in the studio.
At least it was empty.
"On the floor, he built a wind car from the wheel in his pocket again," explained the old man, Masek.
Chlum is not the only town in Česk, where the wind cycle has reached the present sign, however, is the only one of these species throughout the universe.
A similar first in the mark is made up of local technical monuments such as Chvalkovicí and Green Mountains in Vyškovk, Kuželov in Hodoninsk, Parttuvić in Prerovska or in the Police in Vsetínsk.
It's okay, but I don't know Lafata, she admitted to the opposition of Tripoli Goian.
"The anti-Slavy game I remember very well, and my head, like everyone in my career," said 34-year-old Goian to a pre-fabricated press conference.
This time, George Hagi trained us, it was a shame we lost.
I'm hoping I'll get the head right now, Sparta.
Only with the distinction that we won't win this time," Goian continued.
That's the man who collected 60 calls for a Romanian representative is the key team's support.
As a stopper, he's going to face the charges of a partner's offense.
There's a couple of thousands of people coming, no hell, talking about the Greek team of Hybs.
And he's partially aware of what he can wait for on Thursday night.
I know a lot about Fataie who played in Romanian Astre with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their tapes.
I know it's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparty, said Goian.
The next football club didn't mention it, and that's exactly the question if David Lafata, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparty.
Goian smiled, and with a easy look, he went to the Czech newspaper.
"Why are you asking me about this?"
He's been down for a while.
We saw some video, and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot of teams.
He's got a really good player.
Was It Designed?
It's okay, but I don't know anyone else except Fataie.
That partner of Goian knows very well.
"My experiences from larger clubs, it can be said that he's holding Asteraz's defense, is such a player's organizer," said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian's got the best years for himself, but he can enjoy a very interesting photobook.
In his time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, and both the Manchester branches of the United and City, moved from Steauy to the Italian Palermo, and played for Glass Rangers.
We're waiting for aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, playing European games regularly, spending on victory in the Czech league.
I like this game, but we play home, and we want to start a group with good results.
Like Sparta, we're gonna try to win, put Goian in.
I'm in a room with the Slovenian banker Thomas Košik, who is very happy with the Czechs.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to Czech, considering the entrance to the Prague bridge.
The new seat should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading shares of the company on the Warsaw bridge.
Our primary objective is to have the seat of a group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have recently taken in the project are extremely legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on society's actions, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In relation to the transfer of seats, the shareholders of the group consider the location of the shares on the Prague bridge."
As a result of the entry into the Burz of Price Papers Prague, the company concludes the prospectus of a securities which is submitted by the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of holding seats and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of an open transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
In the context of this operation, no action will be offered to the public or to the new investors.
"The appropriate offer of action to new investors would be made - so the company and its shareholders would decide - later, either on Thursday 4th 2015 or on 1st of April 2016," the company said.
The company has already indicated in the past that any offer of shares could be made from the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could be made from the stock offers at the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of the stock exchange.
Test of the objectives of the Czech television in information on the migration crisis.
A further small test of objectivity and exportability of the report of the main Czech media on the outbreak of the crisis.
This time sending the main news report from Czech TV.
How's it going?
When they're at the university of journalism to learn how the media can manipulate the reality, they can leave today the Czech TV of the Event.
The migrator crisis was estimated to have sent about 80% of the reporting.
Until the first minute ČT informed of the concerns at the Serbian-Madarian border and the attacks of migrants on the police called them euphemistic, patience came to them – they had been rocked and attacked by combatants), and now a more pro-Migrant propaganda - you can think of the names of individual reporters.
Critics of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticize misbehavior behaviour with migrants.
Syrian children in Czech school - history of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
It's not just a threat, it's a chance.
Traveling fugitives - ČT therefore uses the words of a fugitive or a fugitive and not a migrants.
It is particularly disturbing that ČT is used in illustrations only and only for small children and women.
At the same time, she pointed out that 80% of the migrants in Czech had been detained.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that has no periods of communist aggression.
I have to say I'm ashamed of my colleagues as a former journalist.
Ecology in practice.
When I was once able to stay on the board, I soon stopped being the only citizen.
I was moved by the fish in the backyard.
The domestic fish, the smile with the change of imperfect, i.e., the unproving of them from the nest to the breast and the young looks like a mature single, only small and progressively growing.
I was opposed, and I didn't cut them off.
First, manually and later also chemically.
Socialist drugs on their liquids provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it's been successful.
Later, I had a similar experience with Pharaoh.
Crabic with some juvenileist who brought the ants into the nest and then did not allow the king to produce a new generation.
But I rejected it.
As time went by, he also became the object of my admiration, and I became increasingly convinced that they have the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I've learned from my life the experience that keeping in the ecosystem doesn't lead to success and one can replace another.
The truth is, I wouldn't take it easy for the white man and the white man to get rid of their car by killing them.
In the new room, we agreed with the partner that if we don't have fish to swim for the church, we'll be able to eat the leaves of the skin, some of these invisible roses and something like that.
Their quiet existence in time ruined the palace.
He was a typical type of hunter who spent a long time sitting on a tree.
We had to live out of regular mice and cameras, which only increased our comfort.
Because he's been with us for a few years, we've found that he's mainly living with the fish and that he's obviously kept their numbers in a state of emergency.
With reliable regular contact, we found that it's the same thing when everything is done.
We have been witnesses of romantic agreements with a partner about a third less, as carefully as it turns out to be a haircut, so that he will not be collected before he reaches the decomposing shell.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't respond to our controls.
Under the western table where the graceful games were played, we later found the rest of the hound.
After a long week, he didn't even wake up.
When we thought it had already happened to us, we were surprised by the number of small dolls that grew in her neighborhood.
It's too late.
I mean, they've been tied up with my mom, I've got another one.
Even the same thing disappeared in a week.
If she went to someone else, or if she did, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the roof again.
True, something less, most likely the daughter of those West Bankers.
At some point from the roof, she carefully observed our behavior and the transfer under the back of the boat estimated our incompatibility as a friendship.
In some cases, the number of listed fish has decreased again and the herd has been able to look for regular activities to ensure food.
He hasn't changed our ecosystem all year long.
Our daughter grew to age when the use of the night was gone.
We have tolerated it to this day, but the eternal removal of its contents has already eaten us.
We've made her more and more vulnerable to the use of the West.
The daughter, however, found an explanation in what she saw very well when she was beaten.
Our words about seeing the doll, luck in the house, don't even count it.
I cried and I kissed my night off.
It wasn't the rest.
It was the moment when he had to report in the interest of the development team of the daughter.
It's been on me.
He was taken to the castle and shown across the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was laughing at him like a friend, but I felt as if I were a stranger for so long.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and start to multiply in the geometric line.
The world's wild, the week, the two, we've never seen anything out there.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if there's a wall there that's nothing to suggest that the middle of the West is not as familiar with their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and again they were wrong.
I had to think of another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I came to the point that their focus on hell had to be on the cause that if he didn't see it being buried somewhere else and that it was dangerous from anywhere else.
Or they may have had some telepathic connections with their predecessor and his rapid disappearance in them caused some alarming reaction.
You know, I don't do any illusions about their air.
They showed some light of goodness, but that they would react to holding hands or moving fast, it's not.
The daughter's going to the west on a regular basis.
I think she's forgotten about the night.
It's just going to be a little bit of a break again.
I'm already sending my invitation to the restaurant, and I hope they won't believe me after the execution.
Otherwise we should use the cycle B.
Nineteen of Albert Einstein's products, who loved the world.
The effects of the scientific genius of the past century will seem to be never going to fascinate mankind.
It proved to be so deep that the plant was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most famous scientists of all time.
To the public, he was particularly familiar with his special and general theory of relativity, which in turn best describes the universe in its giant dimensions.
Its explanation of the photoefact or the idea of quantification of the electromagnetic field is also not to be recalled.
There is no doubt that the personal description and structure of the knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so widespread that it is easier to get to know more.
It's not easy, though.
It wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't even find a brilliantly simple way of explaining: The hour close to your sweet looks like a minute; the minute in the hot bed seems to be an hour - and that's relative.
I've been able to select from his whole fleet of famous readers the tens that have just caught me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, they try not to do them.
Just two things are endless.
The universe and the human mind.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No amount of trials can ever prove that I was right.
But the only thing that can ever prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break the atom than to destroy the ancestors.
If the mess on the table is not a good idea, what does the empty table look like?
I don't know what it's going to be fighting in the third world war, but in the fourth it's gonna be rock and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but there is no way to get him up.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to handle the problem that would take my life, I would spend 40 minutes with his study, 15 minutes with his analysis and 5 minutes with his solution.
It's the hardest thing in the world to get tax from income.
At the end I can't give up Einstein's formula to define success: If we take A for success, we pay the example: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest, and Z is to keep the language for teeth.
New to modernism.
Hospitals in Zlinski expect changes of 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider that all four of these years are held in black numbers," hetman Stanislav Misák noted peacefully.
The overall profit of national equipment is now about 32 million kroner.
The share is mainly higher than the insurance benefits, which are equally recognised for the year.
And this fact shows that in recent years hospitals can finally allow more investment.
In Croatia, Sweden, the Uherish City and the Greens, this is due to buildings that will total about 1.5 billion crowns.
It's been a long time when we bought most of the equipment, it's over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, there's nothing to do with spy health, and it's caused the plans of the national hospital Lubomír Neces.
She's happy to change every hospital.
The nurses will come to the hospital next year.
At Vsatina, the suppliers of the new internal Pavilion are now choosing about 300 million kroner.
In Croatia, they have a planned launch of dialysis.
The Uhersk City wants to set up a new interior for 200 million to open the central Pavilion for the year.
And the green Bajó Hospital is waiting for a long-term construction of a new central entrance and interior, which will require three fourths of billion.
In all cases, it is fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors are an extremely important step," for example, told the head of the Hospital believe Prousková.
The 5-star building has to be a ready hole for two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
The changes that are clearly known to patients in particular affect all regions.
The new buildings also replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, they need only one toilet on the floor, the beds are unsatisfied, the windows are quiet and the doctors do not have the right conditions for work.
"For example, our internal system was established five years ago and now is at the edge of its life," said the director of the criminal hospital Pavel Calábek.
For a few years, therefore, it is rewarded by the seven-day modern building built with an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will have all acute divisions in one place, more in new areas.
The same model already has half of the Uher's Hall.
The central entrance is already in place, and it's within three years.
"We will pay the loan from credit and partly from own resources," explained Director Peter Sládek.
This hospital can only allow its own funding to be granted as a single country.
The profit is still the highest and has not been achieved even two years ago when the ill-fated spleen must have suffered almost two million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance, excellent performance, higher income and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdák, who has an old-age economy, said.
Improvements are also expected for patients in the chromeline hospital.
During ten to fifteen years he will be able to repair, repair, and rebuild up to half a billion crowns.
This year, it will be ready to repair the storage station, and then it will start to build a slide, where appropriate, a building for a new magnetic resonance.

Nobody explained to me how I should keep the acceptable shelters in the country if they don't want to live in Czech.
Minister within Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) has argued with his European colleagues that the other Czech States are pressing for a quota for the distribution of surpluses, but any debate is refused.
It is also true that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the assigned surpluses in Czech if they don't want to live with us at all.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position that you have come to meet with ministers within and outside the European Union?
We don't agree with the required quotas as a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like salts or mollusks.
These are the living habitats that have some visions, some direction, they have some magic.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we were able to keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were to redistribution.
We can't imagine that.
We didn't get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, then registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for Africa and other things, we have no problem.
We've been talking about it for years and we're saying this is a road.
But tell me the quotas are going to be all right?
We've settled forty-four thousand recently, and now it's a hundred twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how are we gonna keep those people on the ground?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
We don't want anyone around us. We just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, get asylum in us, but people from this migration wave, then from Syria and other countries, are extremely close to zero.
You've failed to tell us that the hostages don't really want us, but we've already committed ourselves to accepting 50 people.
Wouldn't it be possible to take them this way any more?
We committed ourselves to take 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, food protection, military operations.
And in the 1500s, it's about 1100 people we're going to deal with.
They'll come to our detachment device and we'll walk to it just like we've got.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe if we can keep people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, as appropriate in Hungary.
Because Europe is acting in such a way that if they have registrations, they can't be held.
This means they'll come to our territory with registration, and if there's an agreement that's not yet, it can happen that even the 1100s will not remain on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go back to Germany.
If we are able to maintain them during the asylum procedure, we will establish an asylum procedure with them.
If it is a citizen of Syria, Eritrea, nearly 98 per cent of European statistics will gain international protection.
Then they will receive evidence that will enable them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people are going to end again in the target countries.
Then there are four people who will move.
This is the second project that is currently going on, and we have only continued to debate with the churches about the possibility of helping them to get jobs, housing and so on.
But it's a long run.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss meeting with the ministers.
But it's not that the Czech Republic simply refuses quotas, but does it offer no solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly is this supposed to be a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany calls for all Syrian migrants to be able to do so, this report will be circulated in a series of hours throughout all the camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's another migration wave that leads to Germany because they just don't want us.
We think that the road is protected by external borders - just the migration waves to prepare, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
I mean, let them know they don't have a chance.
Just a year later, there were tens of thousands of Kosovos in Germany.
From the security of Kosovo, where we pay all the saturies of this state, including the police, the courts, the state representatives.
If we were able to divide them and not accept them or accept them only as needed by the economy, they would be reduced to 10% of what social systems are giving them today.
On the contrary, on the first day when Germany took control, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic was reduced.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
Where does it come from to speed up the border controls?
We were afraid of saving hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we control.
We still have a number of free places in stone detachment devices.
Of course, all the people we're holding will be back in Rakouska in seven days.
We're doing it by default.
They're the only ones who bring us these people, they're complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - it's a whole story.
So where's the point of the crime?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it should be a couple of days.
Two walls, three people a day two, three after each other are wasting our abilities so much that they have a crisis plan.
Then I agreed with Mr. Prime Minister to call the superior government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're several times in a phone call every day.
If this situation occurs, the government may sit down with de facto immediately and, by a single resolution, decide to strengthen the army police, let's give it to the customs administration, whatever the prison service.
The country option is an exceptional position that has now declared Hungary in some places?
I don't think that's how far it's going to go.
You will realize that our positions are different, we are national states within Europe, the Schengen border is only on the airport.
I don't know what should happen in order for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, is more likely to prove that Hungary is attempting to withdraw the migration route to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean the direct route to Rakouska.
The Czech Republic would be affected very carefully, almost at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debts for the last time.
He's trying to prevent the announcement of the incident.
Fotbal Slavia paid debts.
Their money was expected by the footballers.
Photovoltaic Slavia stood in the front of the court for the first time because of the insolvency order.
About three months later, the company's proposal for Online Services from the Pacific Samoa was proposed for 20 million kroner.
The legal representative of Slavie Zuzana Mládkova tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl during several hours that he had no intention of declaring an accident on Slavia.
And I need to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week with the new owner of Slavie became a major Chinese industry and investment group of CEFC and also a Czech billionaire Jiří Šimán.
Apparently from new owners to the club, they got money, and that's the last time.
This also proves that Slavie's statement before the final trial - the top club on Monday, just the day before the trial, has sent tens of millions of crowns.
"It was all between the 11th and the 15th," said the legal representative of Slavi Mládková.
Who paid Slavia?
Current and former players and business partners.
In particular, for example, the Slovenian representative Milan Ivanov or Czech deputy Mariu Lickov.
Slavia has also sacrificed agents' wages to Alexander Losenicke.
On Friday, the club also paid debt payments to the city part of Prague 10.
The parties to the insolvency dispute thus remain de facto only the searches that Slavie resolves.
Whether you're in the club or you're not in charge of any of these commitments, or they're being brought up by court disputes.
However, we are prepared to pay for the losses of these disputes.
"We have the means we need in the bank account, which we can put out of the account," the lawyer Młádková told the judge.
"All that has been paid is punished," declared Młádkova, adding that the unpaid debts are only unpaid or disbursed bonds.
Of course, it is also true that in the near future the court will not decide and the procedure will continue.
She gave Slavii three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the aforementioned debts.
Next comes the assessment of all the evidence.
The decisions can therefore be expected first in November.
The Court ordered a further hearing on the third day of November.
However, the decision won't even happen at this meeting, but it's written after him.

FastMig X is the most recent generation of inverting sources.
The combination of spicy technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into modular construction brings benefits and speedy return of investment in the same high-quality, productivity and compatibility.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final system is always configured according to customer requirements.
And it is any one, from the mixing of the construction steel after the mixing of the special sludges, as well as from the mixing of rough materials after the mixing of the heavy pellets, from the application in the sections to the sludges.
Unliquidated quantities of pollutant, simple setup and expansion of the pollutant source allow rapid response to changing requirements, leading to lowering of waste, the need to stop sources and to more productive distortions.
FastMig X allows distortions by spying processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and quality of distortion.
It ceases to waste time and does not come to the spread of material or repair errors.
It's guaranteed flexibility, it's less forgiveness, more distortions and higher profits.
It's an annual newspaper that had a prime minister in Nitre, where she also got gold medals.
We appreciate these poems very much because they confirm the product's exceptionality.
The world's former manufacturers can mix with similar systems, but thanks to the differences in software and the management of parameters, FastMig X belongs to the world's spy.
For the interested parties, there are certainly more pleasant and time-added periods that move around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts that are likely to expand beyond the fireplace.

Blanca was going to make it so she wouldn't go away.
But it's still about half a billion more, says a company expert who designed a tunnel.
The white man's gone a little safer, says the expert.
The tunnel complex Blanca was possible to establish that there were no two damages to the country in Prague Stromovce, said the manufacturer of the Satra company, which is the main designator of the tunnel, Alexander Butovic.
He said it in the middle of the evening at the newsman's tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive, according to him.
The driver will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went safely, but the costs grew exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce were the same for the entire period, although the country was only a few steps away from the place from where it started to operate a safer and more careful method.
"If this measure were used 500 metres ago, the tunnel would be half a billion-price," Butovic said.
The White Tunnel fell three times during the construction.
Twice, in 2008, the crater was established in Stromovce, and in 2010 the land was split into the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrosta Jírí Bélohlova, the tunnel is too expensive, said the week of Euro.
According to the original plan, the position was 17 billion kroner.
When we start to calculate DPH, which doubled during the construction period, you have a total of seven billion.
When it comes to technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valuation and similar positions, it is 29 billion, which is not from 37 again to so far, notes Bélohlov.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to get a new iPhone operating system with new Apple update
A new operating system may be required in the Settings when you click on the "Inverse" card and select "Software Update" (upgrading software).
When it is ready, your phone will offer you the opportunity to download and install it.
Some users have encountered a problem after installation, in particular with the error message "the upgrade of the software has crashed".
One of the solutions to this problem is to wait while you are interested in updating or trying via iTunes.
Your phone is running an up-to-date process.
And this includes the need to uninstall applications to release places - but this will not be necessary because Apple has reduced the update and has also simplified the process through the use of a special tool that users proposed to remove and reinstall after updating.
Make sure your phone is busy before you start updating.
If battery status is low, Apple does not allow upgrades to be down, as interrupting the process could cause the update to fail.
Other reports: the release of iOS 9 has not been suspended, despite the maintenance of Watchos; the iOS 9: review triggering the updating of the new version of the operating system; iOS9: how to prepare for the release of the new operating system for iPhone
Make sure that you have passed our list of things to do before updates that try to prevent or protect them. iOS 9 will present new functions, including smarter personal assistants and a large range of creative functions for iPad, as well as a lot of payments to speed up and repair the operating system.
FedExu cuts mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported adverse results for the last quarter and a large reduction in the forecast of the zero profit due to low demand after cost adjustment and higher costs for the subsidised dividends.
The company also indicated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers through the holidays.
In this late year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holidays.
The company's shares amounted to about 2.5 per cent in pre-marketing 45 minutes before the mid-opening.
The FedEx company states that it expects the difference between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next flower, which means a decrease of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
The analysts expected $10.84, according to a factset study conducted by the company.
The reduced view is due despite an increase in the rate rates of 4.9 per cent, as shown in January 4, and higher charges for underground transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company pointed out that it is still expected to increase profits over the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The president of the presidency and the director-general of Fred Smith said that the company "prevented a firm's performance despite the low expectations of the economy, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The plans for renting were announced on the day following the fact that the airlines indicated that they had more than 90 000 to 95 000 employees, which is probably the same as last year.
In the fourth year ending in August 31, FedEx received $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The share profit amounted to $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for the share, which was predicted by 12 analyses by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets grew by 5 percent, at $12.3 billion.
Six analysts of the Zacks company asked for $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been undermining priority international shipping in recent years, which has led to the arrival of its Express units.
But a boom in online shopping has sent the results of the earthly unit FedEx.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 per cent, but the profit of the industry was essentially the same because of higher prices for the larger packages and their own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher basic rates, while profit decreased in the cost trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-sale trade about an hour before the opening of the FedEx company, the share of FedEx was charged at $3.85, or by 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They ended yesterday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the 11th June record.
At its most expected meeting for the entire year, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week in 27 steps of a long Honduran mahogany table and will decide if it is time to increase the key rate after almost ten years.
On the one end of the Ordinance of the Central Bank, the double seating room will be located in the mouth of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have to give economic interests to the people above all others.
The Central Bank has a double struggle with Congress: maximising American employment and maintaining higher prices stable.
But since the Great Reception, the representatives of the Federation have recognized that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be notified on Thursday whether the American economy is prepared to be released when leaving the unprecedented incentive in the form of almost zero short-term rates in place since the end of 2008.
Although most data show a solid growth of the economy, recent turbulence on world financial markets could already be alarmed by the fact that it increases its reference rate of federal funds - and nothing more than just a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economy of the milk company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that they were just looking for a clue to an increase in demand, an increase in uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient reason to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed will do, which is the cause of nervousness in financial markets.
About half of the economies recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect Fed to maintain its position, with key indicators only around 30% of the chance to increase.
This would indicate a decline in the share market in the case that Fed increases rates, only if policy is changing, I agree that further increases are not seen.
In the industrial average, Dow Jones jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The assembly was disappointed by the expectation that Fed's policies will maintain rates of rest this week, says John Lonski, the major economy in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if Fed now raised taxes," he says.
If the Fed politicians did that, "they would have to go to the country in their programme announcements and hold hands on the financial markets so as not to ruin the country."
Other experts said that increasing the rate would calm the financial market, as it would remove the uncertainty about how Fed would proceed.
Only a month ago, it seemed that Fed was on a good way to raise the rate of 0.25 percent this month, the first small step in the slowdown of changing conditions that would confirm the economic recovery force in the United States.
Yellen said that over the summer and early years, there is expected an increase in rates in the year, and over the difficulties of liberals, that more economic progress is needed.
Although the creation of jobs in August declined, the labour market this year marked solid growth.
The unemployment rate is 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full employment.
The fingerprints showed the lift marks.
And although inflation continues to run under 2% of the annual target of the central bank, Fed's policies say that for the main reason, it has been a temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the complexity of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to decline by the end of the last month after China destroyed its currency.
The industrial average of the Down Jones company was 16% below its record value in May, when investors feared that the decline in the Chinese economy would result in global growth.
The market has sometimes risen in this month, and the Dow now loses only about 10% of the farm's maximum.
The political factors of Feda’s unhappy market situation provide a complex calculation when increasing interest rates begin.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would have come to this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, leading researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now they're supposed to wait at least a month to get better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about how it will affect the US economy, and there's almost no data on what could happen with regard to the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Federation, so it should not be technically included in their decisions.
But in fact, Fed has become the world's changer.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
In 2013, Bena S. Bernanke's ex-President said that Fed could "use" their monetary expansion on the market, put down the rounds around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still more favourable, it can be expected that the representatives of the Federation will also follow the development of others, but they also deal with other central bankers and experts so that they can read the position of the global economy better.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management company Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, V., pointed out this month that "Fed has history of movements in financial markets that appear to be incompatible with economic foundations."
Lacker, who voted in favour of the creation of the Federal Committee on Open Market Policy, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led Fed to a reduction in its reference rate of 0.75 per cent during the three meetings "I over limited identification effects on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed's representatives turned down these drawings.
Fed should be aware of the financial stability concerns only during the major crisis, such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Bank of England's Bank of England Committee.
The latest calls are not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets are breaking up," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the International Economy .
The Federal Reserve System Act has two other mandates and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should have access to spy.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese quarter.
Yes, the Chinese quarter
The store was opened in 1997 and is owned by the LAX-C Inc.
Often marked as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a large commercial Thai market that also sells for the public.
Yeah, it's a Chinese quarter, not a Thai quarter.
The market/sclad is the only contact point that offers a range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian districts, and kitchen furnishings, furniture, religious and sacred decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need some engine oil.
The deal is massive and will last for an hour before you pass all the streets.
If you have any food from all this shopping, go to the LAX-C BBQ Express food.
The internal commercial station (good, left) is close to registers and is available in different places.
What's up: You need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Loans are affordable and a lot of items are sold in large quantities.
Among pure products are special Asian and regional Thai beauties, fruit and other.
The expansion of the mass is great, for example the fish - the workers will kiss you and eat you, even if you are tired of it, if you like it,
A good part of the trade is left to the massive freezing section where you will find frozen leaves, hot melons and gallantals, whole fish, fish, blood vessels and ice cream, weldings, ice creams, regional clasps, freely sold semitrailers and other.
Who buys here: Restaurants and chefs, as well as private families and individuals.
The broad streets go up against buying cars and high-speed vehicles.
Nález: Pure monthong durian near the station.
Where to find: Trade is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, covering the property of the Chinese quarter and centre - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which shares with other shops and restaurants.
While trade can be covered, parking is usually not a difficult finding.
The speed on the streets will stay with the old man.
The speed of 150 km/h Snow stopped.
At selected distances, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under the conditions.
On the other hand, Snömovna decided on Tuesday when she joined the changing proposal of Senat, which declined the increase in speed.
The new Land Communications Act will now be directed to the President.
President Miloš Zeman has already said in depth that the law would speed up the leg that allows it to be slowed down.
The Minister for Transport Dan Žook (for the UN) was against the increase, according to which the Czech remote network has not yet been established at such speed.
In the morning before the delegation, he supported the senate version of the law.
The approved new is now possible in accordance with the original government proposal for an increase of speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class trains, in particular four-years.
At first, this opportunity was extended to the distance to which it would be possible to travel at selected speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The messengers now joined his proposal.
The senators agreed with the Minister for Transport of New Zealand to also have the right of the transport police to have the last word in order to correct local communications concerning the elderly.
The senate version approved by the Snow is also calculated to allow channelling, water or cables of public lighting to be placed below the surface of the vehicle.
People would be saved so as to save land.
Citizens should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along the local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
Novela also helps to improve the protection of the road and facilitate the urbanization of vehicles which are not registered by the owners.
A new citizen could sell decomposed vehicles that do not register within six months of notification of their owners' response.
Citizens will have the opportunity to issue a transit cost transport across their territory by road to other third and third countries under the threat of prosecutions and for shipping companies.
It also takes the opportunity to introduce electronic remote markings instead of supplies of paper, which will also be used after 1 January of the following year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The fingerprint is in front of the court.
He's been threatened for 10 years for the victim's ex-wifery.
The event relates to a detailed project for inviting citizens.
The police wanted to silence Zuzan Kail (ČSSD) in this case, but the Polish film did not.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both are in danger of imprisonment for up to ten years.
The main line is already scheduled for two consecutive days.
According to the State representative Mandík and Macík, the damage has occurred at least one million kroner, resulting from regret.
The complaint is about a finding trial.
The former members of the city’s leadership, according to the applicant’s title, have not been able to obtain the property benefits of the company which was organised by the citizens.
According to the complaint, the chief of the Magistrate Committee of City Services, Schools and Culture has made it possible for him to speak in the electoral management of five companies.
When another company that offered the lowest price was notified to the competition, the company broke down.
At that time, the city had to trust the administrator and only Darothore was registered in the competition, which the council of the city had awarded the ban.
The city paid at least a million more.
Both charges are aimed at ensuring that Darothore has given public orders to organize actions to invite residents in the Port of Labe in the long term and, in coordination, at least in dispute with the demand for a proper economy procedure, writes the State representative.
At the same time, they have been aware that Darothore’s company subsequently calculates the Authority over Lab for the implementation of the action to attract citizens of the price, which will reduce the real value of the services actually provided in question.
In three years, the company, according to the project, has recorded more than five million crowns.
In the end, the city paid only one portion, a total of 1.7 million kroner, and then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was at least over a million kroner according to the expert survey.
The mind has already rejected any violation of the law.
I didn't sleep with any criminal action, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-in cause, the former prime minister said that the city, under his leadership, had only been involved in a similar project over the years.
In 2008-2010 the event was ensured by Agent Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminals initially wanted to accuse the Kailo delegation, who was also a member of the city council.
She's a little funny, but she didn't take it to touch her.
Therefore, in her case, the criminal was dismissed, but it is calculated that Cain’s guilt was after the end of his sending order.
Greetings were a social action that took place several times a year.
With her, the mother received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
The Hungarian police reportedly let the dog's back.
Then the reporters were able to delete the record.
The Hungarian police were on the border with Serbia's short-term cameraman of the AP agency and sent him to destroy the record on which the police dog had reportedly landed on the ground of the quake.
The Hungarian government, however, has failed this charge.
An incident took place on Saturday evening when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia via the corn field near the Hungarian city of Russia.
Anti-Smokers were chased by the police, and one of them allowed a certain Syrian to chase dogs with a knife on his chest.
The dog that called "Please, please, I'm a doll," said Musi.
The fact that the Museum is filming everything, he's seen one of the cops and he's not allowed to leave.
The journalist should never call his superiors or his colleagues again.
The police took the music to a dark place at the registration center for the hostages and asked him to show them what he had stored.
Then they ordered him to record it.
This was the result of the two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt dangerous because the dogs were close.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian Government of Zoltán Kovács.
The conduct of the police in it was unacceptable and indicated that journalists should be able to cover up the events without risking physical violence and not fear that the government would destroy legally acquired material.
Kovacs, calling for the police report of the Museum's incident, was missing.
He said the police only wanted the press to show them if they were on some arrests, which they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't use anything.
"The dogs can shoot - they're excited to be scared and a little scared, but they certainly didn't fight," Kovács says.
The invisible League of Masters.
Winning the City will catch us, believes Juventus
"It's a failure, I don't think we deserve to lose," struck Manuel Pellegrini, the housewife.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was the classic League of Masters.
Not one team has created a lot of opportunities, but the sword on the balls we had a long way to go.
"The cause of the injuries was not in the tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful balls," he estimated the shooting of Pellegrini, which the team recorded in a competition flight in 636 minutes.
This finalist of the past season Juventus was on it just before the interlocution - after the first three streets of Italy, he has a piece of the titler only point and the score 2:4 is up to 16 places of the table.
And that's why the interview at the Ethihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This game will help us psychologically," said coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three oppositions - Pirla, Téveze and Vidala.
In Manchester, they represented Pogba, Manjukic and Morata.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe we'll find it on the winning floor," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're dealing with the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we've been better, especially in the attack phase.
My player deserves this result.
"In front of our balance sheet, we could rather invest at 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us," praised Uncle Allegri, General Buffona.
"We've burned several good shots," hated Yayu Touré, founder of City.
We need to get out of the League of Experience Masters and next try to make a better outcome.
Good morning Angelo, old German II.
Before we go further on the question of immigrants, we should be aware that the whole media pollution around is controlled by professionals.
According to the need for the media and the sister.
And then let's stop for a second.
Today are news and media filled with children who are not on their parents' hands on empty exodus routes.
And this causes a person - and then in a European person - to feel guilt and conscience automatically.
Well, they don't come here just trusted children, but look at the crew members arriving on the Greek islands that the baby is not so much to see!
Well, and some of us have recently disappeared from the television of the ships measuring at Lampedus, who fled before the French border in Menton, where the beautiful landscapes are home to thousands of young men.
A large part of the young blacks.
And they also disappeared images from Callais, where these snows and black men are waiting for them to pass through the tunnel under La Manche.
He's probably not getting it anymore.
Even those images of the primitive Christian church of Eritrejc have never made a special impression on the people of Europe.
You're running out of this run of lies.
So when it comes to the quota for refugees, it's something that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria, but also about raised - for older people: fashionable - young man.
Their muscles look like they're just getting out of some fan.
That's just one personal experience.
This summer in Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus we were on a private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, she came to the beach at once with a big group of cars.
But there's no kisses.
And there came out of them young men of their own.
About thirty men and five women.
The age between 15 and 30 years.
Go to the beach, all the clothes in signs and shoes. In hand, like otherwise, smartphones.
It's about a private beach, it's not interesting, and the employees - Turks, Muslims - are obviously afraid of them.
They've built all the sheets.
Whoever wasn't on it and was right in the sea, he had a shame.
They were dressed like the American rapper movie.
On the head of the hat, the white and the colored adhesion on the feet.
Then they put on the local beach bar and started walking.
They set up the chairs around them, gathered around the seats of the evenings and the whites of the bars, and read to the Muslims and the Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children walked from the food terrace somewhere to rest.
The next blacksmiths drank beer equal to the third of them - like in the US series?! - on the beach they washed empty air around them.
There's still a voice on each other.
It wasn't English at all.
Then they gave themselves to drink wine, as well as the equivalent of oil.
They raced to the hotel pool - in sign language, especially the young ladies - in the water they ate and slept, the mothers and children fled in fear, and for half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the swimming pool or no one else.
They've all been wrong.
No matter whether anyone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The priest said to me last night, "Did you see the gold that they had on themselves?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it at work," said the reader.
I said, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a circle of about 20 inches thick and a massy cross of gold.
And the women were like gold.
"Are these drug dealers?" I asked.
"You've seen how they cry," said the reader.
The drugs don't work, they don't even use it.
They're completely different.
So I've already got a clear picture of what they've been feeding.
It wasn't that important to me yet in June 2105.
I didn't know what to follow.
But the secret services and top politics should know first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were born in Europe at the time.
And they go, they go, they go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union is that total-political and corrective policies, such as intellectuals and related lobbying and economic groups, have the greatest influence in Europe.
Germany and its policies - today the most widely recognized major forces in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only are they, also EU spies and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the winner in Germany are at the level of pictures of Moscow TV from August 1968.
Of course, there were a couple of sunbirds on the beach, but mainly - the elderly - the Muslims have saved their own.
For weeks, they have been bluffing in reports on Czech television, such as just one of the Germans, according to some research, almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
Anyone who was just a few days in Germany knows it's a lie like a serpent.
That confirms other information.
For example, a famous study of the public opinion organised by the ARD - Czech Association of public television companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to take more than a week ago.
It also announced our TV.
The second day was closed in Germany: the polling poll showed that 94.5 per cent of German immigrants no longer wanted - the polls participated 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly announced in November 2010, and five years ago, "Our efforts on multi-cultural society have been completely successful."
Then she said, "Germany is fighting a multicultural society."
"All the forces of such a relationship have totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it does not suggest that a strategy that allows people from different cultural backgrounds to live with themselves without integration. Today they live with us, and we have been claiming that they will not one day disappear again.
But that's not true.
A multicultural approach, when we say that we're just happy with ourselves, this approach has gone down.
It's just a dream.
But even Merkel's probably won't have the power to go against the strong Germany and Europe, especially against political justice.
It shows the scale of the event.
The conflict is moving fast.
Euronemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, a SPD Ambassador, the only one who is obviously not even a parent in the European Parliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play at the centre for a minute - as he has predicted several times.
It seems, in particular under the impression of the latest results of German policies, that Germany exceeded Rubikon.
Of course, until some European policies do not support these products, the citizens of countries that have been victims of Nazism are terrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and strong Germans?
Those who have been trying to, at least for a while, take advantage of their horrible past of aggression and murder millions?
Do they have the truth of what they say that in Germany, there are seven demons of aggression, oppression, and violence?
Did the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck have the truth when he stopped all his forces from trying the Great Britains to control the whole of Europe?
When did he say the Great German idea will be destroyed by Germany?
He probably did.
When they left her, she started preparing for World War I.
The thought of Velkoniemek, who led Germany and Europe into two wars that continued millions of lives, probably returned in another way.
After the Marxists tried to rule the state, for example with the Rote Army Group, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, on the basis of ecology, which was one of the main ideal sciences of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunglasses.
Germany's elites have long defended the cause of German nationalism, and thus left all those combatants in the room, too proud to seek peace for all, who have supported the old imperial and Nazi word Our forest must live.
In order to calm down the unhappy young people who want to do something different and better everywhere in the world, they were fully devoted to the fighters against the warming of the planet, stopped nuclear power, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called propelletian - and an anti-Sloven tradition that regarded all of the Slovenians as difficult verbs - since the time of Karl Marxe, who, after his parents ’ death, was mainly German nationalist.
And also as shown by the last results of Schulze and the German ministers openly threatening disobedient eastern states, the idea of the German leadership.
Who needs to listen without a word.
Otherwise, you're hungry!
And if we agree that immigrants are a very influential group of volunteers, we have what we have.
And this is always the capital, especially Germany, which is responsible for the fact that Germany, in particular through the banks and the Union, controls most of the European States.
The Sunshine Pseudovir first introduced Germany into the pool of ecologicalism and multilateralism, and today it has brought them home and may still bring millions of Muslims.
Those who, with the sweet voice of the siren, find fast on the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and start fighting.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbours with force, but again can part of its citizens - but as it seems, still less part - is ideologically confused, but eventually it is reality as always realized.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim residence is getting worse.
What will the German government do when public protests against the Germans come to power?
They will come to help Muslims who have been living in Germany for a long time, but are they definitely never assimilation so as to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalization of Muslims, Islamists and Germans are left behind, following the fear of Islamizing their country?
What will he do with Germany, and even with Germany, when people who will vote and publicly protest against the new Euro-Human Muslims?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has led to the support of solar ideology in Europe, hence the elite and, in principle, the totality of its non-existent banks, is growing.
And because of the undeterred movement against the disobedient democratic Germans and all obedient and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot happen well.
It's the end of the morning.
The best way to get rid of concerned sellers: to scare them to death.
It's enough to lock up, and the robot's falling down on you in a way that's not going to get any worse.
Renew your head with a nice set and filled and dry, except for (or more affected) by the non-sustainable seller and the refreshing juice on the way.
Maybe it's a shame that the speaker can't really figure out what he's talking about.
And we'd have a lot of fun and jokes.
Strawberry rose (Oxalis corniculata).
A terrible flood that tolerates dry environments.
And that's how it's between the outer walls near my apartment.
On 16 September 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that belongs to the expansive islands, but it looks like it creates a beautiful home for the flowering.
It's between the outer fences.
She's unquestionable. She's in our garden.
He likes the dry environment, it's easy to adapt, humble and harmless.
The network is creating letters with chaotic composition, but that's why it's worth watching and photographing.
From a small perspective, there is the beauty of the detail - green flowers and green leaves also with a velvet taste.
Brazilian Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet when riding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come in a shocking way to try to get women to know the meaning of good care in cooking images of children from the breast of an unhealthful diet.
Human mother milk consists of various proteins, tissues, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide horses with all the animals they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and newborn mothers are recommended to increase daily calorie intake of 500 calories a day.
However, new studies indicate that increased calorie intake is not the only diet action that mothers should take.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that the healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic structure of their children and protected them from developing breast cancers.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthful diets had a negative effect on the child immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rules, even though Nina's tries to take control of Today Show
The support of Karla Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry for covering costs due to the result of the only result of the liberal leadership failed to create a sufficient increase in the assessment for Today.
Early show Nine from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbulla Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with host David Koche and Samantha Armyatage, moved to London as part of a long series of international television broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not appear that the distance from the Aussie TV was so concerned, since it recorded 397 000 dives in five main cities compared to 330,000 broadcast dives today.
Today it recorded a smaller increase in its assessment compared to the sub-division (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was to last Thursday (343,000).
Today, in the last few months, it's filling the line on Sunrise.
In August, Today was averaged 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the tides moved between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 girls and today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added to TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A great report for Seven was a playful debut 800 words with the former star Packed to the Raffers Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a newly married father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has a very large average of 1,219 million widows.
Critics wondered if Thomson would be able to catch a TV hit without the stars Raffers Rebeccy Gibney.
The result of yesterday's evening is clear "an".
The X Factor of Seven left a strong 1,136 million wildlings, with a smooth appearance of The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed follow-up on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new television series (from 17:00 to 17:30), introduced by Andrew O'Keefe's, had an average of 446 000 fans.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 dragons — which resulted in a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 diamonds and a second half of the unbelievable 720,000.
Hot Seat was about 620,000.
Thanks to the decline in The Chase Australia assessment from the second night, Nina will be convinced that Hot Seat at 17:30 will finally win.
The Chase Australia is restored by a million dollar minute order that failed to defeat McGuiiro show.
Originally published as Sunrise dominates, while Today remains local
Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect guy - but who will choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski may not have found out who wins Bachelor.
A woman who comes to Bachelor with Sam Wood is deceived by an inexhaustible secret.
And the three remaining girls are definitely not aware who's the right that's finally getting roses.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezanay Markosski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they left just two, thank you for telling us who's winning.
Sam Wood keeps the tooth language in the fourth term.
All three lyric women explained why Wood was a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as reason why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, what will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as an observer about who gets Bachelor's heart.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, Markos quickly named Mackay as here, which would be the best way to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared a certain day's ease of reference.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of the Sary and Sam, I felt that they were pretty compatible and I still think that during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really a country woman, she's a lot fun with her," Markovski added.
I saw them together and there's this right chemistry between them.
They're good together and nice.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could make a couple.
She herself claims that during his last visit home, she realized that Wood could be "just."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game anymore - I opened my heart to him now," he adds.
I asked who would choose Wood if she didn't.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love both girls the same way - it's between Snezen and Lana.
Bachalor leaves in the middle of 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States, and a lot of teams were asked after his great start of training at the end of the last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and seems to be a reasonable decision.
Some of the coaches left Hayne sitting after the rest of the season because he made a mistake, making a conversion of Australia's ruby leagues at the first climb from the top at the level of the 20th in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to get back and put him into the game after Reggie Bushe was hurt.
Tomsula was also still honest in the tent after the game.
Instead of bringing them together before the rest of the team, he was able to wake them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne's press conference after the funeral.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne also received excitement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and just think about another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
Surely it was not a start where Hayne and his massive Australian fan club trusted his NFL debut.
Hayne was arrested when he left the field after his mistake and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy at 2DayFM 104.1 worse start of the career in NFL.
"It's happening, just focus on another game and that's all," said Hayne
Hayne compared the traps to his original debut in 2007, when the record in its own branch area led to three Queensland.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo of the fans on which she holds an Australian train on her own Instagram game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin meet in discussions on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by armed men at the Siberian border.
After the openly questioned by President Vladimir Putina, Khodorkovsky was dismissed, his theft company was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. has become immigrants who have settled in their own home.
Two emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
Since 1989 it was no longer possible for the owner to return, so the two of them turned to the state for compensation under the law on extradite rehabilitation.
The Court first granted them the required amount, then over 2.8 million kroner, the appeal court, but their application changed so that only a few 90,000 kroner could be accepted, with the claim that the amount of the compensation is determined under the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants were brought before the Supreme Court and arrested the original complaint.
The Ministry of Finance, which was to pay the money, turned to the U.S.
In the meantime, social and economic changes have resulted in such changes that the reward granted under the then applicable legal provisions - that it would then represent an adequate compensation in relation to outstanding property - today only partially higher property value.
"This cannot go to the number of subsequent participants who are entitled to the refund of entitled persons who have come to their homes since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to pay their wages in advance," the judge told Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the U.S. has taken his stand on the side of immigrants.
"The Commission has repeatedly expressed its intention that the general courts should act in the restoration matters so as not to have any consequences in the interests of the entitled persons and always to achieve the purpose of the restoration of the law, thus opening the property infringements caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the music studio DVA is now a creative Council of Fisher.
On the other hand, the Council of Fisher became the world’s youngest Evita, when in 1998 the role of the wife of Argentina’s dictator Ev Perón was confirmed by the first Czech introduction of this famous music by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Spirà’s church.
To return to the same role, she says, "Today, Evity's commitment is very uneven."
Avoiding it is not only a wonderful role, it is also responsibility.
As the first lady in Argentina, she recommended Monika Absolon.
I saw Monc three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I've seen a whole new idea right here.
I'm a gift of more modern reforms, but that's just what this is all about.
"Rejie Ondreje Sokolo is original, relaxed and contemporary," Fishar observes.
To think of the presentation of the musical ring between the two singers, it will come to the Narozenen concert of Monika Abson on 27 September from 19 hours in the studio DVA.
Tonight, they're doing great with Evita's music.
You will certainly belong to the common Duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Do your crying, Argentina!).
In the limited amount of presentation, Ondréj Sokol will also withdraw from the government bottle when he takes the role of President Carl Rodena after the film is played by the President of Peru.
For the sake of public interest, further terms were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of world music Evita introduces the studio DVA in collaboration with The Real Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
In the state of Ondreje Sokola, the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolon.
On her side, Karel Roden's cup is presented as president of Peru and as Che Peter Strenačik's role.
The legendary song from the parts of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts Michaela Prostéjövsky sings to the living orchestra under the direction of Krystofa Mark, who has already participated in the first entry in the Spiral Festival.
4 people killed after the police shot rubber projects on demonstration in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber projects against the proposal of a new state constitution, placed in the center of the official.
The violence came on Tuesday evening in the fourth day of Rupandeh, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a leading officer, says more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station, and some were shooting stones and burning bombs.
Mr Dhakal points out that the police used the heavy gas and then fired into the air before they got caught up in rubber projects.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projects known for their ability to kill, but were traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused by a high death rate.
This strike was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern region of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi said they set up a new province under the proposed new constitution, and their political influence was reduced.
Further demonstrations in Western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which calls for the rise of its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police, were killed during violent attacks on 10 August.
when four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the province — a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which was centrally addressed throughout the year.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but the lawmakers have accelerated the process after a zero earthquake that killed thousands of people in the depth.
The lawmakers in Kathmandu voted this week on the proposal for a constitution and the officials state that the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We can't panic right now.
After the fall on the back of the mysterious Lithuania, you did not control any domestic duel with the hockey Sparty (3:5).
Don't you have any concern about the likes of a disaster entry into extraglidance like this year?
I hope there's nothing like it.
Congratulations, Folk.
NHC predicts 60 per cent probability of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The wide lowland system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the most beautiful Cape Verde Islands is likely to have 60 per cent in the wake of the tropical cycle in the next 48 hours, leading to the inland U.S. National Hurican Centre.
Another well-defined low-cost system between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilamis also has 60 percent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added the weather forecast with a stay in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign aimed at choosing 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has indicated that the campaign, whose aim is to select 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have fled the European states in the run of war from the defeated and poor countries.
Google announced this on his blog a very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by the employees of Googlu Rita Masoudov on the basis of personal experience as she spent seven years with her family from Kabul.
"We met in many dark streets and buses and lived hungry, cold, winter and fear," said Masoudov.
I was lucky.
But the growing migration crisis in Europe is still a family of people like this, who are willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Borderless Doctors, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google indicated that all contributions made through the google.com/refugeerlief page up to $5.5 million doubled.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees from the Second World War, most of which come from Syria with four-year-old war, which has only escaped to 4 million people this year.
Many people are also fleeing the war of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For peaceful obese diabetes, it could be useful surgery for loss.
The results of the loss of surgery for mild obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mild-absorbed people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery than those with non-surgery treatment.
"The data on mortality last a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the surgery, who wrote an introduction to the new study of JAMA surgery.
Beverage surgery is used to reduce anxiety by different methods.
Reduce hunger and restrict the human body to absorb food.
Over the course of the years, baratric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with a morbidity with an index of body weight (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMI, which measures the weighted weight ratio of the height, is considered to be normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the prevalence of persons and persons with a value above 30 are considered to be obese.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Tchaj-wana used the data collected from the 2007 study, which consists of two types of baratric surgery - breast-feeding bypass and gashrektomy - in the treatment procedures of type 3 diabetes in people who were mildly obsessive.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery was 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to study.
In the meantime, BMI remained among those who had not been given surgery treatment for diabetes, the sum was equal to 29.
In patients with surgery, diabetes was fully resolved in 36 percent and in 28 cases.
In the treated group, only 1 per cent of diabetes was completely resolved and approximately 2 per cent of patients were treated.
The control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was also shown "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers have also monitored patients at the level of haemoglobin A1c in blood that reflects the passing of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is the best to keep below 7% of the cold, according to researchers.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin value of A1c was approximately 9 per cent at 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at approximately 8 per cent in the group treated.
But this better "glycemic control" - which is reflected in better levels of A1c haemoglobin - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the group lost more weight compared to the group of gashrectomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), increased BMI decreases (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and the risk of diabetes reduction (46.9% versus 16.7%).
While a new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they have found that surgery leads to a prolongation of life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who have undergone baratric surgery had approximately 29 per cent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years compared with a group that has tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone said it was a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"Right here this work is critical because it indicates that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI," he says, without raising the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking care of really seriously after a reduction in BMI patients between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting for too long for people to notice the gravity of the situation," she says.
I think that once these genetic changes are collected, which strongly suggest their bodies with fat and sugar, the road back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to grasp all the obstacles, Dalai Lama introduced, adding that the real solution to the current emergency crisis lies in the near future.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in rural countries.
The Dalalalama addressed the question of the outbreak of the outbreak of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interest of the people should be kept before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also pointed out that the response of Western European countries, whether it was already surprising, was inadequate in the context of the crisis.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his own words.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Rakouska's efforts in resolving the crisis, he stressed that it was only temporary solution.
"Announcement of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In resolving the question of violence, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints against George Bush after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claims that "the violent reaction of the United States has created a network of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my sincere condolences in the letter of President Bush and advised him that the way in which to solve this problem was not a violent road.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," he said.
Four-year increase in the number of children living in the last 4 years
The toxicological average around the United States reported about 400-percent increase from 2010 in the number of children up to 12 years of age who had high alcoholic sanitation factors, according to the toxicological average in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylorda Lopeze, director of the toxicological environment of Georgia, the number of births in children up to 12 years of age who were reported to the food control centre increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children get more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who must be brought to the market," said Lopez CNN.
Some children take a sanitistic approach, while others want to make a home for their friends or as a challenge to social media.
The video on Youtube shows nactylates as they drink the sanitative medium because of the left-wing habit.
Nactyllic acids have been deliberately mixed with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Young children may be affected by attractive noise.
"Children don't think about hurting them," Lopez said.
A number of more attractive (scientific means) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary facilities with the smell of balls, grepus or measurements that are very nice for children.
The sanitary environment contains between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Especially in young children, several places can mean alcohol consumption.
"It's a high concentration of alcohol," said Fox 4 station in Kansas City Medical Director of the control toxicological environment at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You would also stop whiskeys just like that, but people leave these sanitizers out and when kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently appeared in school to four parts of a sanitistic phenomenon with a jaundice fever and was taken for medical treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the legal value considered to be an adult burial, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a qualified doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah made an inexhaustible statement and was not able to walk after what she had experienced at the ready.
Doctors monitored her through the night in a private childhood hospital because of any signs of brain trauma, because she fell into alcohol and fell into the head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for the child’s delivery of sanitation.
Despite alcohol consumption, some sanitary measures have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after a combination of the sanitary environment that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors thought that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, more than ethanol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth anniversary in northern New York planned to expel their "bad" teachers by placing antibacterial products in the room," according to the police report.
The teacher was very allergic to sanitation and banned their presence in the room.
The police condemned the measured plan as "unrequired pressure," and pointed to the discipline of the school quarter,
Fama: No disagreement in the Celtic team
Griffiths baately analyzes the differences in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he's going to turn it back again.
Hearts will fight SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that new forces from the ice break a team.
Dons raise their jump over the Celtics at 5 points
The penant of the first half of the administration of ADMA Rooney provided Aberdeen with a solid victory over Hamilton in Pittody, thanks to Dons's five-fold leap between himself and the Celtic.
Griffiths speaks of disagreement
This situation has created a pattern of disagreement in Celtic, which has been overcome by Griffiths, who insists that he and his colleagues do not work under any pressure from increased control in preparations for the association with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think it's gonna be fun.
The lack of Scottish title rival offers the Netherlands - de Boer
Former co-rapporteur Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claims that the Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because there is no rival for the title.
De Boer, who is currently an Ajaxu fan, says: "In the Netherlands they don't show it the best of Celtic games anymore, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers anymore.
Older people don't just talk about the return of Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
He's talking about the two teams together, and they're just interested in it.
The old company has a lot of excitement and not only people from Scotland follow these games.
I'll turn things back to good, Deila's busy.
ROONY Delia admitted that Celtic was a little confused, but the Norwegian chief insisted that things would turn back to good.
Malm's defeat and the subsequent fall from the League of Masters was quickly followed by a strike against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now pertains to the top of the five-player board.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already lived a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what's happening.
We're all the same, but we have to go on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support because it's a lot better to play with her.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's got an air force's age
Despite the comments made a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his winter goals, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of power and insists that he doesn't want to break a team with Ibrox.
Former chief Brentford states: "The summer pass window is very different from that of the year."
Players who arrive in summer have a whole pre-session period on the move, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's really good.
Sometimes it will lead to more damage by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
The transitional objective of Celtic Micho points out the departure to the debt
The opponent Swansea Micha, who was connected to Celtic in a moving window, indicated that he could go to bed after his contract with Swansea was signed.
A 20-year-old shooter's got a problem with an incinerator for two years and couldn't find a way out of Wales this year.
Hearts will fight with SFA for comments against Nelson
Hearts led 2-1, when Patterson was sent to the tent and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this screen was later deleted - one about the third red card issued by a decision-making Collum.
Nelson stands behind his claim and says, "I didn't doubt integrity, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynecastle
The hardheaded Hibbe was strongly offended after he admitted that he sang a song with the text intended for the former player Hearts Rudolfu Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn region in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh earthquake in Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was about dust and it was a terrible moment," the attacker pointed out and continues, "I can say I can't go back to Tennessee unless it's in the course of Celtic."
The Council in Tannadic believes in Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Council of Dundee Unit still believes in the situation in the current management of the team - but admits that the crash on the hill must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're preparing the boy for action again," says Donnelly.
McCinness likes to be a "extraordinary victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his Aberdeen's team had to hope to stand against Hamilton Aces so that they could win the seven league victory after themselves and the five-foot jump before the Celts on the top of the table thanks to the pen from the first half of Adam Rooney's.
McInnes suggests: "There is no one who has won anything, no more fires or leagues, without having to win this kind of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the total unemployment of the UK is rising
IN Scotland, there are no changes to the number 164,000 between the flower and the Swedish age, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose from 10 000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent above peace in the UK (5.5 per cent), as data from the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
During the period of employment in Scotland, the number of workers now stopped at 2,612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland was 74.0 per cent during the fourth year - which is a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary of Scotland, David Mundell, commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost the exact year in which Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months, we were witnesses for further improvement in the labour market and the cost of growth, while unemployment was increasing.
Why I Was a Witness to Reform in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal interventions, I'm going to follow the murder of a man.
If that happens, and I hope it won't happen, I'll sit in a visiting gallery in the chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be repaired by the death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would be witnesses to his death.
I received my first invitation in January with my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to fear it.
Then why do I do it?
I've accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to monitor the corrections in America and because it is often more demanding than free places, a Morbid lottery is being held that determines who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever will be chosen will follow the whole correction without delay.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to the closest friend of Richard Glossip and I've created a special habit for him through months of phone calls and one and a half hours of visits.
I like that guy.
We laugh often when we talk together.
The federal board says I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't have a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll have to remember all the details soon.
A newspaper from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the behaver as soon as he's agreed to, get access.
I ran into her.
She admitted that "it could be better," but she still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could ever remove me from the witness list.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help his actions against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, journalist from Huffington Post, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't be sure Richard Glossip's innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him a prisoner from the community in criminal proceedings.
But I believe there is a great possibility that he's innocent from murder.
I am convinced that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
According to my opinion, the correction is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm going to follow his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
To that end, you can turn to other journalists.
What you'll get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love to die of the rest of the world.
A man escaped from Canning River by a police officer
The Canning Vale guard stayed dry after he freed a man from Canning River.
The search for a man from Peter, who was running from the police, didn't go out after he got to the small pool of water just a few meters from the police who tried to force him to talk to him so he could go back to the shore.
The police from Canning Vale were summoned to the incident moving to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When he saw the suspect, he tried to get them out of the Canning River alone.
But he didn't get away with it.
"He was standing in the water and he kept saying, 'I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Schartal Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perahtec just didn't want to pay for the uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and that's a police operation."
"People sometimes try to do something fun," said Castledine.
The football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins landed on the ground to escape the bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Bena Coussian biotonic.
Peter Moody claims that the editors tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peter Moody accused the editor of Racing Victoria of trying to get him a spy and threatened that he would immediately end the race.
He focused on the organizers and the integrity department Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with the late Lady Tatai robbery on the day of the race, which was the last catch for him in the middle.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and appeared in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive side of the cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He went to the language about the Spanish charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like a "dangerous dry."
"I didn't want to say anything about that I've been sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel frustrated that it's all going out of you at once," said Moody.
He knows it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm gonna sleep well.
I want to go up to the top and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If I start thinking again, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I should consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Earlier Moody released in his conversation for racing.com bomb that the integrity department tried to spy on him.
"Before the eighteenth month of Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him employment in my positions to find information about things that are happening in my circumstances," Moody said to Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a traitor.
If that's true, everyone should show up their information, because they're trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, co-chair of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, co-general director of RVL, was aware of it at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow up a couple of shoes and arrange for people to take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I wrong about this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and get me out of here, and I don't have any doubt that what I'm telling them is going to give them a mind.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really bothered me.
I'll press on them and I'll take care of them so they can make decisions.
I have my family's support, and I can leave.
The nurse's frustration of the coach increased with a long-term examination of the cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent deterioration in it caused the feeling that "he could have his license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of an unexploded Black Caviar champion, has marked the healing rule on the day of the race for "much" after the horse was applied to the legs by an iron frame or blue, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my team's fault brought on his leg a blond.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody conducted a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the cargo on the day of the race to which the editors had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram's driver who caught him was arrested.
The police arrested a man who hit the bike and took off the train for a weekend in Cobra.
Cyclist was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after the car was installed on the main Murray Valley train in Saturday morning.
The police indicated that the motorist left without stopping and helping the wounded driver.
In the afternoon, a 17-year-old man from Nathalia introduced himself to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected that it will be blamed for the absence of an accident, the lack of assistance and other transport barriers.
A 40-year-old man from Cobra remains in a stable hospital.
Trainer Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns the tail to the rivers because of the rising pressure
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the steps of his players as "setting a plan" by two NRL favorites of primersship.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the decision-makers allowed Storm to "wrestle" his player during the competitive victory of the Storm team at the end of Sydney's final qualification on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a quick note on Strom after his team won final qualifications over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening when he called the game "a look" on the corner of the league and according to him two from Queensland weren't "great" on the growling.
Bellamy defended the interests of his players and said they were focusing on "Contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has increased his consciousness because his team is criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean they're afraid of falling from the Storm team.
"It's still coming--I don't remember Trent Robinson would talk about the resurrection when we were hit by 24-2," said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and technology in the last year, we've only been looking forward to contact in the past few weeks, and this has meant work for us.
Trent's been here for three years and apparently training a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, which could be a little shock for him.
It's funny how things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy rejected Bennett's idea of a "surprising football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team, St. George-Illawarra Dragons, won in 2010 a premiership playing a "done" football.
Wayne's talking about the exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours. It was also exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized for being a nude team and Wayne said it was totally one of his own.
But now he's got a team that can play the style of games that belongs to him, especially his young crews with their speed.
You'd like to play such a football if you had this type of player available.
He said this opinion in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It stirs up more self-consciousness in me because they say such things because they have concerns about the threat of war against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got to big sports.
Bellamy also showed the fact that the Storm and Roosters were more vulnerable than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos team was probably good, I didn't see it, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two other attempts, but is it an exciting football?
Or are the obstacles and the lack of care is interesting?
I think it's agents.
If they're talking to us, it means we're meeting again at a certain stage.
The Storm has a stop this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronella Sharks in the preliminary weekend in AAMI Park. The lists will be on sale from the morning of the next afternoon.
The Serbian man received a fine of $200,000 for drug charges
The man who led a possible life of 40 kilograms of cocaine that was stolen from Queensland received a fine of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic (29 years old) was one of the five men who arrested the federal police last month for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and was detained in Coomer in August.
Maximovic was arrested during a meeting with a co-indicted party during the afternoon and later met with them at the Coomer Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he was referring to the potential decision to have a commercial quality cocaine, the lawyer Maximovice argued that there was no evidence that he would own the entire quantity and that he could be completely profitable and innocent in the coffee industry.
Judge of the highest court, Peter Flaangan, thought that Maximovic would be dead.
He's got a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
In the Korean case, the police lied about where he lived.
The mother and her own father Maximovice together offered 200 000 dollars for his release.
"After reading the statements made by the two persons, it is clear that the penalty imposed by USD 200 000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flangan.
Their efforts were apparently insufficient because the accused had not been brought before the court.
Maximovic was sentenced to imprisonment under the condition that he was released as an Australian, both Serbian and Serbian passport, will report to the police every day and will be sentenced to 18 hours until 6 in the morning.
Stefan Hogg used the girl's phone to find pedophiles to send pictures
Pedofil used the phone for a single girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Stefan Hogg took a girl's phone when she was asleep, then logged in on her online chat, where he had a lot of disobedient pictures of kids sent to him by another user.
The girl read and found out she missed her phone and then found it in the hands of the Hogga sleeper.
She passed him, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police entered and saw five photographs, followed by the analytical calculators found an address, and found a "dangerous" search on the web using expressions to look for children's inappropriate images.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was "to bring pedophiles" on the Internet before he would "pretend that he was a police officer and scared him."
Fiscal representative Eidh Robertson pointed out for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's dependence - it's dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that he was looking for a computer, but he claims he just wanted to pretend he was a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent pictures to him and why he wanted to send more.
According to him, he did it to find her.
He claims he went through the funeral and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found a message on her phone, she called her mother, screamed and cried.
She saw the wrong picture on her phone and was disappointed after the confrontation.
The girl was listening and talking about how the suspect used her computer and Playstation to be able to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Hog, 23, living in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted the guilt for making a complaint concerning the adoption or supply of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of the prison on 25 January and failed to be heard in court on 24 March of this year.
Lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the list of sexual delinquents, because he could argue that there was no "no basic sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael filed a ruling on the award of a social worker report.
In this case, Hogg was convicted, but he was held in custody before hearing of other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his trial.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe presented a wrong statement in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, had fallen on the stairs leading to the floor earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but his bad video became official in social media.
Parliament's opening was also prompted by opposition legislators' claims that they had received anonymity of killings which were warned against Mr. Mugabe's arrest during his trial.
The last month, they published it and called on it during his announcement on the status of the people in Parliament - that is the word he packed in the afternoon.
The president of the Hungarian Group for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition policies had adopted text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to prevent Mr. Mugabe's appearance.
"The story comes from numbers that don't appear, but it's called 'death'," he told the journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and, as soon as it passes out of Parliament, their immunity does not work.
The president pointed out that the party led by Morgan Tsvangari has "bows" on behalf of the Members.
Hewlett-Packard is trying to reduce the number of jobs up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard has reduced 25 000 to 30,000 jobs within its efforts to restructure and support the costs of business services.
The HP company will be divided into two companies charged on the bridge later this year and will divide the trade with computers and printers from its faster growing operations of the company hardware and services.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the amount of approximately $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, states the report of the company HP.
"This restructuring activity will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP and President of the Presidency, who will be in charge of the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more sophisticated than today's HP and will have a wide and wide range of trade portfolios that will help businesses switch to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the needs of our customers worldwide.
The Hewlett Parkard Enterprise company will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be aimed at providing non-competitive integrated technological solutions" to the company.
This comes to the distribution of companies that were founded in 1930 by the students of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, which manufactures electrical equipment and their garage in Palo Alto was transformed by "the family of Silicon Valley."
The HP company has undergone massive reorganisation to manage the transfer from traditional personal computers to the mobile device.
This HP company, the second largest PC producer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the conviction that the profits of the specialised company have better results.
Captain Arsenálu Mikel Arteta says the players have to get injured by Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also pointed out for Wilshere that it is still only a shadow and, if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there is no reason for him to play again about the prizes.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four other English games and, in the eyes of history, his involvement in another European summer mystery is obviously uncertain.
The big damage to this newest problem is that Wilshere ended the last strong season after he was hit by a cat and then got back into the previous form during the pre-selection.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It didn't happen to his cousins or the injuries he had suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view of the truth, because Wenger acknowledged that there is a relatively dangerous risk of further injuries, whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern here.
A study carried out by Primer Injuries Ltd. mentions 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his irony debate six years ago.
During the last five years, he has only played in 65 leagues of Arsenal from the total number 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, it means that in six to eight sessions from 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs who lost most of the days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the preserved circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the area of recorded injuries will continue during the last season.
"When you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he'll have a career that he deserves.
Arsenal begins the campaign in Lize champions on the middle of the night against Dinamo Zagreb with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to destroy his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey had to travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to occur.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal Theo Walcotta.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it out," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favour to the F process, Maximir in Zagreb has a history of the most threatening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not broken up in 41 steps after having held the campaign of "unresponsible" last season.
In the middle of the night, the stadium broke down with 3.2 degrees Richter.
This year was set up in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champagne when he capitalized against Monaco and remains a distant hope that he will lead the club to the first victory in Europe.
"This finding is huge," Wenger says.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not shots.
FriendsFest: a comedian show that gives us valuable lessons about male friendship
Absence of similar views in various shows is in the eye, especially given the need for men to open themselves more confidently than when it comes to suicide among young men up to 15 years of age.
In 2013, one of the biggest causes of men's death in 20-45 years was in Britain and it remains three times more in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campagn Against Living Miserably (CALM) noted 2015 as the Year of Males, whose goal is to disrupt the culture that prevents men from looking for help if needed.
In the heart of this struggle there is friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 middle school students showing signs of depression found that in the event that the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "health management", their chances of survival doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the bread of mentally healthy friends offers a half chance of coping with mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, it must, of course, be first available.
In this communication via social media based on style and not on the content of communication, the immediate response is often prior to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we doubled our need to look stronger, more loving and successful fun, even though we are actually more isolated.
This surface success is governed by what psychologists call external values; money, images, social status, all for the sake of our real values - our personal touch after growth and friendship - which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and her face recently explained, money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
None of the compositions were defined, but their personalities, which were created through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, while watching the football on comfortable crosswalks, Ross's breath after Rachel, all memories of knowing that yes, men can also complain about it, even though most of them leave their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, "my role as a listening person who feels depressed or self-restraint has really confirmed to me that even the least friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with their friends.
The old saying "depending on it" is strong in the sense that it will be considered weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the series that will remind me of when I try to offer a longer-term balance mechanism.
It highlights a little bit of a man's friendship.
As for my task, the position of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of confidence, but long-term support must come from a closer relationship, from a friend and family network.
If you arrive this weekend at the Comedy Central station, why not take your friends to Central Park, where the interior will be fully reprocessed for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and greet him.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
A series of friends will be sent to Comedy Central station from beginning to end - total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria took care of and helped PSG more Malmo stranger
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidim and Edinson Cavanim after the explosion of the branch against Malma.
Angel Di Maria took care of his debut at the Lize Misters and helped PSG win the Swedish team Malmo in the afternoon.
Here's a report on the back and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both took care of their journey to Paris Saint-Germany with the final comfort victory 2-0 against Malmo at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the branch less than four minutes after his debut in the Lize Mistró, and this PSG player sent French champions for victory, but then several shots arrived, until they finally won their jump when Cavani shot the branch head in 61 minutes.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donnetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against Swedish champions, because they are not only focusing on qualifications for racing cars, but on improving their roads to the fourth finals that were recorded in each of the previous three years.
But even though they received three points, it was not a classic performance for Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic before the bank, and later he was challenged against his domestic team and club, in which he started his prestigious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win out or home in the Migratory League, so the 2-0 victory makes our opponents problems and seemingly a good start in the army, even though there are things that we will need to improve through the season," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and win, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two branches anymore.
Ibrahimovic returned after being wounded as one of the three changes to the PSG team, which held home this weekend limit of 2-2 with Bordeaux in Lize 1, but was suspended in the fourth minute by Di Mario.
The Argentinian wing was marked as a man who took the PSG in Europe at a new level after the transition from Manchester United last month and showed why when he went to the Marcho Verratti's passport for Malma's defense and the beautiful end of the sword behind Johann Wiland to the distant corner of the branch.
However, if someone expected it to start with a great PSG victory, he had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off and got into this phase, was with 9 internationals in the basic system and five rounds, and two undercover depositors were difficult to resist.
But in addition to the shooting of Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed the distant branch of Kevin Trapp in 34 minutes, they didn't offer this much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself took advantage of the attack by bad threats and malicious closures which were neither good nor good for Ibrahimovice, which could not be fired nor five times in the first half, and was subsequently broken because his shot came to the network shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more appropriate when he came to prepare a chance for his fellow player, and that was right from his play when Di Maria sent a real shot that ended in the Wilderman branch in 52 minutes.
The second head finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavanum, this Uruguayic headman had already sent the six head of this season after what Ibrahimovic had played after the player from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility of getting something out of the trap, and only the decisive break by Willanda from the great proximity measured the hope of David Luise and the score remained unchanged and at the moment when the head of Ezequiel Lavezzi's shooting was not destroyed at the end of the strike.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team admitted that PSG was at the top of his team, Nor said, "Our last game in the Lize Mister took place in December last year."
Since then, we've only played Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Down for Paris.
For them, it was a catchy trap.
Glencore's company made $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
The current Glencore giant, who was established in Switzerland at the price of the commodit, made $2.5 billion for the sale of shares under its extensive debt reduction plan.
The company Glencore notes in its statement that she sold a new stock at about £1.6 billion in order to pay off debt.
This company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is affected by the decline in the price of the cod, as the Chinese slowdown reduces demand and distorts certain market conditions.
The legal problem raised the average price of Glencore's share on the London stock market in the early morning trades.
The shares increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pounds on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore's company dropped last week that the sale of shares at $2.5 billion is part of a wider plan to reduce their debt of $30 billion, which was collected about a third
The company sold a new stock at the price of 123 shares, meaning a 2,4% discount on the final price in the afternoon.
So 1.3 billion shares were saved at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
As regards the extension of Chinese growth, the price of iron and steel rails decreased by almost half and by 20 to 40 per cent.
White House confirmed Washington visiting Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his field report.
The first visit of President Xi to Washington on September 25, in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president welcomed the November meeting, brought a message.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obama are calling President Xi and his uncle Peng Liyuan for a state dinner that will be concluded after the closing of the talks.
"The Xi President's visit provides an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the United States and China and provides cooperation in solving problems in the fields of international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the shortcomings of both states," the report reports.
Xi, whose first visit was announced on the island, should visit Seattle, where he is on his way to Washington, with several technical guides from the United States, and will then proceed to New York to attend the UN summit.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will solve the problem of conflict, including the concern of Washington from a certain Chinese cyberpioney and its growing aggression in the waters of the South Pacific Sea.
As a sudden crisis, the Schengen area was cleared up.
The nuance light from Germany did not push the European crew away, but the ship is already moving to change the course, wrote the French poet Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of asylum seekers: it will be more systematic to classify migrants and asylum seekers as it moves on the old continent, especially in Greece, than it would have been to deal with the future distribution of refugees by quota on the basis of the number that is still increasing.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker requested 25 of the 28 EU countries to divide the 160 thousand refugees, the ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before considering the final destination of runners, first of all, it is necessary to filter those who are already arriving and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the external borders of the EU is necessary for the management of migration," stressed in the text of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Brussels.
After the crisis, the EU finds that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its resolve and increases pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Rakousk, but without blocking the impact of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power makes it clear that without it there is no free movement in Europe.
As evidence, Rakousko and Slovakia have already joined in this action on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also take this into account, even though they have different intensity.
Hungary's been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are eligible according to the Schengen rules.
It's about the dominant effect, but it's also dark.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone into the interior.
French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière were actively discussing it with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary during their private conversation.
It's not a new idea, but it's a matter of fact.
According to informal statistics, two thirds of the incoming runners were already registered and identified at the press conference.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory, because they are more afraid that there will be no camps in which refugees will be gathered on its account.
The actual black hole remains in Greece.
On its islands near the Turkish border, more than 200 thousand people were added in the year, twice as many as reached Italy in recent years.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came from Syria right after the last camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge iron door.
Athenians who are still in financial turmoil and who are waiting for a new government have put their hands in their mouths.
This is the outstanding point for the Balkan road and the source of today's joint elders for the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission has agreed that the control points will come first, but it has not indicated any number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece relate to Europe as a whole," said the EU ministers in the afternoon on mobility at this stage.
It is therefore appropriate to allow the European Border Control Agency Frontex team to operate in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen the surveillance of the island.
"It will need adequate financial resources," he warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the consequences of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is closer to that.
The new situation of the eight-year period has thus raised the second question of binding quotas and 160 thousand overcrowds, which had been brought up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and which had been strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their integrity.
The number, but never the duty, was held on Monday in the text approved by the majority of the eight-year-olds.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
One firm promise includes the dispersion of 40 thousand refugees in the next two years, with agreements already reached in June during the EU's hetic summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under a whale in Alpach, of which allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists who killed the whales in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nation is also a woman who has survived as one of the eight-year-olds.
Previously on the media, we said it was about Poland.
About 30-year-old women were hospitalised in the city of Briancon with serious foot injury.
The dead were made by the AFP, too, too, four-year-olds.
"The rescue action ended, and the victim's body was also transferred to Briancon," said the Prefect of the Hautes-Alpes Department Pierre Besnard.
The accident took place around Sunday in the mountainous area of Pelvoux under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Eclins, 4015 metres.
"The tallest valley was 250 metres wide and about a foot high," noted the chief of rescuers Nicolas Colombobani.
In an eight - foot - high eight - foot - high [9,900 m] group, a huge amount of snow fell.
Meteorological service today did not threaten the area prior to the emergency.
In front of Brago's record, the Trapišovska is finally right for Europe.
Coach Jindrich Trpišovský, in his fire-dominated prime minister, has been able to pass through the European League to the basic group and is now happy that he and his team are enjoying the right to Europe.
Sloven at the beginning of the main competition phase welcomes the 2011 Bragu finalist and according to the look, he wants to introduce his style of dress.
After all the nerves in the dynamism, when every head and every situation could sort you out on your way to the right group, we're there now and we're going to play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every stolen branch, we can play our tactics, and we're not bound by a double.
"It's a pleasure and it's a real Europe, before it was only a qualification," said Trpišovski at the press conference.
Bragg's considering the top team.
It will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at games.
The opponent may be even harder than not having such a name, but there is a player in his frame who gave Manchester a three-hole shower.
"It's an excellent goal at the top level of the teams," Trpišovski said.
He doesn't consider Bragu to be a clear favorite.
I'm taking it so we play home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we're also at home and in front of the show show that we're strong at our stadium, and that's what we want to confirm," he pointed out, which team lost from the eleven long hours of this season only the original Superpohare in Plzni.
He believes that Liberec can also take his style into account.
He's waiting for us, the team that's going to be strong at the game, but he's not disciplined for them.
They're playing 4-4-2 with a quick transition to the attack phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, the weak we've already discovered, but the most important thing will be how our players are doing on the hill," said Trpišovski.
In the past, we have learned a lot of contrasts that have helped us a lot, and this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to trainers.
"And we definitely want, even though it's very convenient to play according to our nots," the guard added.
Student films will be held by the Pisek, starting the international festival.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries reported their work on the 15th anniversary of the International Film Festival in Pisa.
Four tenths of them, which were commissioned by the Commission from students and pedagogians to final, will be sold from 15 to 18 October in Portic.
The best of them to choose an international jury, said the speaker of the Jakub Charvat Festival.
Every year he has his special theme that departs from the festival bells.
This year is a detective.
The director of the annual festivals, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to connect the first television, film and theatre.
"And of course we must also solve the crime that has been saved in our annual report," said Charvat.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
It will be appreciated by the International Report, which will include, for example, the winner of the last anniversary, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
The organizers of the festival each year prepare an appropriate programme.
Coming to Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singing Ondréj Ruml, professional player on Didgerido Ondréj Smeekal, turbosanson group in Poland?, plays the hat of Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapkova with a recital of Life on the bar.
The festival will host two photos.
The first introduction of the graduate of the song film school and the holder of prestigious evaluations, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ashenbrenner.
The second exhibition is near the atmosphere that ran into Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
At the address of the visitors, the cameraman and documentaryist Martin Čech, whose film The Cameraman delivers his song by Gerhard Gruber and song by his parents Brukner, Novotny and Hlach at the Jan Novotné's workshop, will cover his new book with 3 friends from the city of P.
We also remember this year at Miroslav Ondříčka, the master of FAMO in Píska, who recently left us.
Our school and festivals are his legacy, which will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop social ties and filmmaking," said the speaker.
It will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, complete a number of working competitions together and get such jobs.
The festival is connected to the Soukrome summit of the higher professional school of film in Fisku.
Her co-founders, Vladana's husband and Milan's wife, organized the first anniversary in 1997.
By the sixth year, he ran once in two years.
In the case of CK, they shall ensure that customer orders are fully maintained.
Insurance should build customer orders when the travel office is in full.
She decided to do so in the middle of the summer when she adopted an amended new law on conditions of business in the road.
Traveling authorities will be able, according to the proposals to be considered by the Senate, to replace insurance against the accident of a bank guarantee.
The security obligation to build client orders and the seating limit does not agree.
The Ministry for Local Development continues to argue about consumer protection.
The insurance has already threatened to end the insurance of travel offices against the shortness of payment.
But the proposal is also critical of travel officials.
Without assurance, they'll have to either end or go to the country.
The Ministry of Local Development of Karl Šlechtová (UNO) indicated that cases where insurance did not pay full compensation are not euroform.
She noted the annual decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client has a claim for full return of money without regard to the limit of insurance.
The insurance will provide sufficient information on the management of travel offices and will be able to determine the correct limit, Šlechtová highlighted.
"We appreciate the power to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit in order to be realistic," said the president of TOP 09 Miroslav Godosek.
The bank guarantee will not work according to it, because no one will give it any limit.
"Cost offices will have to end their activities or move to a foreign country," the Lord warned.
Member of the Association of Czech travel offices and agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) with divine concerns on the basis of a study between the members of the CK.
"Stop prescribing us lobbying insurance," he said.
The statement of assurance does not give Okamura any relevant, no official written statement in this sense does not exist.
But they'll find out at first whether the travel office is going to be involved, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Before the establishment, she also warned Jana Fischer (ODS) that she referred to the position of the Association of Travel Officers of the ČR and her associate, Petr Bendl, who spoke about the removal of stocks by the Czech travel office.
Traveling offices according to the Fishery will not be able to sit.
"The consumer protection works," the justice of Fischer.
Her proposal to release the opposing gang had not been adopted in a song.
He did not come to the House of Vojtéch Filip (KSCHM) with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee because of a particular dispute with the citizen.
Filip warned on travel agencies that, according to him, consumers could threaten.
In view of the value of the Constitutional Court’s proposal, the rapporteur, Martina Berdych (ANO), would have limited liability in cases where they were unable to know that certain compliance does not cover the whole risk.
Newly, there will be no originally proposed minimum four-mile limit of insurance for travel agencies offering flights to air transport, and a million-limit for the office selling buses, for example.
The threshold will remain at 30 per cent of the planned markets for the sale of passengers.
However, it will have to be such that, in the event of an accident, the travel office will cover all customer orders.
The standard even after adjustments provides that travel agencies will have to re-enter the services sold by the travel agency.
Travelling authorities will have to provide insurance before the conclusion of the contract, except for other information on savings and the number of contracts.
The approved amendments to the Committee's proposal for public administration shall also be made available with further regular information.
Travel officials will have to provide them with information on the number of passengers and the sales of passengers, the total price of the services sold and the amount of stocks and markets for the journeys and for instructions on them each month.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel officer has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations in respect of insurance, it shall, on the proposal, be able to prohibit it from concluding a new contract if the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
Novela also has to re-adjust the funding of mountain services.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service to be granted on the basis of its request, which will always be given at the end of the year in depth for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan for expenditure and a view for the next two years.
According to the association, the promoter of the law, but did not think about the situation that would happen if the insurance contract was concluded by CK.
It will not be allowed to rent and customers who bought the ticket before the insurance declaration, so they will come to it by reason of the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may also deteriorate, even though it was in good condition.
One of the options for dealing with such a situation will be the state of the return.
Another option will be to leave abroad and use a lot of soft conditions abroad, and then we will only act as agencies, said the president of Jan Papež Association.
The proposal for a new network also includes a bank guarantee institution, but it is not so far imagined that it cannot be implemented in practice, as bank guarantee cannot become an unlimited amount.
Furthermore, according to the association, the change in the availability of de facto practice is substantial.
In the two-year horizon, it will be necessary to recast the whole law in view of the new EU directive.
In the Czech market, he now operates around 942 active travel agencies.
In the year, only three CKs completed their activities.
Turkish travel agencies sell annual tickets at the cost of twenty billion Kč.
Markelov: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must be based on improving humanitarian conditions in overcrowded camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to mobilize refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after meeting with the German prime minister.
She also applied again for the distribution of surpluses that have already reached the EU between the Member States of the eight-year period.
We need to help the country where the refugees leave, where they will remain after their release.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will be able to establish adequate conditions in overcrowded camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to which such a signal could be higher financial aid or greater EU cooperation with international humanitarian organizations.
"The collective countries also support the German government in order to ensure fair distribution of the burden of the emergency crisis on the European country," Merkel added.
Land Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woodke, in this connection with the press conference, said he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The long-term distribution of refugees in the EU is rejected by other Czechs.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke to speed up the asylum process in Germany.
People need to know first if they have the chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to be able to start with the integration of foreigners as soon as possible, says the Broniber Prime Minister.
According to him, it is also necessary that the majority of the money that Germany spends in the care of the race is used for the integration of those who have the chance of getting asylum.
There will be a need for more teachers to control Germany.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if it is possible to integrate, they can become useful to us, he said.
Matt Damon backgammon
Matt Damon confronted African filmmaker Effie Brown during the discussion on diversity with the claim that it was not necessary for scenes.
During the weekly HBO episode of the Greenlight project, he interrupted herec contained in Brown's series, highlighting the need for alternative views regarding the Black protagonists in the scenario.
"When we talk about the variety, you'll do it by filming and not by filming," Damon says.
She was shocked, she responded to the offending Brown with disbelief and woke up "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about Martín were sent.
Damon and Brown joined the famous producer Ben Affleck and Brother Farrelly to discuss final shows.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think of being a director of anyone else, how they're going to behave to the character of Harmony," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character that's a stick that hits a white dog.
The producer of the Drazy White Peoples was celebrating the finalists of Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to film; Damon said that their regimes "would eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion, the social media exploded in accordance with Damon's comment.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his attention to the writing of the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the word of the only blackness in the room, so he can explain to her that the variety is TAK BILL that when it hurts."
Tweet got more than 5,000 tweets and 4,000 characters from the moment he was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when exact racial representation in the media is in front of a social debate.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Live Matter gang took national influence and pressure on the form of laws and authorities to maintain discriminatory practices against color people.
In the opening song, Prince made comments on the occasion, while he introduced what was named in the album category of the year during the presentation of the Grammy price.
"Or they're still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, they're still important.
The latest leader Black Lives Matter presented a statement in response to the issue of Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," declared the leaders.
Damon was recently reported on the list of grandmothers, producers and media of the Moguls who were invited to the pope's visit to discuss the appearance of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or he's already met with the pope, it's not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has first victory"
The professional champion and pickle Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and brought home a million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors were able to overcome all obstacles on the road.
During the final season of the year, two men fought in the last car, Caldiero and the cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was 30 square inches of over 220 meters long.
The Britten completed the shell as the first and in the limited limit and became such a first competitor that in the American Ninja Warrior has overcome a 4-fold rise, although Caldiero has overcome it for three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave a speech for the newsE! News immediately after his hard-pressed victory and it was known that he was still in shock from the prize prize at $1 million.
"It's a wonderful feeling, I've never done more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his victory.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it will be like now."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided a discussion in The Hollywood Reporter on the course of the finals and on why Britten won't get any reward and despite the fact that he became the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules of the money, it's up to who's gonna end up as fast as he can.
"If more competitors are involved, the prize will get the best time," Weed said.
Even though the success of the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his success.
"I don't think he'd be acting like a bitch.
He's glad he's been able to get what he's got.
He's got a hot reception from the fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
It's a garden for her children and her wife."
Geoff said to me, "If there should be someone who could beat me, I'd like it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eight season, which will begin to take place in January 2016.
The tigers from Detroit just passed through Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the tigers from Detroit, the second half of the season was the exact passing of the rose garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is right now in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
Only the tigers took away their fortune when in the outer layer, Minessot lost a quiet score of 5-4 on the Target Field stadium.
The two lost the chance to approach the Houston Astros team and catch a second wild map in the American League.
Even though only one night, for Detroit it was a return of words to Z, which was so uncomfortable for them during the second half of the season.
"Playing them is always fun and does not depend on how," said Tygro's manager Brad Ausmus.
The founder of Tygrós, Alfredo Simon, maintained his offensive attitude and healed Detroit three times in the first two changes and then took another in the sixth and ninth changes.
Simon (13-9) allowed a counter 6 1/3 and 3 trains.
It was his first third game of the last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with convincing results," said Simon.
"It's hard to get into the game when you're often sitting on the street and that's why I want to get to the game properly."
The tiger's pilot Victor Martinez has tripled and made 2 trips and his first score from half of August.
For Martinese, it was the first race game from the last red game to which the game went four times against Seattle Mariners.
"He's got a good deal of it," said Ausmus.
"He looked good at the trainer, threw a lot better and managed to move it to the back."
Thanks to three cycles at the end of the seven shifts, the Two got the greatest chance of returning to the game.
The middle polar bear Byron Buxton received a change thanks to two points on the left side of the garden.
Right Colonel Aaron Hicks got a point thanks to the set panel and Simon shot Brian Dozier before he switched Blaine Hardy's left.
Hardy ordered his only rival Mauer and had a rival Miguel Sana who fired the sword and took two years and left Drew VerHagen's rights behind him.
With two players on targets and a chance on the limit in the second change, VerHagen was able to send a third meter over two years.
Plouffe has already received 27 times over two years in this season and is king of the league table.
Detroit supported the ninth shift, Mauer got two points down and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for Tygry.
However, this right has been handed down by San on three occasions.
Detroit used the benefits and got points at Phil Hughes's game.
The tigers received three courses in the first two changes against the applicable law, which took place in the game after more than a month's break due to the interest of the required masses.
"I certainly didn't present myself with such a start," said Hughes, "but during the third change, I've already felt that I can make myself feel better."
After he gave up his first shift, Hughes left one point to Jan Kinsler's second meter.
Two exits for real polar J.D. Martinese brought Victor Martinese, who was the first one to run all the medals.
Victor Martinez broke his series 0-21.
Third metre Nick Castellanos followed him on the right side of the hill and took care of another course, but Victor Martinez was moved when he tried to reach the third stage.
The tigers added to the second change when the explorer James McCannn and Polish Anthony Gose got two and then one point and on the resulting table light score 3-0.
"It brought us to the knees," said manager Twočat Paul Molitor.
"The sword didn't work very well, but it got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won a number of awards, ended up in the third round without points and won A.J. Atter's rights.
Hughes escaped three years, got six shots and four shots.
WARNING: Anibal Sanchez, a real tiger hunter, ended the game with a disease in the right frame.
Dr. James Andrews, who fought Sanchez's arm in 2007.
The Sanchez, which is on the list of the injured by the sledges in half of August, should be placed in the middle of the trap.
Sancheze is replacing Daniel Norris' left, who will return after his injury and rise against the Two.
From June 30th, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left winner, he has a score of 1-1 per 4.
However, since August 20th, he has not yet played because of the violence.
The tigers and the Two play the third intertwined game on the Target Field stadium in the middle.
In contrast to Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) the Minnesotsk left nadazator Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.33 ERA).
Xi calls for opening the economy to a wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world for growth strengthening, President Xi Jinping said to the group whose task is for internal reform.
"The China should engage in facilitating foreign investment and professional knowledge and improving open policies," said about the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the deepening of overall reforms.
The promotion of openness in parental reforms adds a new impulse and vitality, which also provides a new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, the release of border controls policies, the support of state enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganise the registration system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment thresholds.
This system will be tested and improved through experimental programmes.
This step is important because the market will play a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring the legal environment and making the market more open, the declaration will be made.
The government will also be able to control the power of the firm and ensure that the companies themselves will decide how to manage their businesses.
The declaration also states that China will be able to publish new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth support.
In an effort to open up the controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to ask for permission to live forever or for a "green card", thanks to optimization of the requirements and simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop a professional judge and state officials was also scheduled for a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and chairpersons Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In Karlovar's country, they may create a new bedbreaking department.
According to the town of Hajtman of the Karlovar region of Jaku Pánika (ČSSD), the current capacity of the two national hospitals and two private hospitals in the country is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of the agreement between individual hospitals.
But there are also opportunities to expand care.
For example, in the division of surgical departments, a single surgery centre could be set up, where the proposed concept would be performed by surgical teams that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
In which specific hospitals the workplace should be focused on a single surgery, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of Karlov Vary, the laser centre could also be set up with the possibility of using laser techniques to treat skin disease.
The concept has also recommended the presence of apallic centre, which would care for patients with brain failure who are in the vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resultative division.
It is also possible to focus such equipment on an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Other bed capacity, which is considered inadequate in the Karlovar region, are the next bed of care and in particular the long-term bed of patients (LDN) whose capacity in the Nejdku is insufficient and should in particular be called acute.
Part of this device should function as a rehab and part as a classic LDN layer, recommends the concept.
As he warns, the next care beds are missing mainly in Karlov Vary's hospital.
There they would be allowed to use abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the last row in the Karlovar region, socially the health bed is absorbed by the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
This bed is not enough throughout the Republic, so it could also serve other countries as the so-called Alzheimer's.
Patients should also be prepared for the introduction of so-called binding beds, which will allow financial resources for European applications, as recommended.
"It's about a bed that will be called on the arms of the suspended care and will create a space for the translation of patients after a step, such as cardio-surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other step," describes the national concept of bed care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
