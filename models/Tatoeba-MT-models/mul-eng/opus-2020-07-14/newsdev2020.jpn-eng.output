Croatia's nuclear management project, Bosniak's protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the cities of northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, protesting Croatia's plan to excavate some of the only nuclear power stations in the region that are near the beautiful river near the border with Bosnia.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Democrats gathered at Novi Grads swore to Croatia that it would fight against the plan in order to destroy the territory of the soldiers of Toulgofska Gora.
This facility will be used to extinguish wastes from the solar power plant of Clusco.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," "We need to stop Uunna (the river)," said that the nuclear waste treatment facilities should not threaten the lives of some 250,000 people living around the island.
We have to resist.
Novi Glad's boss, Miroslav Drake, said this to the crowd.
We must fight for the protection of our homes and our rivers.
"Crusco atomic power plant, which began driving in the 980s, is located in Slovenia and is owned along with Croatia.
Government participants in the two countries are planning to open a future agreement and talk about the increase in waste management facilities.
The delegation of Croatia reported that on Friday, Croatia should build its own waste facility and that Slovenia should not yet decide to pay for the waste parts of Croatia that have been processed in the newly constructed facility.
Mr. Tomslav Scholitch, Minister for Environmental Protection of Croatia, said to Anaunser that Croatia is also in trouble with the treatment of public wastes from prisons, schools, hospitals, and services.
In Bosnia, workers and workers from all nations in the country have claimed that Croatia is looking for another site near its nuclear power station.
"Why, throughout Croatia, will the Poket of Bosnia, namely, the Tulgofska, become the most suitable place for Gora?"

"Before the children entered school, the parents signed a contract.
They're here every day for their children, and they know what kind of environment they're in.
I was surprised that the police had taken the children away from us, and that they had all the food that their parents had brought.
It is unfair to say that there are parents who can prove that the police have placed their children in a terrible environment. "
He added that the former Minister of Police, Abdularman, visited the children to see what kind of environment they were in, but he didn't say anything about it.
And the kids were just learning the Koran, they're just saying it.
However, the police station director Jacob Sabo says that children will be reunited with their parents when they are transferred to the state government.
"In the name of what they said about the Koran, they were placed in an inhuman environment.
There were signs of injuries in the back of many children.
So we're looking for schools to find out about the owner of the facility."

A girl's rapist at Central Cost's "Special Infamous" dress, ordering the victim and the victim in court.
In May 2017, a man who wore a colorful glycsette of his tongue brought a 12-year-old girl back to school in central Costa, the state.
Then the man added the girl to the tree with sexual violence.
After the arrest, a search warrant was issued and the police arrested most of the items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man admitted that he was guilty of seven suspects, including three suspects of sexual abuse, of this violence and other 11-year-old girls.
When 12-year-old victims were walking along the streets, they found that a man armed with large trees and snow was coming out of a hurry.
When the girl said, "Stop, stop, stop."
The man said to the girl, "Come on, don't make a loud noise.
When I hear a loud voice, I don't have to be in pain."
The man took his right hand and cut the girl's two legs in a cup of tea and abused me for about an hour.
He cried like a girl was crazy when he went to school.
The men had multiple e-mails and phone calls from their colleagues, but they didn't respond. They came to work at 9:00 a.m.
The man stood out in his clothes like wheat, wood, and wood, where he suffered from violence on the road and was chasing the driver to the ground.
A man's trial will continue on the day of the fire.
Pope Rome, AI development is based on public interest and warns IT business representatives.
In the absence of a reasonable assessment of public interest, the Roman Catholic Pope Francisco warned that the fear of social injustice would increase in the careers and other digital developments, such as IT business representatives, diplomats and investors, would increase social injustice.
The priest said that the government diplomatics, representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and linguists, met together at the Batchcan Conference.
At this meeting, the public interest in the digital era was also attended by a number of students and Catholics.
This three-day meeting was the latest evidence of the desire to participate in the debate on the future and dangerous development of human science.
There was a debate on the future of the development of war-time technology and the future of increased machine operations, while there was evidence of the terrorist attacks in New Zealand Cristrich and the reaction of the social media companies to the violence.
In his own speech at the meeting, the Queen announced the development of technical progress in the development of industrial revolutions, stating that the machinery had released workers from danger and simple labor.
But if you rely on robotics for your benefit, you'll be afraid that you'll get the dignity of your work from people.
"Technical progress is not the right move if it is the cause of the growing inequality."
If the so-called technological progress of human beings is against public interests and the enemy, it will turn into a state of disillusionment based on the theory of power.
According to the President of the Conference, I would like to use the expertise of the participants in this meeting to see what the Catholic Church will be looking for in future.
I'll show you at the G's show!

I'll buy you some comfort in the accident and in Lisbon.
A traffic accident caused by a traffic accident.
Otherwise, there's an increase in the number of accidents caused by the high driver's block and axel.
And when we're getting too fast, it's becoming panicous, and it's going to be a little bit of an axel that's going to break down.
A new vehicle equipped with security support features such as to cover this transport mix is present, but there are also possible rear-view devices that are not fitted with a vehicle.
That's an off-pearch marker that's developing and selling the emergency prevention system.
I'd like to show you how each of them has their characteristics.

When the program stopped or was slowed down, it was a "warming" sound that was more than necessary to break the brakes and pull the triggers.

Because of the lack of access to access, the engine changes will be clear and effective for the high-level drivers who listen to it.

The World Wardowing started its launch in mid-September, but the Axel Brooke's misprotective device is a very protective device.
It's not going to work. It's going back to time.
When an axelpedal is rushed to the front and back of the vehicle (and 10Km/h) and it detects the speed and brake signals on both sides of the vehicle, it controls the start of the axel electrically and inhibits the movement.
When an axelpedal is wrong, don't signal an axel, and you'll be able to control the rapid progress when you're in the mode of acceleral.
In the back, you can check the speeds of more than 5 km/h and load them with the ability to switch the vehicles into the crash state.
So we can do this by using a simple combination.

The judgment is scheduled to be delivered on 12 November.
Birds, high-risk racing techniques, three times the size of Nepal's agricultural ministers.
[Minister of Dawa Farms (right) of Nepal, who monitors the risk facilities at the risk park of birds]
Ten of the ministers of the Dawa Dorche Rama Farms of Nepal visited three-thirds of the city and the Riycl Park of the city, in the east of the city, on 26 days.
In the same country, they managed to cover most of the waste of their lives, but by leaving the students behind, the author of the Japanese School for Agriculture and Agriculture (67) in the city of Ziz, who was interviewed, introduced the technique of mass farming, and started to take the city of Catmans State Timmy to the town of Modul and to take the risk of taking them into the city.
In the cave, the technology is being used in the cosy facilities of a 19-year-old bird town, which is now being inspected by 30 February and is now being visited three times.
Prime Minister Dava, who was first involved in the survey, spoke to a local mayor in the city, who said, "The technology of Japan is coming in all over the world, not just Timmy, but the country," and asked for the exchange that had taken place in the city.
The mayor of the city said, "I'm surprised that I'm not going to go to all the birds' villages yet, and I want to continue to talk about my heart."
"The rain of rain, the rain, the rain, what was... the mother's experience in her childhood, and the preparation she made for her family."
"The White City Children are growing up and supporting the Sacracle" (the expert representative in the field) opened a meeting on 27 days in the city-based city-based city hall that shared the experiences and lessons of the Flood.
Some 20 mothers and mothers in their childhood thought about the kind of prevention they had in every family, and realized what they wanted to do with their own bodies.
In the north of the city of Huang Saukari (32) the three-year-olds who liked the farm did not go to the farm immediately after the flood, and did not go to it at night.
And he said, "Because the adults are busy with their homework, and they don't have enough time to go home," and he went back and said, "The adults don't want to cry, and they want to get ready to say "all right."
The capital of the White City was named after Haniri (36) who spent one night in the city's shelter in four families with three-year-olds.
"If there's a child who can't keep up, we'll take care of it around."
From 4 years to 2 years of age, women (45) from the city center where five children were born fell into water around the house.
"You can't run with five people," he says, and he's got food and light toilets in his house to spend as much as he can in times of disaster.
"It doesn't make sense, and the necessary equipment will change in family structure and living conditions."
A six- and eight-year-old student in White City (40) suggested, "The primary school had an e-mail in the past day, but there's no connection to the network and mail system.
I also wanted to build a system that could be shared with me in the airtime.
"Before the sky was changed, Mr. River said, "I didn't know that it was all right before, but I wanted to make a big deal with a little worker and a lot of people and prepare for disaster."
The country's representative said, "I think I'm going to talk to the administration as a group."
Boris Johnson's relationship with women's business manager, Jennifer Akurey, who took note of the police officers.
The IOPC will examine whether it should be examined by President Johnson because the crime in the city of London is a violation of criminal law.
In a statement by the Grand London Administrative Board (GLA) that Mr. Acully had been in favour of the Prime Minister's friendly relationship with him and that the GLA's supervisor had recorded "what to do" about the Prime Minister's actions.
"What's about action" is if there's information that shows that there's a possibility of crime."
It's not just that this has never been proved.
IOPC will examine whether this item needs to be examined.
This issue was addressed to IOPC, but IOPC is an agency that responds to reports issued to the English and Welsh police.
The problem was that Mr. Johnson was in charge of the police officers' service at the time.
Mr. Johnson has denied the wrongs associated with the friendship with Mr. Ackery.
First of all, although Mr. Johnson claims to be "distinct," he said that he was going to follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about Mr. Aquely's relationship.
While this statement was reported by Sandetimes, it was reported that seven years ago, Mr. Aqutley, who moved to London, paid 126,000 pounds of gold from the mayor of London in the days of the London City, and received three times the preference for his participation in the foreign trade unions.
Since then, the government has spent 100,000 pounds on Hackerhouse's research company.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process that was carried out before the aid was paid.
Mr. Matt Walman in the basement, the digital province went "normally correct" and its company said it owns the English phone number.
However, according to many reports, the phone number was transferred to the California office, where Mr. Acully (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "the public secret between the employees."
The GLA's move to take the Prime Minister to the police surveillance office touched the Prime Minister's anger.
The top government officials say it's a "political attack" and the timing of the Pre-Access Conference was "very party-based".
"In any case, the Board of Supervisors has not provided any evidence and has not given the Prime Minister the opportunity to respond to the Board of Supervisors, which was issued late on Friday evening."
Nationals and Mascomi will see very little of the political crazy language that has been developed since then.
First of all, the standard newspaper heard that the relationship between London's visual and regional incentives supported by Johnson and California's staff was "public secret" between the staff.
The president of London's L&P said that even though Mr. Ackerly was considered to be "trustable" at the time, he wanted to have the privilege of accompanying Mr. Johnson's business contacts abroad.
The security fund that the generals can use to create wealth!
This is a 20-year-old Moningster.
I've just heard from the postmaster's chief of staff.
I've been here for 20 years since I set up this year.
What's going on in 20 years?
First of all, in 20 years of history, there was a lot of thinking and effort.
I would like to express my deep appreciation for all the ways in which we are involved, not only in the history that has been accomplished with the "new fund."
And I thought, "I'm going to support the economy of the common people."
This spirit hasn't changed, and it's been stupid for 20 years.
If the general ways of solving money's insecurity, we think that the world's future will be clear from the ground, and we encourage the whole community to work day by day.
In the long term, it doesn't make sense that the performance should not be shared with the beneficiaries.
We're going to have a lot of money when we're going to get out of here, like Remanshock and Itbble.
"That's why we're here to support the businesses we need in the world," I feel that you understand the message we've been asking for every day.
It's because it's been a 20-year-old long-term fund, and it's still a long-term system that can be delivered in many ways.
We've opened every investment firm, money and cost in the last month's report.
And I'm going to tell you what's going on, and I'm going to say, what's going to happen to you now, and I'm going to get you a black box, but I'm going to show you what you're buying.
And that's why we've been trusting.
Mac Miller's death, the three-person drug arresters' keys.
Losanzells (AP communication) - three men were arrested for a drug crime involving Mr. Mac Miller of Lapar last year who had died of drug abuse.
According to the Court's record, Stephen Walter had a suspicion that Mr. Miller had taken cocaine, alcohol, and pentanil before he died, but he was a powerful opioid drug that had spread to thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of offering a drug to one of the other people who sold it to Mr. Miller.
According to a court record published on Friday, Petitt was taking drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Reeves, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Habasiti, Arizona, was questioned about the drug being sent to Petit as Walter's "partner".
There are no direct crimes against Mr. Miller's deaths, and there is no objection to the various cases.
Walter, who is currently in detention, has been convicted for five months because he was in custody in a drug incident in 2005.
The investigators who hold the document originally reported by the Seleb website TMZ on Monday ask that Walter be kept until the trial begins because of the very high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone message in the lawyer's office.
Petit was prosecuted at the Federal Court of Justice on 4 September, but the lawyer refused the comment.
In Miller's song, there's a direct word about the use of drugs, and in the hip hop, I've got a fan in the big place.
Miller, born in Pittsburgh, Malcolm James Mayers Macomik, was in contact with the singer's two-year relationship with Aliana Grande in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande wrote his own favorite movie of Miller in his own program and published a love song about Miller, called "Sunku Next".
Miller is also one of the musicians who died from opioid drug abuse in recent years.
The Rockband3Dars Down Guitarist Mashu Roberts also died from drug overdoses in 2016, and Fentanyl and Hydrocodone are found in the body.
In this article, Stephen, not Steven's name, was modified by Walter.
Nigeria's 9-year-old, more than 30 mobile games.
The 9-year-old is making a lot of games using the Scratch2 free software program.
Using Scratch2, you can make games, animations, and stories in online mode.
I've been using this app for over 30 years, and I've created more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game that's programmed to hide the puzzle.
The player gets a point to catch a comedy from the hiding place.
I learned how to build a game in a short time frame.
Bazillu told CNN, "I'm spending time playing when I'm depressed."
In March, my father applied for a short-term conference for children aged 5 to 15.
This presentation of the Codfest International Academy was directed to give children such as Bazil to access new technologies such as robotics and dreaming.
According to his father's father, Bazil Okpara Sinai said that Bazil had grown up in most mobile games.
"Bazill always took the phone and played the game, and when he was four, he bought a tablet.
Candy Krash and Temple Ran did it."
But because of the fact that you're only playing a little bit of a game, I'm interested in the production of a baseball game at seven years of age.
"One day, I used to make a table like that, but I was really dreaming of the game, and I was a little tired," he said.
And he said, "I'm always playing games, but how about you make a game yourself like everyone else?"
When I said that I was angry, I didn't think Bazil would be interested."
Since then, a little basil who was interested in learning how to build his game, he asked his parents to buy a laptop and recorded it in the first lesson of the game production.
Bazil, who wants to become a scientist, has a very good name for his game.
One of the games, "Moscite Mass" can be played in a Google player.
Young people in Africa are the highest in the world, while young people in Africa are the highest in the world.
Recently, two 12-year-olds in Nigeria have developed a robot that uses the software code to take care of the family.
In May, in the 2019 Robofest Context, acrobott's high school team, which was programmed for the boxing of the robot, won.
Africa's large technology companies, including Google and Microsoft, are increasing their investment in Africa, and the children of the same age are trying to become the star of future programming.
I'm a member of the Noscaloline Joint Party, and I'm convinced that the charges are false in the investigation.
According to a document of the Court of Justice presented at the Tribunal, it is hoped that the President of the Noscaloline Joint Party has proved false to the federal agent who conducted the investigation of the main political donors.
In a list of cases in the Federal Court of Justice, Robin Hayes is making a criminal response on Sunday.
According to a document signed by Heise's lawyer, Heise was aware that he was reporting false statements to FBI agents during the 2018 investigation.
In fact, there is no record of the fact that the court proceedings have been signed and that the document based on the facts does not state which crimes Heise accepts.
Hayes was told at the time of the conspiracy, the conspiracy, the conspiracy, and the false statements.
The investigators told him that he was involved in the insurance company's plan to introduce the election award to the State Security Supervisors to return to special treatment.
Greg Lindberg, two of the co-founders, were told without hesitation to the chief security officer of the state of Mike Cozzi.
Lindberg has been the founder of insurance and investment companies and has been offering over $5 million to state and federal electoral candidates and commissions since 2016, and in recent years it has become the state's top political contributor.
Lindberg supported the ideas and politicians of the Common Party, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
I didn't reply to a lawyer in Lindberg who asked for a comment on e-mail.
On Friday, I didn't answer the request for more comments on the e-mail.
In a document of the verdict presented at the Tribunal, it is reported that Heise lied to FBI agent in August 2018, but he said he did not speak to Kodzi about the State Security Agency's staff.
However, in fact, a document based on the fact that Heise was actually talking about human rights dependence on State Security Officers and Lindberg security agencies.
The investigation also said that Heise wanted to help Lindberg's reliance on Kodzi and Mitting, and that he spoke with the supervisor about the direct assault.
The charges published in April claim that Lindberg sought special treatment in his insurance business, and that he was planning to postpone the 2020-year election campaign aimed at a maximum of $2 million in Kozzi.
According to the prosecution, the investigation involved the replacement of the authorities who were investigating Lindberg's company.
Cozy, a member of the community, informed the federal agent of his undisputed suspicions and helped with the position.
There's no doubt in Kodzi.
In a interview involving Lindberg and Kozzi, the prosecution reported that the co-founder of Lindberg had instructed Heise to pay $250,000 for the re-election of Kozi.
According to the prosecution, Hayes had initially argued that if he moved so much money, he would pay attention to it, but that it ended in conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "Whatever you want to do."
"All right, I'll do it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Office has not responded to the request for detailed information on the legal negotiations on the e-mail.
Facebook, look for the happiness of the user, please!
In the first world attempt to bring the user happiness, some of the users will not yet be able to print the other people! The number of people who saw the video will not be visible.
In July, this change will continue with the same test as an installation programme in Australia, but it will not be seen as a personal user.
This new Facebook experiment is started in the golden corner, and it's scheduled to start in Australia.
Meia Garrick, a political leader in Facebook Australia, said that this change is based on the Fideback of Central Wales, which seems to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "There was a very positive feedback from the reaction group and the central heroes because of the many connections."
The user is just removing the numbers so that you can focus on the contents of the exchange and content rather than the number of the shares.
He said that rather than feeling competitive, the user is expected to be safer and more secure in this platform.
Garrick also claimed that businessmen who are making Facebook have access to the same metrics as they used to.
It has been a long time since Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland have carried out the same test.
The Facebook plugin does not announce whether this test will be finished or it has been modified.
"There was also the first positive feedback on the experience of the Instagram, but now there is a lesson to be learned from the Fideback."
Garrick, in Australia, the World Research Institute, pointed out that Australia had a very positive "technology"-generated "feisbook" and an instagrem user.
My colleague, Australia, thought this was a valuable experience for people, or not, a really good country to get a good feedback.

Despite the noise, there was a voice of joy in Japan's big gold star.
"Miracles! I can't believe it" was a member of the company who was watching out-of-house monitors in the Grand Minami Valley.

One day, my mother's favorite bag of money was taken away, and she didn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bags are destroyed, I'd like to make some adjustments and continue to use them.
He helped me at that time, but he was a hand-carp party in Canada.
"I don't know if I'm selling it anymore."
My mother's broken bag, it's a real pizza.
So when we asked for repairs to the hotel, it became a matter of increasing our own price.

I was impressed when I found it in the manual counter.
It's 100, but it's not enough.
It's like a part used for keylders and champ DIY.
So we're going to have to do it on both sides of the baghandle.
If you look at the size of the ring, it's a little bit smaller, and it looks like the other side of the piece, it's exactly the same thing.
This is the way to fix the bug.

So I'm going to draw the line twice.
I'm going to add more money to it, but it's not really a problem.
Instead, we're going to have a lot of cracks, and we're going to have to go up to the level of design.
"Asu" in the state-of-the-state emergency car is a book called "Asu" and "Atoise" for a 0-hour tour.
I'm waiting for the JR to get out of the island.
People who enjoyed the trip of a train that took the "Asu" in the summer of the country.
In the 28-day season of the nation's emergency, the train was carried out in the middle of the island.
About 240 people in Candolafan traveled from the island to the last two-year-old red car and went out for about 0 hours in the morning.
Assus is a night train that's closed in 950's, the blue book and Tokyo.
The event took place in "Go to Restriction (two days) and is part of the "Bruth Distribution Camp", which is part of Japan's tour of the JR companies.
The train is connected to a passenger car and a motorbike, and it's 7 of them, and it runs along the mountain lines, the railways, and the islands.

Mr. Candile Barouch, SNS Star, Pakistan.
Mr. Candile Barouch, who was introduced to the Social Media, was murdered in July 2016.
One of the people of Pakistan's social media, Mr. Candile Baroque's brother, was convinced of the murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to the most outstanding "nameless killer" in Pakistan.
The high level of self-sustainment is not what has grown up in the U.S. standard, but has been triggered by a very strong Pakistani vision, and a famous Baroque was murdered in July 2016.
My brother Muhammad Washington was arrested.
He said, "Of course, he killed the sister, and she didn't let her act," and he didn't regret what she did.
Mr. Salder Memud, a lawyer, told the AFP that the court of the city of Malta had sent a criminal case against Usim as a result of the pending trial.
"Inshaler will be innocent in the Supreme Court," said the lawyer.
First of all, Mrs. Baroque's mother, Annawal May, told the AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There's no sin on my son.
My daughter and my son."
As Mr. Baroque's murder became a world news, and as he despised the rights of his father's society, the victim is again fueled by a voice calling for action against the extension of the so-called ‘nameless killer’.
In the case of Mrs. Webaroch, who chooses to marry herself, a woman has been shot, shot, shot or killed in a crime like that she called her sexistity and raped her family.
The murder will be executed by a close parent.
Then, by the Caesar of Pakistan and by the law of Dija, the victim can ask for forgiveness from the victim's relatives.
Three months after Mr. Baroque's murder, the Parliament passed a new bill binding the death penalty on the famous killer.
However, if the murderer is guilty of a reputation, the judge's judgment is based on the fact that the murderer can claim another motive on the theory and can be forgiven.
In the case of Mr. Baroque, the first parents claimed that they would not forgive their son.
But the parents, who were sorry to lose their son, said that they wanted to change their mind and apologize to their son.
In the face of international hatred for murder, the Pakistani government has been an example of saying that both parents and the country are a successor, but the complaint has continued.
In the famous behavior of Mr. Barot, it's about the fact that he offered to expose the strippers to the Pakistani cricket team, and that he used a very red dress that had been wide open to Barentinde.
Criticism and threats, however, have been recognized by many people, including young people, in a country that is considered to be a political activity that is a major cause of women's status.
Ruth's "name" killer is a national social rule that still remains widespread in South Asia and is particularly affected by the actions of women, but men are also victims.

"Shitbox" was set up at the "Growds of the "Old Minds" in the escape site of the Medieval Medieval Crowd.
On the four self-governing events in the city of Huang Hei, which were hit by the earthquake in June, the Mountain Journalists are sending out a 5-kiln box (approach of approximately 1 million dollars) to Aluminum refugees with 1600 anti-heat sites.
We're going to set up a "one-time shelter" in the coastal areas.
On the second day of the month, the first refugee camp in the Pacific will be held in the "Graound of Old Minds" area.
They are affected by earthquakes in a city that is bound by an agreement, and are protected by the most recent anti-hazardous self-government sites in the Himalayas.
The shipment is first sent to the Himalayas (400) and to the Himalayas (500, to the Nebux2k) in the morning (300, to the Box 1k) (400, to the Box 2k) (to the self-governs).
When the earthquake struck, many of the people of the coastal region of Japan were warned of the tsunami and avoided it.
He fled to a refugee camp, which was set up as high as all the councils in the city of Zhao.
Most refugees were not able to move to a place of refuge that had two possible shelters, and many of the shelters were heard to complain of hunger for one time.
As a preparation for the same disaster, the response of the storm and the wind became one of the issues.

In addition, as a training guide for all kinds of competitions, both groups are actively involved in the work they are doing, and the children of the island will be able to establish a system of mutual support when they are away from the island.
When both groups do what they say about sports, they send a special trainer and a speaker together and share information.
When the team of the island team is away from an island convention, the trainer will be involved in any issue resolution that would be consistent with the cost of travel.
In particular, during the General Assembly's district conventions, the ASA is connected to the General Society's Sports Centre, which is called the General Society's Sports Centre, and provides support to prevent the low-fashioned and low-fashioned popularity of the players on the ship.

In the north-west of Nigeria, more than 40,000 refugees: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
According to the U.S. statement on Friday, the number of refugees from north-eastern Nigeria has increased by an increase in violence in the last four months.
According to the U.S. National Refugee Agency, this conflict has created a "new humanitarian crisis" and it will require a new $35.5 million fund-raising activity by the end of the year.
UNHCR's babar Baroque journalist said that the Islamic extremist organization Bokoham, who has been active in northern Nigeria for 10 years, is not involved in a number of recent armed attacks.
Rather, during the past 10 months, violent violence in Sokoto, Nigeria, Samfarah, and Katina has been organized by armed groups.
"We have a great deal of fear of the state of illegality and insecurity," said journalist Baroque on Friday, and she told reporters.
The reporter said that rape, rape, murder, and sexual violence were common, and the attackers were destroying their homes and stealing.
The military and police are also being sent to the crime organization in the area.
But the army is embroiled in a war with the Islamic West African Ministry of West Africa, which broke up in Bokoharm and the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't want to name the group," said Mr. Baroque.
What they're carrying is a terrible physical experience.
Most of the refugees are moving to Nigeria.
UNHCR declared that, particularly in the state of Sokoto, the situation had deteriorated, and that refugees who moved to Niger had announced that there would be an increase in the coming months.
A new court date for a man who killed two women and children.
The trial date of a Guatemalan man who was murdered by a woman in Iowa and her two children was confirmed.
According to the record of the Park Court of Justice, Marvin Escobal Oleanna (31) was charged with the murder of the first three cases on behalf of the first police known by the authorities as Marvin Esciebel Lopes.
He claims to be innocent.

In the Court's record, it's time to decide the court's date again on the 27th of May, and to prepare for more than two lawyers of the accused.
According to the authorities of the U.S. Immigration Service, Escobal Oleanna was illegal in the United States and was sent twice before this gun.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.

This service provides an effective release of DSP "Logicad" from the media company.
Hederbyding is a way to give priority to a high-value advertising campaign in a number of bidders (declaration firms).
It's a solution that is more transparent for the media, which can be expected to improve profits, and it's an attempt to get the media into the center.
So far, the "Logicad" has provided an interview with SSP on advertising.
In recent years, in order to meet the expectations of "I want to cooperate with a particular advertising scheme in particular business, brandy and parenting," the media company has launched a direct sale of advertising advertising that was intended for the advertising company since December last year.
Now, in response to head-by-heading, LFP's leadership is being expanded.
As advertising director Merit, it is possible to participate directly in the advertising campaign through the LFP's headvising response, and can be expected on top of the advertising credit opportunity.

Japan's Telecommunications Agency (Jetro) is developing a business that supports the growth of small businesses through the external Internet.
It's an attempt to direct the sale to the external consumer by setting up a specific Japanese counter on the external site and presenting products from all over the country.
The company's claim is more than a thousand companies, and it is in China and South-East Asia.
It's called Japann MALL last year.
It's the main objective of small businesses with no way to the sea, and it's going to delay the development of a world of chemicals, beverages, and products.
It's possible to sell on 24 large hand-held sites, such as the U.S. and the Middle East, with Jethro.
A 30-year-old man from the Mei Canpas service in Pawahara.
As there were Pawahara's violent words against the students, the mayor announced that on 27 days he had sentenced 30-year-old male teachers to 2 months in Michacampas (Michaen City).
It's the same date.
According to the Department of Public Health, since October 2017, male assistants have been able to express their feelings when directing a number of students in the study room, and they have repeatedly resorted to violent words, such as inappropriate words, and gave strong stress.
It's Pawahara, the head of education, and it's found to have damaged the educational environment.
There was a complaint from several students in a survey carried out on September 18.
In addition to the Department of Technology's management of the Department of Sciences, since December the students and teachers have been conducting a study in the Halasment Conciliation Commission by members of the Microcampas, and has finally applied for Halasment from one of the students.
As a result of the investigation by the Co-Committee, he decided to award a trial with the chief of the mountains and the chief of staff.
And even after Anquet, male assistants continued to be educated, but their actions have been improved through the conversation until now, and they're saying, "I didn't apologize."
The school principal said, "I'm going to start with the victim, and I'm going to ask him to take all the lessons and try to get back to trust."
At the same time, the Ministry of Science's male teachers have continued their internal investigation of what is suspected of having sex with girls who are leading them.
In order to reduce the EU's demand for the removal of internal conflicts and to bring the EU into line with the EU, Boris Johnson asked Mr. Sa Sanpaper.
It's only been three weeks until the final EU summit, and now it's too late for the Prime Minister to take the lead.
Mr. Boris Johnson is facing internal conflicts that call for the EU to withdraw from the EU and seek to bring it into line with the EU.
The deal is about a new tax system that replaces backstop in Ireland, and the EU considers Mr. Johnson's replacement "unimplementable".
The top ministers hope that the dark screens of the EU of the German Prime Minister Angela Melkel will propose a three-year settlement on the backstop of the security party, which will be held by the German Prime Minister Angela Melkel.
Sa Sanja has heard about three people who are going to deal with the Prime Minister after the last year of the Conservative Party's meeting in Manchester.
They're demanding that the Prime Minister ask Dominic Kamings to leave the EU and threaten to abandon the "extraordinary strategy" and claim that the EU will accept an invitation to issue over time.
One of the speakers said that the decision to close the meeting on the day of the Supreme Court was an illegal one, and in the present case, the only way we could escape on "3 September".
We will not be overcome by numbers in the underground chambers, but they are against us.
The Prime Minister must take advantage of what he can do more than walk.
It doesn't work, but the Kamings project is clearly failing.
You can't fight in so many areas.
The other party, however, promised to talk to Mr. Johnson about the implementation of the Prime Minister's agreement.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I'm going to tell Boris I'm going to go back to Teriza's office."
And that's why there's a lot going on, and no one's trying to get this over with anything.
If you don't delay, Boris is over, and we're all over.
John Major said that Boris didn't really think about the deal.
The Premier Party's leader is speaking to us in a loud voice, "The Prime Minister wants to conclude an agreement with the EU.
However, we do not see the fact that the Prime Minister is in a position to negotiate with the EU and to establish an agreement.
Instead, we have seen that the Prime Minister in Scotland fought against the bull and the bull, tested the bull in Wales, and argued mainly against the people of the country. "
The Prime Minister's reporters admitted yesterday that the agreement was still in progress, "If anyone achieves a goal that must be different, it's still longer."
However, when the journalist left, again, the law on re-examination of three months, in Brussels, said, "the situation of our trade is very weak."
The journalist said, "This bill is certainly a barrier to our relationship, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to continue their efforts, even though they have created it."
The U.S. Secretary-General Steven Barclay will return to Brussels today for the agreement with the EU's Michel Barnies.
They discuss documents on how regionalizations of the entire island of Ireland can work on food and feed.
Lorain, Kelly, I told you that the glass gorillas will never succeed on TV.
Lorain, Kelly found out that in the glass box, she said that she was "never successful."
Before we first appeared on the TV, Kelly, 59, said she'd been back in the shipping industry for 35 years.
"I'm still 25 years old, and I'm very stressed," she says.
I was working as an investigator at BBC Scotland, and I was told that your high-ranking supervisor would never succeed on television.
I went to London to see all the TV-am teams before I left in the Grasgo office, and to see where the show was sent.
I'll never forget that Korean, Diamond, and Mike Morris were interviewing a historian's wife, Olivia, and Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as the living story.
I knew where I wanted to be.
Kelly started working as a local journalist in East Scotland, and in 984, she became a TV-amscotland journalist.
Then Kelly took over the board of directors such as the GMTV, the ITV's BlackFost, and the Debrick, and then started calling her name, Lorain.
I remember about 35 years, and I'll send you a special program that will turn into the most memorable event in Kelly's memory and the interview.
"Love and enthusiasm" and "inquiry" were the secret to stay in the television industry, and the president added, "I have to put it into work."
You must be honest and honest.
To do what we should do, to be interested in many people, and to be interested in them.
And he turned back to the news that had been shot in his heart, and Kelly discovered that the arrests on the Danblene bombings were "very hard."
"On the day of the terrible event that six students and teachers were killed, we had no idea that many of the families of the children who had been killed or injured had been killed.
The mother's mother, Pam, who was killed by five daughter Joanna, said that Rose wanted to meet me personally, so we had to talk to her at her house for hours.
I'm going to Joanna's funeral, and Pam and I've been friends ever since.
Kelly also interviewed her husband when Kate and Gary Macan's wife, Madeleine's daughter, went missing in 2007, but she said, "It was very strange," and she said, "I really respect my wife's strength and courage."
It's important that a couple have to cope with the stress and the networks that they don't know what's happening to their beloved daughter.
My wife's not really hurt.
The 35th anniversary of Lorain will be sent to the ITV from 8 to 30 p.m. on Monday, 30 September.
Jinbabe, Cheunga, who was afraid of the storm.
According to government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga has concluded that it may be disturbing to follow the military action of November 2017 by President Robert Mgabe in his political transition.
While the negotiations between the Qudets continued between Magabe and the National Defence Army, Magabe announced that he would take over the presidential office in Chienga, the Zimbabwean Indian newspaper reported last week.
However, the reason that Chiwenga's proposal was rejected is not because of the uncertainty, but because he saw the idea of using Chienga in order to inform the leaders of the world's leaders and the African Union that the government's superiors are reporting on social media.
In a tweet from Jamwanda2, which confirmed that the authorities were the highest in the House of Presidents, "Magabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is going to take over the government to Chienga instead of Emerson Munagawa," it is reported that a strong deal was being made about this.
Magabe, who was aware of the lack of power, made a contact with the Ambassador to Cheenga, and the government authorities are speaking.
According to government officials, the military commander's arbitration was conducted by three former Presidents.
George Charanba, President of Spokesman, was involved in the transaction by Aaron Nepera and Roman Catholic theologian Fidelis Mkonoli, who was then represented by the Central Information Agency.
Gideon Gono of the Zimbabwe Banking Board is one who is commissioned by Magabe to report the delegation of the President of the Zimbabwean Defence Force (ZDF) to Governor Chiwenga alone.
Mgabe, who became a symbol of Africa before his death, tried to blame the African Union for his military actions, seeking an intervention by the leaders of African countries.
The presidential appointment to the CDF (Chienga Commander) was not the result of the presidential election (Magabe).
"So I started to get tired of some of the president's family and I was leaving my life to save the situation so quickly," writes the former president.
I just wanted to change the flow, at least diplomatic, so there was little political turmoil in the president's office.
If it's like destroying the law order, it's been going to conflict with the views and views of the African Union on the co-deter, but I want to remind you that the authorities have declared it not to be broken or to be broken.
So the President (Magabe) was waiting for a statement by the commanders who claimed that there was no violation of the rule of law at the time of the military summit.
The President (Magabe) therefore wanted the African Union, which decided whether to place the whole situation as a codator, not to mention it as a codator, but to consider military intervention requirements to be appropriate.
It was the idea and the calculation of the basis of this offer.
When they realized that they were not protected by the Defense Army, Magabé moved, and the authorities were talking.
He's warned that he would be punished like Kadafi in the army, and he's not gonna get Magabe to write his resignation.
The military commanders told Magabe that even though they were going to enter the capital, they were not going to shoot the citizens.
At the time, Magabé wanted to protect his family and prove two of his military forces.
The commanders and the commanders of the day were reading it directly.
A powerful statement was used by the President's envoy (Gono) to say, "Iss Tili Bekawapa Makwapa (we belong to the army) and we are not even in political competitions if we are not politicians."
The army told the other commanders of the area, through a military officer who was staying in Zimbabwe, that the purpose was not to break into Magab and take him away from the "criminals" and that the government officials were speaking.
And Magabe tried to call back the same way that Monagawa, who had recently died in South Africa to talk to him about the curator and the successor.
In addition to the border with the army, Magabe needed regional support.
The fact that President Jacob Zma was then president of the South African Development Community was not only prepared for economic and territorial power but also made it clear that the South Africans, who were the key to this process, refused to intervene, and that if the army entered the capital, they would be sent directly to Harare.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, it wasn't really enough," says the information to the Indian newspaper.
In the United States, the United States has been declared a nuclear ban.
At the 26th meeting of the U.S. Department of Nuclear Weapons in New York, a meeting was held in New York City.
On this day, 5 countries have ratified the nuclear ban treaty and 32 countries have become territories.
In order to activate the article, we need the approval of 50 Canadians.
The meeting and ratification were accompanied by an international date for the total disappearance of nuclear weapons on 26 days.
The President of the Getels office also spoke out and expressed his strong appreciation that in recent years nuclear weapons and non-proliferation have been a factor.
I said, "I'm not going to give up."
China needs strong leadership, or it's a policy document.
China needs strong leadership by the Communist Party, but rather the country will be "destroyed," and the Chinese Government said in a policy paper published on Friday, the 70th anniversary of the construction of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, China's National Bureau reported that the success of the Communist Party as a government since 70 years ago was the result of the party's leadership.
China is wide and complex, but most of the problems of governance cannot be seen.
If there is no strong leadership, China is going to be divided and broken, and it will be a big deal in the world."
China's authorities have been making long-term justifications for dealing with the problem in a strong way, as did the democratic movement in Beijing, which took place in 989.
On the day of the fire, the powerful prince of the world's Second World Economic and Social Council, who has been exercising power over the party since late 2012, has been actively taking over the people who rebel against the party.
The usual has also supervised the modernized military program that threatens the area.
China is not going to export its development models, it is not going to get another model, it is simply seeking peace without a right.
Among the ethnicities of the Chinese people, there is no aggression or global domination of other peoples.
In recent times, China has been subjected to pressure, and war and confusion have left a deep impression on its suffering, and China will never be able to blame others for the pain it has experienced.
China is responding to a year's memory when it is not safe in the United States in the hard-of-the-fashion war, and is facing a difficult problem, such as low-sound and anti-government movements in Hong Kong.
The White Paper says that China will never give up its core interests and will not allow security and sovereignty to be lost.
"There is no solution to the problem of continuing the threat of civil war," says the White Paper on the dispute with Washington.
China is a fully-fledged industrial system, a fully industrial chain, a broad market space and a strong economic development.
"Never weaken in the light of war." The White Paper said.
China is facing difficulties, is convinced that it has the power to change the crisis into a chance and open a new world.
China has no idea how to fight against the United States, and I don't think it's going to change for the United States, so America should slow down China's development.
America can't control China, and it's less likely to stop China's development.
If we control other countries and force them to move their conflicts abroad, they won't be able to maintain their strength.
[ High School Balls] High-level commander of peace, disbanding the Chief of Gold, and bringing out a report of violence.
In the summer, a five-year-old high-ranking high-ranking college football champion announced a 28-day settlement between the District Guard (36) and the Prime Minister of China (42) on the same date.
The Minister (responsive teacher) is now in charge of the High Mountain Court, and is about to decide quickly.
On 26 days, the Department of the Interior reported that the map had been a terrorist to the football team.
When the school was heard from two people, the District Guard had the head of the student, and the chief of gold admitted some of the violence.
I've been working on the results of a survey of 66 students, and I've been doing a real check on two more people, and I've got 28 days to accept the truth.
"In five years of summer, the pre-student (74) who grew up in the city of São Paulo (now) was courageous.
He's been the director of the field, and he's been the chief of gold.
"For six to three years, he went out to the summer fields, and now he went out to the spring Sembats.
But when the summer was finally hit by the comparison of the summer, the summer was suddenly hit by the summer, and the summer's summer season was hopeless.
Mel C of Spicegars, who has suffered from foodborne diseases, has been banned from talking about diet in the family.
The Meranie Chisum of Spicegars admitted that for many years we have not eaten anything except fruit and vegetables, and that they have banned diets in their families from eating their own food.
Sports Piss, under the president of the world's pop group, has continued to "exacitate until late in the year, and was later diagnosed with eating disorders.
Chisom says his experience is also affecting the baby of a baby girl, and he found out that everything about diet in the family is forbidden."
"Scarlett is now 10 years old, and it's time to focus on the outside," says Mel.
But because of the food disturbances, she was very concerned about her speech when she was talking to her.
A word that goes forward, it's a habit now.
In the 1990s, who was known as a member of Spicegars, who had not yet been in the SNS table, and who had been involved in the problem of the "bad" comment on herself written in Moscow, Mel said in an interview with Women's Health.
"I couldn't see my face in a little bit, and I had a certain set of food, and it was as if I had taken it to a lot of exacisity, and it was too rough."
I've had a bad feeling, and I've been in this condition for years.
I'm going to go to the North Sea News, and I'm going to have to ask you what to do with the electronics.
In the complaint that the "real marriage" was to be formed in the same sex, the Department of Justice of the United Nations decided to accept this.
There are more than 20 countries that approve of homosexuality, and there is no legal force within the country, but there is a system for self-governing such as the U.S. party chips.
That's what the judge said, and he recognized the reality of the wedding of two women.
It's like the first court ruling that recognized the legal protection of the gay capple.
The claim that it is a violation of the rules of civil law and of the law on marriage is a violation of the laws of nationality and of the law of nationality is made in 5 courts, such as abortion.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of minors, and to deepen the debate on the way in which there is a legal system that recognizes many families.
Women have been together for about seven years and have obtained marriage certificates in the United States, but they have been destroyed by an act of impunity, and the prosecutor has appealed for damage to the partners.
The court recognized the fact that two people were in common with the fact that they were married to each other and that there was no change in the fact that they were married to each other.
The recognition of the right to a marriage as a social security is a figurative decision that extends to the same sex.
More importantly, the resolution of the 24th Act, which called marriage "the only ground for mutual agreement", was "the freedom of marriage."
It's a two-year-old, and it's a two-year-old who's not supposed to be married.
It is expected that "the law does not create the same marriage," which prohibits or prohibits a government that does not explain whether it is committed, and is expected to be the pursuit of the same-sex marriage in all the world.
On the other hand, because of the fact that the same marriage is not recognized as being different from the benefits of legal protection between men and women, the issue remains.
Even if we recognize the reality of equality between men and women, we are not bound by the right to defend ourselves.
Women who have been married have also changed the conscience of their citizens, as people who have said that they should approve of the same marriage by law.
As the diversity of lifestyles progresses, the law is based on traditional family images, and the rights of people who can't get it.
The fact that marriage is not a legal "wife" does not make a difference in the tax system, nor does it have a common right, nor does it still have a lot of power.
In the same marriage, there is a need to look at family law from different perspectives, both in terms of the right to an actual marriage and in terms of the right to it.
A few women's strong suspicions about the trial of Azrite's trial and the trial of the trial.
The trial is carried out by a judge of a football player at the University of Idea, who is accused of committing sexual acts against a number of women.
"On Friday, when the witness and the debate were finished, Judge Cray Konawei began to comment on the execution.
"The only woman says that after she drove Conway into her home, she was sexually abused.
The two of them put their faces together, and they met in the site binball three weeks later, when Conawey sent her photos to a woman.
Konawei is asked about six sexual crimes against women between 20-3 and 20-8 years, but she is one of them.
The investigators claimed that the woman was opposed when Escarlet and Konawei tried to rape women.
The attorneys follow the woman's claims and memory differences, and they say that she was regretting her relationship with the body.

Despite the cost of Sydney's $210 million a year in Australia's economy, Sydney Harbor is the largest leader in the opera house, Sacular Key, Lunapark, and a famous Harvard.
But there's a terrible truth under the bridge.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways in Australia, where about 15 percent of the pollutants in the Olympics are in circulation each year.
Because of this statistics, one of our biggest sights is to say one of the most unclean places.
From Sydney Harbor down to the bottom, according to a new title, Australia's most popular urban waterway, the drinking water, the binoculars, the pet-bottles, the no-one's fats, and the animals' clothes -- all of them flow into Sydney Harbor through the water that flowed through the road.
It's the biggest reason for the waterway in the inside.
In fact, in a film released on September 27th of the world's view, Dr. Cassary Duffon, Deputy Director of the Sydney Harbor Research Program, says "This is a paradox."
It's really beautiful, but it's one of the rivers that we've changed and contaminated in the coastal borders of the country.
According to CSIRO, the plastics of 1560 kilograms are always seen to flow into the water, most of which are flown into Sydney Harbor because of the flow of water.
"The hot rain fell a few times, but then Sydney Harbor was... terrible," said Dr. Daffon.
Two thirds of the contamination are flown from the water that flowed through the road.
But like one corner of the hill, the more serious problem is that 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the sea under this Sydney Harbor are buried on the bottom of the sea.
"I don't really think we should go to the sea, but I don't know what's going on there or what's not true," said Dibsenter Manley, Richard Nichols of Onner.
And I think that if most people know what's going on in the water, they're really going to get together.
It's complicated, but it's more than half of what we find out.
We're using at least half of the remaining plastics.
No one can believe that Sidney Harbor is looking forward to seeing one, and that all of these plastics and straws are running down the water right away.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders of the Osan Project, said that he could reduce the plastics and straws that flow into the water, even to the local residents and visitors.
"We should start from the origin," he says.
We're going to reduce the use of plastics, and we're going to risk better, and eventually we're going to go to the sea, so we're not going to get any more awareness of what's going on in the water.
Because 50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the sea, and it's going to kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of the carbon dioxide, and it's a food source.
But we'll repair Sydney Harbor and bring it back to the old face, but it's very simple.
It's not about killing the sea. It's about killing people.
This month, a new study on plastics and mentalls was published by TOMRA, a group of activities that are widely known to the Australians for environmental protection and for the reduction of the effects of the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of children between 12 and 18 years of age and 546 are disappointed about plastics, and 25 percent think that plastics are a major cause.
In the same study, the Plastik problem was linked to the 4th floor of the memory item, and 93 percent of the 551 people surveyed said that their parents felt themselves insecure about the amount of Plastik's entry into the sea.
Most of the students said they wanted something about plastics, but they didn't know how to change it, and that was an eating disorder.

I've been told that I've been a TV channel for about 120 percent to try, and I've been told that it's a book, and when I'm really hurt, my father said, "I don't think it's a book, but I'm not.
And then, in the age of 2-3 years, it was just a job to say, "If anyone's a girl who's free," that's not going to work, and when the heart was broken, I said, "Do the job that anyone should do, and if anyone wants to do it, it's good to take care of it.

The World War II (WRC) ruling in Japan in November 2020.
The International Automotive Union (FIA) announced the launch of the FIA World War II (WRC) in Japan on November 22, 2020, on September 27, 2019.
Returns the last WRC World War II power to the picture!
(18)
Japan's launch was not the last time it was launched in the North Sea in 2010.
What's going to happen to the WRC that was resurrected in 2020?
The WRC is one of the four world elections under the auspices of the International Automotive Union (FIA).
Since 1973 it has been the world's highest-ranking and traditional larry of choice, and if the technology is closed, it is said that it is more violent to travel on a wide range of roads, such as railways and snow roads.
In June 2018, Toyota returned to the 2nd session and received a WRC manual highlight title since 1999 and became a big issue.
This time, the Japanese Board of Appeals was launched to launch a sad Japanese campaign.
As a result, the World Motor Sports Council, the International Automobile Union (FIA), which is the highest resolution agency, decided to launch a 2020 WRC Japanese round.
As for the Japanese launch, the two knowledge of the famous Xiao Xiao Xiao, and the representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, the head of the captain of the team, Toyota Automotive Service, is speaking as follows:
● Love for the Master of the Big Town.
"I welcome the 2020 Japan launch of the FIA World War II (WRC), which represents Japan's center of motor sports, and is working together with the world's major players, and is working towards the success of the 2020 Congress."
- I don't know, Mr. Gutten.
"When the Tokyo Olympic Paralympic Competition Conference was launched in 2020, it is a great surprise that Japan's World War II power will be launched here in the "Climate Country" -- the first World Motor Sports conference to be held, and it's a great deal of fun, and it's waiting for you all to come."
● TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT Representative, Head of the Service Department of the Automobiles of Toyota
"I'm very happy to have Yaris WRC run in Japan.
I'm still asking you for help."
Also, on the launch of Japan's round, many participants, including President of the Motorsport Union, are commenting on the launch of the Japanese rounds.
The WRC World Lary will be launched from 19 to 22 November 2020.

I'm sure Tasmaniab will get pregnant in cancer.
The Tasmania debilitant may have had cancer, but researchers have discovered a conflict that could lead to major changes in the treatment of patients.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells are comoflaged.
Researchers have found that the same process will take place in Tasmaniadeville and Hett.
This finding is expected to create a new way of treating cancer patients.
What's the common point with Tasmaniab and Het?
It's an invisible cancer cell.
The study team of Peter Macalam Cancer Center in Melbourne discovered a great possibility of a major change in the treatment of cancer if there is cancer that does not respond to the treatment.
There is also the possibility that you will have the key to a high-fashioned face-to-face attack that threatens the future of the Tasmania Debil.
In this study, one of the cancer cells in the liver and in the bag were not reacting to a comflagement using a single substance called PRC2 and prevented the immune system from attacking the cancer.
This will be a major problem for a type of skin cancer called mercene.
Professor Mark Dosson, a researcher for Peter McCalm, told AAP that "the most important thing in this project is that patients who are patient in the treatment of immunization may be able to reverse the process."
In order to re-use the next treatment, Marker, known as MHC, may re-activate the vaccine system so that the immune system can detect cancer cells.
"There is a possibility that smoking can have a great impact on the patients," said Professor Dosson.
"The lung is a disease that spreads around the world.
And maybe you can get better treatment in a better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used in the treatment of the face cancer of Tasmaniaa Devil, which is similar to the case where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's amazing that the same process occurs when it comes to the blood of Het and Tasmaniab."
"To date, it was very rare to treat Tasmaniab's cancer.
However, if a drug that has an effect on the liver can be used for tasmaniab, it may be possible to help control the liver. "
Scientists are also confused about the vast planets around the extremely small stars.
Scientists are surprised to discover the current solar system that surrounds the planet’s current understanding of the formation of the planets, which is called the Red Star, 30-year-old.
On September 26, 2019, the Great Gas Planet GJ3512b was released, a artistic image that revolves around the star, which is its master star.
It's usually larger than the largest planets around it.
But in this case, the size of stars and planets is not very large.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the sun's size, but the planets around it have at least half the largest star in our solar system.
"Yes, that's still surprising. "The study published in Science Science led this study, said the astronomers at the Catholic Institute of Sciences in Spain.
The theory of the design model is that the normal amount of stars are made up of tiny planets like the earth and the small ocean stars, and this discovery was surprising.
In this case we found a huge gas planet like the moon, around a very small star.
The star, which is made up of gas like the star, was discovered using the telescopes of the Coloralt constellations of Spain.
It's about 204 days around the planet.
The red star is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
GJ3512 is not just smaller than our sun, but it's about the size of the giant planets and almost the same size, and it's only about 35 percent larger than the star.
It's darker than the sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 degrees Kelvin (6380 degrees/3527 degrees W).
That's why you're wearing a red color.
One of the signs that the two planets are currently orbiting the planets is that three planets have the possibility of being released from its star system in the past, explains the orbital orbital orbit of the star, and Morales said.
The planets are made from the same spheres that produce the stars around them.
The most powerful model of the planet is called the "cococal collection" model, which comes from the solid cells inside the sphere, and the energy of the planet's orbits increases.
This special planet system could be described by using a resistance model called its own weightless, unstable model.
"If this is the case, the original planetary system that takes away the stars when they were born may have been smaller and less temperature than it was supposed to be."
Because this is a state of emergency, there's a possibility that some high-end areas will appear.
These particles are growing until they are destroyed, and they form planets.
Detective Dellie, let's eat a cup of freshly baked bread together.
The Marion Security Office, Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) has been told that they have eaten the fat diet that has been awakened.
In the woodlands of Olvani, Cassandra Ani Medina Hernández (38) was reportedly charged with the suspicion that methamphetamine is being transmitted and controlled to others.
The suspicion is due to an incident in the Grifft Wei food store in Jefferson on 9 September.
According to an estimate made by OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Delhi for a meal, and asked me to make some sense of what Medina Hernández was making.
According to the declaration, the victim told the agent that he hasn't done methanphetamine yet, "I thought after eating a few words, I thought it would make a difference, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman comes back to work, she's got a bad toothbrush on her feet.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, in the first local hospital where a woman went, it was determined that there was a possibility that methamphetamine was mixed.
According to Za Smocking Gang, another Sliftwei employee said that Mediana Hernández told the victim that he was "injecting drugs," and the police said that his three employees had sent the message that the suspect had taken Metanfetamine in the wrong direction.
According to an article in Oregon, a video taken from Delhi is written by a video that mediaina Hernández is playing in the back of the camera, taking something out of Brazil.
And then, you get up and put your nose on the side of the table, and you're put in a little piece of paper.
The police told me that everything they took out of Brazzar was on the roof.
According to the Oregon Stateman Journal, the security officer said that he doesn't think there's a food-producing client right now.
Mediana Hernández is held in Marion Prison instead of $50 million.
According to Za Smocking Gang, the long record of arrests in the Mediterranean Hernandes has been a crime of violence, theft, theft, theft, methamphetamine and the possession of weapons of mass destruction.

The hospital's "required" in the public hospital, where five medical doctors are involved in the administration of social services.
The hospital's public hospital, which was announced on 26 days to reorganize the labor department, was five times the size of the hospital.

The long-term urban hospital and the small urban hospital are developing a plan to build a new hospital in several cities in eastern and eastern Europe, and the Ivan Rissuprey Hospital has decided to move to the long-distance town of São Paulo.
The hospital is in charge of the center of the city, including Kea, which has continued in the years of the black word.
The President of the House of Commons stressed that "the city has been carried alone and has a way to connect with the hospital in nearby towns, and that the hospital must remain forever for the people," and he expressed a negative view of the reorganization and socialization.
The East Asian Hospital's office said "I don't hear any of the contents," and she stopped saying, "I'm going to take a good look at the regional medical planning conference and meet the interests of the debate."

The Song of the Mountains (from the age of 21) has continued to run the top of the student football field.
He led the team to victory in a group of high-ranking high-class groups.
And with the Japanese leadership in 2019, it has won the victory over the male Dublins, and the T.T. has decided to win the T.T. in the end of August.
For example: Dignix05, back: Dignix80.
I'm going to get rid of the camp and I'm going to get a larry fight in the back.
I used to use tennis, but I changed my labs when Dignics showed up, which made it possible to focus on ballholds during the game.
And this kind of love stuff in the mountains is a list band used in the experiment.
"There was a time when the back of the World Trade Center became a big deal. At the same time, when you put a list band, you felt that your hands were fixed and you were going to hit a compact, so when you tried, it seemed like you didn't have a lot of pressure on the top of the list band.

Mr. Edwards is dead by 9 a.m.
On the first floor of the joint party in Dipsaus, Jack Edwards, elected from the state of Alabama, who had retired for the first time, died on Friday.
Mr. Edward announced that he had died in his own home at the Fea Hops.
As the joint forces in Dipsaus grew, many of the parliamentarians in Alabama were elected to the federal parliament, but Mr. Edwards chose the first member of the House of Commons in 965 years.
Mr. Edwards appointed the President of the Federal Assembly "0.
According to a statement made by the tribe, Mr. Edwards recently asked what world he wanted to inherit from his generation and said that he wanted to return to the celebration.

I'm sorry about what happened to Harry last night.
This post is part of our special coverage of Human Rights.
It's done about half an hour before 27 a.m.
At the end of the report of the attack by the army's war helicopter on the ground in the city of Diaspora thousands of years ago, the Deputy Minister of Defence of the Mountain Defence, who was imprisoned for explaining and thanking for his crimes, had spent 26 nights in the innkeeper's kitchen, eating "a beautiful" on Twitter.
On 27 days after meeting with the knowledge, I removed the envelope.
"It's about half an hour after 26 a.m."
I also wrote a picture of the U.S. government's country officials and the local councillors who attended the dinner.
Mr. Mountain then added that he was wrong about "good luck" on Twitter.
After a 27-day interview with the riverese Defence Service, he said, "We'll see the tweets."
After a 27-day speech to three cities on the subject, Mr. Mountain, who responded to the press release, said, "If I had the impression that my message was wrong, it wouldn't have been my idea."
He emphasized that he had been deleted in his own judgement, and that the tweet was not appropriate.
One of the self-governing staff who was explained 27 days ago by Mr. Mountain, said, "I don't know what you're thinking.
The House was elected four times by the President of the House in the South East.
This month's internal reform was about the current job.
In an accident, two members of the crew who were carrying her were killed by the girl in the crash site.
Michelle Obama, in an internship program called Megan Markel "Instellition".
Michel Ovama, who appreciated Megan Markel's high regard for the morning of the wedding, called him "the kind of leader who's better than the world."
Mrs. Harley and his son Arthur Harrison Mount Batten=Winzer attended a ten-day formal visit to South Africa to the youth's reception this week, and they met with Obama's crew.
Mrs. President, "Thank you very much for breaking the old tradition and making the world better, and for my friend, Lord Sachsex @sexxroal, thank you very much."
Mrs. Obama took pictures of the Poss gang with the group and added that "even if she talks with the Obama Group, and supports girls in the world who are looking for appropriate education, many people are encouraged."
The girl of the "Sutt" was a meganist who interviewed Mrs. Obama in September with the guest editors of the British version of the magazine.
In that frank discussion, the President-in-Office of the Council took note of whether mother and mother had changed their lives.
In the interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Mother is like being in the upper class."
My work as a mother taught me that I would find myself wanting to be a child and make the right distance for me to grow up.
It's not the idea of a child as a parent, it's not the fate of his childhood, it's to find out who they are.
In the world, Mrs. Obama, who actually knew the posters that were plying the world, gave a little advice to the mayor on the video of Good Housing magazine.
"sometimes, the audiences of their own and those around them may feel very much."
So, I don't want to do anything quickly, but my biggest advice.
The first few months in the White House, as they started to work voluntarily, the girls began to live up to school and care for their new friends.

Washington (AP) - The Alcohol Management Committee in Washington, U.S.A., rejected the claim that Washington should refer to the wine sales licenses of the local transpinisional hotel because of his doubts about Orner's suitability.
The Committee, on Wednesday, three members of the House, two former judges and two Jewish leaders, complained of the plight of most claimants who did not have permanent assets in Washington, Washington, U.S.A.
According to Washington Post, this is the second time the claim that obtaining a license to sell wine is based on the state law that the applicant needs to "appropriate" and that it will be used to monitor the withdrawal of the right to supply alcohol to the hotel.
The first complaint made in the summer last year was that the President of Tranp's violent suspicions were repeated and that he was in contravention of the state law.
The claim was rejected because of the fact that the permit has already been accepted.
This is a two-fold complaint to update the license.
Benttrey is the first one to be picked up by the Miss Flying Bees!
And I'm going to say, "Well, I'm going to have to tell you what this is about.
In May 2019, in the club factory in Benttrey, England, the plant was started, and the harvest was first held in September.
The staff who worked in the club factory without losing weight were able to collect more than 100 bags of whiskey from one box.
How did Benttrey get to eat in the factory where she was building the clumsies?
That's what I want!
We're going to have to get Bentrey here. (11)
Peter Bosch, a member of the manufacturing department of Venture, comments as follows:
"In order to contribute to the biodiversity of the area, first of all, we set up the first box in the vast area of the club industry this year.
From the wildflowers that grow in the soil and from the mountains around them, the farmers have observed that the honeybees collect a variety of flowers.
It's a great idea that this place is suitable for food, and it's a good idea that there's a lot of savings in a year.
Bentrey's extensive activity to become a top of the Sustainable Automotive Mecker through the club industry and society, and it's part of the growth of honey.
I'm also very supportive of the staff.
It's a pleasure to have received the initial income in a free way, to set up more boxes in the coming year, and to increase the amount of the revenue of the Venture Hachimitz.
We're going to take a small step, but it's going to be safe for the biodiversity of the area.
In May 2019, we started 12,000-year-old "Friing Bees" food.
And in September of the same year, when we had a summer, we finished the work of extracting straw from the oven, and then we put it on a far-off plane, and we had a broken hammock.
You can also see the box and the package of hats and pentreams.
The design of the label, the designer of Bentley's intelligence, took care of Louise McCalm.
The bottled hammike will not only be shared with the staff but also be given to the important customers and guests who visit the club.
The United Kingdom is a country that is important to Time.
It's a very good fennelty, of course, compared to Hachmits, and it's like playing the Flying Bees in the afternoon.
The innocent Creebrand police report is the worst of England's reports.
The police who continued to do so were under pressure from the inspectors in England to make the impression that they were the worst.
The Creibland police have reported an inaccurate report and have been arrested in all areas.
The Creibrand police are continuing to "severely" and the police officer Phil Gomley says.
Five police officers have been serving in this police force for six years, and they are facing a new voice calling for a release.
According to the report, he stopped crime, arrested suspects, and tried to protect the weak.
Phil Gomley of the Police Officer said, "We've been doing a lot of damage since we last investigated."
Chief of Police, Mike Will, said, "The month has been abandoned for less than a year, but it's very serious about your actions," but it's been investigated by a number of non-public suspects.
Idrian Roberts, Vice-President, became a part of the detention process when he was arrested for some illegal conduct.
Simon Howard, a police officer, came out to the investigation committee because he had engaged in sexual behavior last year.
He turned the police down.
"This is because the police have officially proved the destruction of the police.
It's time for the interior ministry to intervene."
Richard, chief of the police, said, "I have a lot of responsibility for the progress of reform."
Nancy Perosi: William Bar has become a "Crime", and we need to make a final decision.
I don't know what's going on from here.
Now, we think we're dealing with something that's hidden and there's a chance there's a lot of time to investigate," and Mr. Peroshi spoke to the federal parliament about CNN's acquisition.
"I'm going to do what I've started to do, based on the time it takes to find the facts," said Mr. Perosi.
In a report published this week on the White House, it was found that Tranp relied on Ukraina's president, William Zelensky, to be elected president of the United States in 2020 and his son, former Vice President Joe Baiden.
According to the communication record, he also knew that he relied on Zerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal inquiry lawyer, Rudy Juliani.
Mr. Tramp has denied the wrong.
CNN, who was first aware of the internal announcement of the operation of the Ukraina in front of an official note a week ago, was a national security lawyer in the province of justice, and reported to the tree.
The Department of Justice, who was notified by information stakeholders, decided that Mr. Tranp's phone calls should be conducted in a political fund-raising investigation.
On Friday, on the question of whether Mr. Bur should testify, Mr. Peroshi decided who the Special Committee would ask for witnesses.
But Mr. Peroshi added that Mr. Bar had become a criminal.
Of course, it's been like this before.
"Because the last name of the bar was given," said Mr. Peroshi, and he was touched by the name of the President of Ukraine on the July call with the president of Ukraine.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to decide on the end of this complaint.
Mr. Perosi said about the internal prosecutor who became an informant that Mr. Tranp attacked the complainant on Thursday as a spy, and was most disappointed that the treatment of Spain had been different in the past."
I think President's statement is very irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Perosi said that the internal prosecutors have played an important role in the U.S. government's false disclosure and public involvement," and he said, "the fact that the president said that there is nothing in the government that would be extremely damaging."
Mr. Perosi, who has tried to force foreign heads for the fire and political interests, announced that he is going to take a formal stand against Tranp, and wrote a historic step.
The content of the conversation is contained in a statement published in the tree, in which the domestic prosecutor claims that Mr. Tranp used his right of office for the next presidential election in 2020.
In addition, the domestic prosecutor claimed that the White House intelligence attorneys had instructed the party to remove the contact records from the computer system of the high-level use of computers and to switch to a special-secret information system.
Christal, Ford of Paris, Christian Bentecke, a speedy obstacle to driving.
In two months, the Premier's star, Christian Bentek, who has been tested twice in the opposite direction, will receive a ban on driving.
The 28-year-old Ford of Crystal Paris, who drove his penthouse on 20th of May, admitted that he walked 50 miles at the A3 speed in western Richmond, London.
In March of the last year, the Belgians were filmed in the West Patony in London, where they were running faster than 40 miles of speed than 89 miles of speed.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Syria, does not have to be brought to the Court of Justice of Labender Hill this morning.
Even though the judge of the government, who was executed in the beginning of July, continued to give a simple answer to the charges of the crime, Benteke admitted that he was guilty of both of these violations.
9.2% of Taiwan's high school students have "experimental experience" and they're not going to go through it.
The National Health Agency of the Ministry of Health (UNHCR) jointly announced the results of a study on the sexual experience of high school students in Taiwan on 26 September.
So the students who answered that there was an experience are 9.2%.
It turned out that about five of these people had no abortions.
The survey was carried out in 2017 for students living in high-tech schools, high-tech schools, and high-tech schools.
In comparison with the results of the previous survey (15 years), the number of students with sexual experiences decreased slightly from 11.1%.
On the other hand, 22.6.6% of 15–17-year-olds and 22.6% of men and women have not been out of their lives in close sex, and 19.2% have gone up the previous time.
It's 28.8% (formerly 22.6%) and 16.2% (e.g. 14.5%) of women, and it's known that they're all becoming increasingly focused.
The agency suggests that young people today have a lot of opportunities to get information on the Internet, and that it's easy to get the wrong information.
They are calling for accurate knowledge to increase the risk of infection, not only the spread of osteoporosis but also the increased risk of infection.

Gana: Kofi Maun, the investigation committee is in the process.
Kofi Mani, a football manager and employee of the second-hand Hasakas, expresses his appreciation for the composition of the GFA's next panel of investigations.
When he questioned whether he was a member of the Frank Davis Committee, he expressed disappointment about it.
In his statement to GNAsports, the Commissioner said that the results of the investigation were of interest and that it was fair or questionable to include the President.
The Board of Auditors should be set up as a fair-minded member of the Committee of the Regions, whether it has no contact with the Committees or not.
For example, Mr. Davis made an appointment as a lawyer with the NC and wrote a letter to Mr. Osei Cook Parma about the award.
My partner is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, because he's in good spirits, the committee's duty should not be allowed, but Maun objected.
Mr. Maun, when Mr. Fred Papoe, of the Olympics, attended the Committee, said that his association with the Club would be counterproductive to the Committee's members, and that Mr. Parmar would show that there was prejudice and injustice against him.
The members of the Committee were scheduled to begin work on 19 September (the tree) just after the program started at the GFAa Aclar office, which was scheduled to end on 4 October.
The Committee is composed of Frank Davis, a member of the Corporalt Gabonans Consultant, and a lawyer, Marian Barnoa and Emmanuel Darkworth.
Another member of the Marquetting Department, Mr. Reginald Lareia, has a lawyer's lawyer, Richard Akpokavi, in sports.
It was found that 54 to 2% of small enterprises in the middle of the market think that "the lowest in the world" is "the lowest in the world" and that the goal of the country's minimum payout is "the highest in the world".
In 20"8 years, the number of companies that had been collected by nine companies was "ensured" and five percent of the new middle-aged companies were left behind by illegal companies, and the number of companies who suffered from human security increased by 3 percent.
The company, which responded to the call for thousands of hours, had more information links ("00%"), constructions (70-6%), and sales (6%").
There were more than half of the "controversial" sections of manufacturing (5.9%) and food and shelter services (60.9%) and transport was the same.
The participants in the conference are saying that "there is a high tendency to fight in many types of work that gives parties and time, but there are a lot of companies that think it's difficult to ensure that people are safe, and that's what they think about."
The company that responded to the "controversial" said that when it was possible to raise it, the average amount of money was 895 dollars.
"In March 9th, when I heard about the use of the company, the new use of the company was 6-3%, the average use was 54-5%, and the irregular use was "5.4% of the company.
I didn't pick up eight or six percent.
The number of companies that were able to secure is 44 to 7%, 50 to 3%, and the irregularity is 3%.
In particular, transport (3-3%, 37-5%) and construction (24%, 38%).
86-4% of the entire group had a problem with the use of it, and in many cases, "the number of respondents is a small number of "the low level of social knowledge " " cannot suggest a favourable condition with money."
As an administrative measure, there were many voices calling for the strengthening and provision of information for the new 2nd (after 3 years of retirement) and the medium-term use.
I had a desire to ask for a delay in the application for students, such as the provision of the PR for out-of-school students and the support of various interviews.
And as for the support and cooperation that the country has launched in its enlargement strategy, the answer is, "5 to 3% is already recognized."
I'm going to say, "I'm going to accept it in the future."
"I don't believe" was 64%, 82-8%, 73%, 72-7%.
The investigation took place on July 9th, 2 August, with thousands of companies.
298 (29-8%) received an answer.
From the beginning of the JR village on the streets of Taipei - Yahoo! News
The JR village line, which has been linked to the damage to the line since the beginning of the 27th day, was reopened from the beginning of the day.
The JR village line and the direct generation line, the long line, started at 27 a.m. and returned to normal operation.
The JR village is located in the middle of the riverbed and the river along the river, and the coast of the road is affected by the wind, and the terrain is flooded.
The number of JR cars in the long line has been reduced, and the gap in the picture has continued.
It's from the state-owned state-owned state-zeal company that the 26-day repair work is completed, and after a 27-day pilot's train has been run off, it's started again.
Tiprik, I'm going to make a decision before I'm done with pride.
"It's a place to see," said Justin Tiprik, who decided the course of the next tournament.
Well, if Wales wins Walabys, it'll be the hottest win in Paul D, and maybe it'll be sure that the best win for France or Argentina.
If Australia, which has fought 15 so far, has won the 14th battle against Wales, Tiprik and the team will be the best 8 front lines in England.
"Of course, both teams are trying to win over the group. "We want to win."
The war against (Australia) has already had serious consequences, but it has been a great success in the past year.
I think Australia's going to blame me for returning the loan, but I'm still trying to win it again.
Before I came here, I knew this experiment was a mountain.
And I'm here. It's a real sight.
Wells is only one victory for Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in the World Cup so far, but the win for Warabys is the third round of 32 years ago.
And under Wallen Gateland's supervision, the total score for the three teams in the Southern Hemisphere is seven in the 41st battle.
Wells stopped the 13th anniversary of the Australian test match last November, but Tiprik was one of the players playing in Tokyo's 9-6 matches this week.
He asked if he didn't feel better before he won, and Tiprik said, "It's hard to answer.
I've really tried, and I've been thinking that we're all going to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I've actually made 15 points at the end of the test, and I've actually seen it as a lot more expensive."
To win, Welz, the Australian Conbies, Michael Forper, and David Pocock, and the Typrik's blackdown battalion.
Typrik, who has been experienced in the 67 International Assembly of Tests, has been aware of what has been done with both previous attempts and what is expected.
He says, "They're probably the world's back players."
When we fight the world's backlore, we'll always know that we're going to have a hard time.
The two continue to be the world's highest level.
That's why you know what you're going to do.
Pocock is one of the world's backers in a protective way, and Michael's only attackable but it may mean that he's going to the right place when he needs it.
I want to raise myself up against the world's greatest player rather than fight the weak and powerful bakloe.
I want to fight my best friend, and if we fight the two of them, we have to make a deal.
This Sunday doesn't mean winning the level, but it's a big test for us in the World Cup.
It's a big deal.
If you continue to raise your hands, you will be able to make sure that you do not lose your foot.

The meeting of the Government's small committee to discuss the treatment of water treatment of the original origin of the Tokyo Electric Forest, which was held at Tokyo's port area in 27 a.m.
At the 27-day small government committees to examine the treatment of the water supply that continues to grow in the island, Tokyo's electricity has indicated the equipment and specific arrangements that are expected to be used as a method of decommissioning the oceans and inland waterways.
In view of the harmful effects of radiation tritium, it is determined by the amount of the material, and it is determined that it will stop immediately until it is released.

East Enders, nettabare: Ben's kisses in the column after Whitney's bomb news.
In the East Enders, Kalam Haywei (Toney Cray) was so excited about the sudden explosion of the Whitney Dean (Siona McGarty) that he was able to get back to his loved ones before the heat of Kalam and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowen).
But does love begin with two people, or will it be a time to regret this hot moment?
And since he helped Ben and Bobby Bill, who was in difficulty, have been able to get closer to two people, and he's recently become weak, and he's been glad to see you in a nice place, and he's probably gonna be able to make some dates.
Tonight, Whitney's gonna be better off and better off.
It is clear that she was very effective in leaving Walford after discovering that the person who was supposed to be a sad wedding and a flower.
When Whitney came home, he was going to have a conversation with Calam.
But not yet, Whitney knew the new fact, and he hit the column, and he'd be happy.
The column is moving, and Jay Mitchell (Jamey Boswick) is worried about the column that's on Queen Vic's.
And the slender karma went into Ben's side, and all the things that happened, and he blames Ben.
Ben keeps his anger calm and gives me a word of comfort, and then two people get a kiss.
But what do two people do with this?
Two people tried to date the next week, but Ben gave us some material to think about, and we did it together.
However, a new confidence in Gaius' father is determined to fight for what he wants and what is right.

If Gibbin's business has a "9th" in the garage, how long will it be for him to share it with his neighbors?
In one of the issues of the Gibing Entrepreneurships, which has made it possible for anti-social employment to be achieved, the problem of Ghana is also being addressed.
When the President of the House met on 22 July, he said, "The company had nine talents, and there's nothing like that," and he said, "5 to 6:4."
If you have 9 percent gibbin on the "9:1" ratio, you've got 9 percent gibbins, it's supposed to have contributed to Gibbin, and the investor's view that tax is taxable, and you're tweeted over 30,000 times.
If there's a "9:1" in the garage, there's a lot of taxes and taxes.
I've heard from the tax administrators for the rest of my life.
● Neither is the legal person responsible for paying taxes.
I'm going to ask you a question about the division of the gallery.
It's not a personal interest, it's not a tax, it's not a personal interest.
If there's a share of $9.1 million in the work, Jibin's interest is going to be around $1 million, and it's going to be worth $9 million.
This is a legal tax.
Of course, this is a tax declaration, and it's already recognized by the law.
And even though you were wondering about sharing, you're not suggesting that the actual amount of money is not really the same as the amount that you're supposed to have.
And I think you're selling your money.
If you don't know what you're doing, you're going to say, "Oh, I'm going to do it, I'm going to say, "I'm going to do it."
It's a problem when you trade a price (e.g. sale of non-smokers) for the purpose of avoiding tax returns.
But, like this time, the third party will not be able to decide how much the taxable price is appropriate for what both parties have negotiated without arguing.
I think it's a personal offense to have a paycheck.

White House, a big panic.
The White House Association has become increasingly aware of the pressures of the new Democratic Party on wood, and it has been explained that this week there is a "big panic" about the new reality.
The people near the White House said that there is an increase in the scope of the West Bank, and the demand for internal prosecutors to give the president and a lot of people who are around.
He said, "I don't have a real person."
The White House Association has not had a clear plan for this situation, but the usual approach to the President's understanding of the proposal so far has not been applicable, so this claim is very serious, until there is no certainty of how to proceed, and it seems that the next reported news is not going to be eliminated."
Another person who is aware of this debate, as this poll continues, expressed the expectation that the president would return the regular track and "not be able to do it" to raise the expectations of the attacker in the White House, who raised the warning.
Other information on the bombing investigation tells us that President Precises are looking forward to the day, and that the president's presence is near the president's side, which is going to be more "professional" than ever before.
Tranp is no longer an unexploded act, and it's taking a car to remember the potential of an unexpected attack, and it's becoming a concern for the president and the political environment of the election year.
Tranp faced the greatest threat during the presidential term, and has turned his hand into an attack and a defense, so that he can revive his own strategy in the Russian investigation of Robert Molar.
Tramp tried to look at the position of the President of Ukraine, who wanted to assist in the investigation of the political enemies, and he was interested in the activities of President George Biden, and tried to undermine the confidence of the internal prosecutors as a party fighting forces.
But many of the White Houses have been tested by the Molars, and they're starting to feel different this time.
The president, who was the leader of the force, was Brand, but he seemed to be looking at a meeting of the water reporters, and some people were talking about the situation.
It seems that the Tranp was not in the mood to answer the questions about Russia's investigation.
There are people who argue that there was no direct contact with President Tranp and Vorojimil Zelensky, who are in dispute, and there are people who are aware of the fact that they had no direct contact with the President of Ukraine, and there are people who claim that it is a fact that the internal complainant's credibility is damaged, and there are close to the presidents who are convinced that the Dámémé can be reduced.
Moreover, it is a good thing that Presidents are attacked, but there is an increase in the level of support to protect them from the fact that they are.
But the joint strategists who are near the White House point out that the president's basic level of support is already very high and will not have the effect of getting new supporters from the bomb.
In particular, if the bombing is to prevent the legislative issue and make the news unique in four hours, "there's no advantage in the first four months of the presidential bombing".
Another source says that those who claim that the bomb will help the president are not fully aware of how uncertain the President's response will be.
Remember, the White House is asking for advice on how to build a team against the bomb.
According to the stakeholders who explained the bones of this project, this approach is still a preliminary stage, but it is not yet clear whether a process like a strategic decision-making room will be implemented or how it will be implemented.
However, there is a recognition that organized legal strategies and communication strategies, as well as a critical internal advertising document and its publicity, are needed to combat the efforts of the democratic parties to organize the campaign with a view to combating the threat of proliferation.
According to this situation, the fact that President Mike Ponpeo and President Steven Muwishin said that they did not publish a memo about the President of Tranp's Ukraina, who said that it would not be published 48 hours later, clearly shows a lack of a long-term strategic perspective.
From the time of Robert Molar's investigation, which is almost unspoken, the audience is now looking forward to a higher audience. According to the people involved, there are people who can be involved in the action against the bomb, called the external pipeline of the tramp, and Corry Luwandowski, who is the prime minister of the election.
But it's not true that Luwandouski would show himself to be the leader of such an organization, but he told the NBC news.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and the politicians, but I have not spoken with the president and the neighbor about participating in a team against this lying accusation."
I'm also involved in the treatment of the bomb by the external attorney Jay Secrow of the tramp during the Molar investigation.
And to the NBC news, the secrow said, "The problem is going to be handled properly."
The Emmet Flad, who led the White House to the end of the visit to the Crinkton Bridge, has left behind the experience of Pat Sipolon, now called the White House Legal Investigation, and now there are not enough lawyers who have had the experience of the bombing problem.
The information on the White House strategy is generally recognized as being the most remote in the structure of a team of human recruitment and strategic strategies, but it is organized, and it is necessary for all to respond to the efforts and the political struggle.

● Couples who get married from far away
You've been dating him for a year and a half and you've been in love with him.
And there's a saying, "You're going to be tested away, and you're going to be stronger."
Professor of Forest Friendship (under the river) is known as Denatravell's Anckett's research (in August 2017, 1147 respondents) but according to data, 16% of the total number of couples who were married to distant love were married to each other.
Because love is used to five senses, it's already connected to seeing each other, listening to the voice, holding hands, waving the tongue, and pushing the kisses.
But if you're far away from love, most of the cases are heard by phone.
It's a difficult possibility to continue to be involved in hearing alone.

Devin Winnese, a democratic party who asked for the "Tramp" film.
Mr. Devin Nance (California Joint Party) seems unable to bear the idea that President Donald Tranp will be investigated.
On Monday, in a comment to protect the president, the President's country's country photo has condemned the democracies who tried to enter.
Member of the Special Committee for the Post Office of the Special Committee for Information claimed in the opening statement of the Court of Justice that Tranp relied on the presidential successor, Joe Biiden, and his son to investigate the investigation.
The co-chairman said that Ukrainian suspects and the "Grotechnic show" created by the left party and the president's democracies who wanted to see the whole picture.
"That's exactly what the Democratic Party of this Special Committee has spoken to people who think they're Ukrainians in order to get a photo of the tape. "
Of course, it is true that the democratic party is so excited to attack this president that it has a chance within a year and that everyone is asking.
At the end of the post office, Mr. Jennifer Bendley's senior political assistant in Hafpopost was surprised to see that the Democratic Party's members are trying to find the truth.
The answer has already been answered only by Vice-President Jim Hims of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but for many other parties, there is no doubt that the answer is extremely true.

Origami, Wallet and real cards.
Press Watch - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet also pays for Origami Pay, as well as the possible way out of money and financial institutions.
It's also the function of the Chargé d'affaires.
They also start financial services, such as finance, investment, insurance.
I mean, you can use the financial functions you need to pay, move, charge, borrow, steal, prepare, or use the Origami Wallet.
Origami Financial Services, the representative of the company, said that Mr. Woody Snow had to live in a variety of financial problems, such as money, and that he had to solve the problems of the young generation, and create a new financial service, for example, "for example, those who were far away from the financial system, who wanted to help equalize those who had not yet received the benefits."
Origami Wallet's advantage is that if you have an Origami ID, you'll get information on the timer when you're done with your application until you're done with the deal.
I also explained that, not only the Origami app, but also that it is possible to use the Origami app if you don't have Origami app.
In the case of financing, it shows the ability to connect and pay back when making decisions.
And even if there's another urgent need for funds, I'm going to finish with Origami's application from the request.
As regards insurance, it represents the first life of a party company, the news and damage.
I told the two companies that they had data and knowledge and that they were planning to reveal the security goods that they were carrying on their lives.
The provision of financial services is to begin and increase in order to meet the necessary administrative requirements.
■ "Origami Technologies" for the effective use of data.
Origami announced on the same day that companies will digitalise their clients' access points from Origami's decision-making function, and that they will also set up a new program "Origami Technologies" that supports the effective use of data, including the data stored by the company.
As for Origami Network partner companies that report on Origami and decision-making, Origami is recognized as a problem with the effective use of data, such as how it is manufactured and how it is manufactured, and how it is designed for real society, such as data collection, processing and analysis.
In this context, the Origami Technologies, which supports decision-making data from their company Pay, support the acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, as well as the structured data provided by the reporting company.
The effective use of data is contributing to the progress of the new business model creation (Directal Transformation) that uses digital technology and data.
Origami, the representative of the company, said, "Many companies are now collecting data and making customer contacts," and the key is, "In the next phase, how we're going to display business models using data."
"I want to create the next phase innovation with the data built on the Origami Network, which includes many business data."
The details of the specific service content will be published on a regular basis.
In addition, in the Origami Conference 2019, Origami's future organization, such as the rain, would bring a coupon to Smaho, which would provide an efficient and efficient technology.
And yet, the Origami Pay is still making all the adjustments, but it is being clarified as a system for the use of the rules.
In addition, it has been suggested that, in cooperation with the regional activation of the vision society, we should be able to act as a support.

He said, "If there's any activity we can do to extend the meeting at least."
After the funeral, a message was presented by the Korean Association of Art Exchanges of Korea, which was sent by the head of the Institute of Health at the end of Chuchu International Studies.
Renewable potential for CO2 emissions in biofuel studies.
In recent years, electric cars and tesra trucks, not only because they own the news, but also because they don't get the power of renewable energy.
However, Alberta University professor has developed a technology that can be used as a jet fuel for renewables.
Dr. David Brassler, professor at the Ministry of the Environment of Alberta Agricultural Studies, started this project in 2003.
The professor's study room is developing carbon dioxide fuel from such substances as esteran, genome-rendaling, and canola oil.
This technique differs from that of ethanol and other biofuels, which can be used for production of low-quality oils, which are less than 85% of carbon emissions than oil-based fuels, and can use other industrial wastes in the production process.
This technique will also affect the renewal of carbon monoxide existing in oil-based fuels.
Dr. Brassler said, "This technique was achieved in the first century (in fact, it was actually produced) by the germs of the Dizelgasolin."
What will become a new choice for biofuel use, the next bio fuel technology is a tendency to slow down and unstable down and cause serious problems for high-level aircraft.
"The problem of jet fuel is, it's like, it's never going to happen," said Dr. Brassler.
There's no value as much as diesel, but there's a higher requirement.
In Dr. Brassler's studio, the jet is now looking at two choices as biofuels.
One thing is that in low-risk applications, we need to treat the carbon dioxide biofuels and add the water to them.
The second option is to continue to study chemical reactions that have already been developed partially, even under heat.
Dr. Brassler said about the second option, "You can also try the atomic clocks to change chemical reactions a little bit."
This option is very risky.
While airlines, Canadians and U.S. Army are increasing investment in possible options for recovery, the Albert University's children's Forge Hydrocorbons are involved in production.
"They're predicting if someone will ever pay the sugar tax in the future."
I want you to prepare for the worst case.
At present, Forge has worked near Edmonton's waste management center, and recently, $25 million was built to support production facilities in Sonbara, Ontario.
The factory is scheduled to produce about 1 19 million litres of biofuel per year.
Dr. Brassler says that the amount of carbon dioxide is 85%, but that there is no reason for any side effects such as fuel transport and production methods.
Mr. Brassler says, "Technical House."
My job is to make an option so that I can make a few decisions and make a number of choices.

[Exhibited in 2020] The North Sea Public High School is trying to stop the book's sex series (Lissemam) - Yahoo! News
On 26 September 2019, the Committee on the North Sea Education published a guide for the selection of high school students (orders and 2 years).
I'm dealing with the experience of transsenders who don't agree with their heart and body, and I'm going to cut off the other column from the way in which I want to study.
_Other Organiser
A guide to the selection of students from a traditional high-school school has been made available to students on a selection date, a collection of candidates, a candidate, a candidate, a change of wishes, a student examination, a certificate of performance, and reference data.
The general selection of students, the promotion of students, the selection of students and the selection of students from high school students who conduct high-level education in the public sector, and the selection of students from abroad.
Until the 2019 election of students, they had set up a different set of sex classes in the classroom, but because of the need for proper attention to the diversity of individual sexual orientation and identity, the 2020 election of students removes the "sexual" column from the way in which they are enrolled.
In general, academic studies of the choice of students are: language, mathematics, social sciences, and 5 schools in English.
The English hearing test is included in the English investigation period.
We've got 50 minutes to study each lesson.
In this case, the time required to answer is 45 minutes each time, and the time required for the investigation to begin immediately after the investigation time, and the time required for the compilation of the problem papers is 5 minutes.
The score is 60 degrees per class.
The election of high school students in the North Sea in 2020 is scheduled to be held from 21 to 24 January 2020 on the morning of the general election, from 29 January to 4 February, from 4 March to 4 March, from 4 March to 10 March, and from 10 March to 10 March, and from 4 to 24 March, from 4 to 24 March and from 4 p.m. to 27 March.
The choice of promotion and transport will take place on Monday, 21 January 2020, 24 January 2020, and on 13 February, as appropriate, by 20 February, and the re-adjustment of those who were not eligible for admission from the student's choice will take place from 21 February to 26 February.
Boris Johnson warned that if the Bridget was covered, the British would face an attack like Russell, and the Prime Minister would call for peace.
When two national votes have been won over once, there is a danger of "national violence" in this country, and the senior minister said last night.
The Prime Minister's senior officials warned that England would be faced with the violence of the Golden Best Movement in France with economic inequality and the mass of citizens of the 992-year-old Losanzells.
Mr. Johnson said that we need to stop using the word "winning" to "the political words spoken in a strong debate."
In spite of the fact that the Prime Minister had asked him to return the silence, one of them said to the Times: "There has never been such things as Jille Joon (Gold Best Movement) and Lasanzel's 992. "
I don't think there's any violence in this country because it's not yet happening.
They already have a view of the Golden Best Movement that they have encrypted and demoted their cell phones, and then they have a number of populist leaders who use dirty hands to beat people.
In Los Angeles in '992, a black taxi driver, Rodney King, was attacked by four white police officers who had beaten up King.
In this year, the anti-government demolition of France's gold-best, which attracted people's eyes, has been causing confusion and destruction in the city of Paris for over six weeks.
It pointed out that if the British failed to remove the EU, he said, "Our country's political system's trust would be destroyed."
"When 3 million people vote on national votes and 66% vote on those who remain in the EU, millions of people are disappointed."
And even though 99 percent of the authorities are opposed to leaving, they're very angry about how many million people don't want to write letters to the House of Commons.
It won't be that long until thousands of people get out of the way.
One senior minister added that if two national votes were to be won once, there would be a danger of "national violence" in the country.
Mr. Johnson is making a selection and requesting that the decision of the Bridgets be given to the authorities.
Mr. Johnson is reported to be faced with a rebellion in the basement, which, instead, calls for EU withdrawal.

A lot of time will be spent up to the end of the sentence, and the killers who were told there will be protected, and women's rights experts will remember the incident very little.
"It's too late for people to forget," said Falzana, founder of the first gendarmerie at the University of Pakistan, adding that even in the event of a baroque gathering, it's been easier than three years to solve.
It's hard to prove the high data that the human rights community has found at least 300 "nameless killers" in Pakistan for at least 20-8 years.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of known killers is more than that, because it assumes that about one in five percent of the number of victims in the world is Pakistan.

It's possible to raise the risk of heart disease and heart failure.
In recent studies, it is shown that there is a higher risk of heart disease than in the agricultural environment.
This is the result of a survey of the American group of people living in Hawaii over 30 years ago.
In comparison with a group of men who did not work around the farm, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart failure increased by 45 percent.
"This study emphasizes the importance of using personal protective equipment when exposed to agricultural drugs, reporting on the presence of agricultural explosives at work, and addressing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodrígues, a researcher.
Dr. Rodrigues is a professor of high school medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of a study of data collected from more than 6,000 men living on the island of Oaf.
Because this study applies only to men in the day, it may not be possible to apply to women and others, and researchers say.
The effects on health are likely to occur after a few years of exposure, because of the longer half-life of agriculture.
In this study, the biggest impact was seen within the next 0 years.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up study, there is no significant link between exposure to agricultural drugs and heart disease and heart disease," said Dr. Rodrigues in a report.
This is probably because other factors related to hypertension are more important than the possible relationship between agriculture and heart disease in the evening.
Researchers have found that there is no important link between exposure to low-medium drugs and heart disease and heart failure.
I'm going to talk to the Zerenskitrap phone, and I'm going to get a polosenko.
It was a terrible week about Washington's political issue, which was followed by the bombing of President Donald Tranpmi.
I wanted to avoid getting into a political scandal for Vorojimil Zerensky, a politician.
But on the phone issue of Zelenskytranp, what's the point of this, and what does Zelenski have to do with this?
First and foremost, Tranp tells Zerensky that the United States is more profitable than any other country in the EU.
The interview records published by the White House are described in detail, and it is described in detail that Tranp has been critically qualified to speak more specifically than the specific proposals of Prime Minister Angela Melkel and other heads of the European state.
The answer to Zerensky's response to a 100 percent or 1000 percent of the bomb is the subject of the debate.
Zelensky added that President McClonn and Michael do not have enough support for Ukraine.
The conversation was under way, and politicians, particularly Ukraine's rural parties, argued on social media.
President Pedro Poroshenko wrote on Twitter that "there is no example of EU support."
Moreover, Poroshenko tweeted that he is grateful for the support of the EU's Russian sanctions and economic assistance in Russia's "Russian aggression".
Ukraine's politicians, Victoria Vaitiska, say, "Can we ever communicate with Germany and France once more," and there are other politicians who show their gratitude.
The continued tramp is very much for military assistance, depending on Zerensky, "no more than two investigations, one of which is about Joe Bieden's son Hunter, and the other one shows that Ukraine was involved in the wrong interference of the Democratic Party's E-mail server in 2016.
It's not clear whether this is a barrier to European relations, whether it's against France or the German capital.
I don't want to say bad things about anyone.
Thanks to the people who support us, as soon as the communication records have been published," Zelensky said at the New York National Assembly.
Zelensky is scheduled to meet with the head of the head of France, Russia, Germany, at the Normandy 4 summit scheduled in October.

According to the White House statement, President Donald Tramp of the United States of America has appointed Peter Ghent to the United States Emergency Management Officer.
The Vice-President of FEMA, Mr. Geinno, was in the position of the President to oversee the disaster in Harikan and in the mountains.
Since the resignation of former President Block Long, the former president has been in a state of disreputable condition since his resignation in March.
The FEMA State Security Department, which is the top organisation of the FEMA, determined that Mr. Long had abused public service cars in Washington and North Carolina, where he lived.
Mr. Jeffrey Baiard, who was also promoted by another person, raised doubts about his involvement in alcohol abuse as a result of his own investigation, and was expelled from the trial at the beginning of this month's election.
Mr. Geenno's appointment was expected.
In the future, most of the office will need recognition.
Before he was appointed Vice-President of FEMA in 2018, Mr. Geinno was in charge of the emergency administration in Lodde Island, and he was a Marine Army soldier, said White House.
CBSlorosanzells - Police have closed the illegal Malifana Beiping plant in San Gabriel Barley.
The police shut down the illegal Malifana Beiping of San Gabriel Barley.
The police started to use the order at 4:37 p.m. after suspected trafficking in the illegal marifana pen, and a large container of Butanhany Oil was found at the office in Telster, about 900 blocks.
The Elmonte police officer Christopher Kano said that the agent also found equipment to support the Beepcardi.
"This project is very dangerous," said the Constable.
The Kano police department had previously been conducting drug investigation and said there was a possibility of fire in the process of extracting oil used for beep products.
"It's possible to fire only the silent electricity from your clothes, and it's not just a fire that can cause explosions."
Also, if there were such a number of containers, there was not only a fire and a chance that the whole of the building would be blown away.
The risk management team was called to the empty office and arrested the materials that were unlawfully dangerous.
The price of the goods and the bulk of the equipment acquired was not immediately published.
I got some anonymous information, and it was in order to find illegal activities at the scene, and the agent said.
Agents are looking for someone who's not a lawyer's shadow.
The police said that because the office was empty, the owner thought he was setting up a store in the office.
In the course of the investigation, the police said that they wanted to receive the latest news about the dangers of Beijping, and that the illegal beiping products would not be released again.
The police officer of Cano said, "It's a real thing that people don't even know."
It's also possible that the products are mixed with other harmful substances.
It may harm our communities and our children, so the police are constantly warning people not to get close to this activity.
There are six major earthquakes in the middle of the concert!
Hiding training at Hole City Hall (NewsUMK) - Yahoo! News
I thought the last earthquake in the concert was happening, and I was trained to avoid practice in the city hall.
This training is being carried out every year.
At the stage, there's actually a fire-fighting group playing, and it's supposed to be a six-strong earthquake in the direction of the song.
On 27 days of training, about 300 people, including young farmers, locals, and staff in the Hall, attended.
They are having fun playing, and they're playing.
(Whispers in the hall)
"It's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, and it's going to happen.

Elizabeth's missing address showed up at the Hampton Court Hall.
It was made up of high-level comets of silver, and it was covered with plants, flowers, and beautiful flowers.
I'm sure you're a part of the Hestrick Royal Palace address.
When Mr. Lin saw it, one of the ruins of the small church in the province was set up there 100 years ago, and it appears to be part of the remains of Elizabeth's remains of the world's wildlife dance.
Since Mr. Lin found this famous book that was used as a sacrifice to the church at Helfordshire, three years later, Elizabeth's missing address is expected to be shown near the very close room of the House of Hamptoncourt, which was used by the Queen of Chad more than 450 years ago.
"The remains of the 6th century's dress were only one more piece, and it is known that it was an important discovery in all of the Royal Woods Collections.
There's no complete evidence that Elizabeth gave her hair back to her dress, and she's been convinced that she's not missing from the royal property over the course of three years.
The highly valued organ "Bu" that used the silver coin was prepared in the royal room only for high-level members, but it shows that the former owner was a great man.
And when that dress was made, it seemed to be a price equal to a quarter of a wheat stalk.
And in the late 1590s of Elizabeth, the queen was threatened by other women in the temple.
Mr. Lin said it's important to make a statement, and I've come to see my partner's experts.
I'm sure they're always very happy to see the bomb, but they're always very happy, and they're looking at one of the Royal Streets.
One of the long seconds of the street used as a sacrifice to the Church of St.
Bacton is reported to have been involved in the long life of Queen Elizabeth's daughter in the village of Bransh Parry, who served as a female.
Dres is what Paris died in 1590, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, she would have moved into Paris's family or church.
More than 1,000 hours of restoration, of which 400 hours were spent on a very small hand with a special silk and short surgery, one of the most famous modern paintings in the show's time, described by Elizabeth, who used a similar dress.
The only wide space that can get some of the very expensive topest street is the rooms that have been modified in the Hamptoncot land, and the storage work is here almost here, and Libby Thompson, who is leading the work, says, "I feel truly respected for the professional skills of the person who created it."
And when you see a piece of clay on the table, it's a very great respect for the person who created it.
I haven't seen any of these refined works before.
Elizabeth's missing clothes show will be held at the Hamptoncourt Hall from October 12.

The police and fires continue to search from 6:00 a.m. to 29 p.m.

Mexico's drug cartels are involved in one third of the U.S. domestic drugs.
Immediately after the day of Chicago Westside, CBSNews seized the drug dealer.
Brian McNaut of the DEA explains what's going on with the White Houses.
In Chicago last year, almost 800 people died of drug abuse.
McNaut said that some 9 percent of the drugs that were taken in Chicago were imported from Mexico.
DEA is referring to the Mexican drug king, who is commonly known as El Mencho, Nemesio Selvantes.
"Mencho says, DEA is, in fact, the first person in the U.S. law enforcement agency in Mexico."
The amount of money spent on El Mencho will be $10,000.
With the help of Donahu, a number of ten drug production points in Milin were destroyed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harisco Nueva Nerasion (CJNG) is involved in at least three minutes of drugs imported into the United States on land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has sold "a large amount of cocaine, methamine, fentanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's head is paid $1 million.
In the flesh, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but he was arrested for his drug habit and sent to Mexico.
There's a violent drug cartel.
There's a huge amount of weapons, a driver's rocket, a 50-pound gun.
Donahu said that he owns his own special team.
El Mencho is protecting his empire without being punished without punishment from the attack of six Mexican military helicopters.
In recent years, thousands of deaths have been caused by the fight against drug cartels.
According to Mexico's government statistics, about 94 murders occur in one day.
In Chicago, in order to strengthen the drug of Mexico, it is necessary to use protective equipment when dealing with drugs.
On the basis of the production, the cocaine bags are printed by the seller's stamps.
It looks like El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahu said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that actually capture the lives of innocent women and children."
I mean, when someone's child died, it's a "high chance" drug from El Mencho's organization, and Donahu said.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of rape.

If the Rast of As Rimstad is interested in the future, Sony has already published a number of versions of the game, including the 12-inching version of man-made man carjacker, Ellie's backpack, and Breslett's Replica.
We're going to be able to move on the island, and we're going to try to keep the people in the North American press.
In the last 26 days of the Entrepreneurship, which has been reduced in the last seven cities, the movement began through the "Agreement of the Entrepreneurship of the Landing Council".
"By February, a wagon loaded with food supplies, snacks, and a van had to go back to the first day to the city and the semi-citizens.
There's an urgent supply of goods that goes beyond the expected sale, and there's a voice from the population that keeps asking for "the "choice" to help.
"0 points have been added to the van, like food, city-specific bags and laundry."
As you can eat at the age of one, you'll have to eat a little pasta salad in the pack, and you'll see what you're looking at with a handy price.
There's a lot of people in the city who can't afford to sell rice and sugar.
The President of the Council expressed his surprise that "I didn't think I'd be able to sell it like this."
In general, Mr. Maesun, who bought things in his husband's drive, said, "The price is easy and easy.
The user was also quoted as saying, "I don't want to drink coffee, but I want to drink coffee myself."
The Council will examine what is expected of us.
In the Isle of Entrepreneur, there is now only a conbini store, and the council has tried to sell the movement to save the "suppliers".
"Before February, 20 meetings in the island will be held on the moon, and you will see if you can continue as an event for the next year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison indicated that he had decided to increase the amount of $10,000 to the affected population.
The financial support policy for farmers affected by drought is extended and is widely viewed as a means of facilitating existing farmers.
In addition, some $34 million is planned for the victim's support facility, and the target farmers are expected to receive at least $3,000 emergency assistance.
As a programme to assist affected areas, the maximum 13 self-governing bodies will be helped to cover $1 million in order to prepare and combat the damage.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already calculated more than $70 billion as a bribe.
Ronald Rey Haskell: his wife's murder in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted of killing four of his five children in 2014 in Spring, Texas.
Haskell entered his house on 9 July 2014 and questioned the location of his wife, Melanie Haskell, who was away from home on 9 July 2014.
Mrs. Melanie wasn't there, but she had a sister, Katie Stey, and her family.
Haskell was born, and Mr. Stephen Stey (39), Katie Stey (33), 13 years old and 4 years old, 9 and 7 years old, and the Harris Police Department announced.
Only one member of the family, who was 15 years old at the time, saved his life.
At that time, the authorities reported that Mr. Cassidy was seriously injured, but then completely recovered.
Woodman, the prosecutors have all rejected the claim of innocence by the loss of the soul of Ronald Lee Haskell.
The jury was dismissed until the end of the month's term.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive us."
A girl's complaint that angered her would have affected the leaders of the country in which she lived.

At a National Climate Action Summit opened in New York, six-year-old Greta Tohnberi of Sweden asked for further action.
I'm going to take my education and sit in front of the council, and I'm going to make it a fire that spreads into the world the school street.
Young people who were under a lot of stress have been engaging in protests around the world, including Japan.
"There are about 4 million people in over 50 countries.
I've been on my way to get a little bit of a message board.
The threat of climate change is approaching.
The International Paris Agreement, which began in 2020, aims to reduce the global greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century and to reduce the temperature twice before the industrial revolution, if possible."
In the future, all the countries that are involved in each other's actions are not different from those of the countries that are on the move.
But the unusual climates, such as high temperatures and rain, are all around the world.
In the fast pace, we're going to need a process-increasing.
At a summit called by the U.S. President of the Government to strengthen the crisis, 77 Canadians have expressed their long-term goals for zeroing to 50 years.
The next 70 countries have set up the target.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which was excluded from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not reveal the new goal, and the withdrawal of the flag of the major countries became an integral part of the movement.
The criticism of Japan, which keeps oil power power, is strong.
In the long-term government strategy, only half of the century can produce early exits, but the gap between countries that see 50 years of zero is huge.
I didn't have a chance to talk to Japan at the summit.
A small step-by-step environmental environment that revealed Japan's approach to environmental relations, he said, when he saw the climate change problem, he said, "I'd like to talk about sex."
I don't deny the appeal, but I'm so weak than girls' complaints.
We're not going to react to the greta, who has become a symbol of environmental movement.
It's not a debate, it's not just a "replacement of the argument" that you're arguing about.
There is no guarantee of warming, and the international community must respond to the crisis of human society.
I don't want enough effectiveness to be involved in national negotiations.
There's a lot of young people behind Mr. Greta.
We should act as adults so as not to take that future away.
There's another way to get online.
As a result of the U.S. Army's research, the Internet has become a reality.
Such a network may have been unable to connect to the next network in order to provide military security, schedules and time functions.
According to the Department of Field Research, the Department of Military Capacity Development of the U.S. Department of Military Development, researchers from the University of Insbruck have achieved a record of material and light-quantified transfer - 50 kilometres of light-fibre cables.
It's related to antaglmentus, which is made up of quantified particles.
Two-digits are in antagral state, and if a measurement is performed on the side, and even if the ratios of the side are in a physical distance, the results of the measurement on the other side will be affected by the other side.
"This distance [50km] is more than two times the actual distance to begin the construction of the city’s mass network than it was in the past," says Dr. Ben Ranion, a leading researcher at the University of Insbruck.
The city's city-wide network is built on a network of physical, physical, even if there is a large distance.
The dispersion of this entangling point is absolutely essential for the creation of a mass Internet, says researchers.
"This evidence is a major step towards achieving large-scale dispersal tangrams," says Dr. Sarah Gamble, a deputy on the ground program that supports the study.
Also, the entangling elements in the export that passed the file also hold enough quality to meet the requirements of some of the most difficult networks.
The research team started experimenting with the calcium atom that was caught in the intrap.
The researchers used the laser light to write ion quantification status, while encouraging the release of the quantification of the light that was stored.
As a result, the atom's quantity and light cycle became an entangling state.
The problem is to send that light to the lighthouse.
"The light bulb released from the Kalsimion is 854 nanometers, and the light is absorbed immediately."
There, in the doctor's team, I sent the first light bulb through a non-linear shell that shot a powerful laser.
The angle of light is the most appropriate distance to move -- the standard distance of the current distance, 1550 nanometres, which is the default distance of the current distance.
He then sent this light through a 50-kilometre light bulb.
As a result of the calculations, the atoms and the light bulbs were able to maintain an intangular state, even though they changed the length of the wave or moved the distance.
"Calcium atoms have been used to capture calcium as high-quality clocks," because this experiment will result in the fact that the interconnected network in the distance between the atomic clocks is going to be achieved.
The vast Entangling Time Network is a very important area for the Earth's army from the right location, navigation, and use of time."
