I want to talk to Tom myself.
It's too difficult.
Shut up!
It's too expensive!
The wind's too lucky.
It's too much.
Now it's twelve years.
It's a typical relief of the weather.
It's either.
That's what you have to decide.
As you wish.
It's Holy Valentine's Day.
It's very dangerous here.
It's very nice of you to help me.
It's your life.
Now it's yours.

That was 2,000 years ago.
That's what I've been talking about.
It was my mistake, not Tom.
That's why it was not enough.
I didn't have to make that decision.
That wasn't necessary.
I forgot our dog, not Tom's dog.
It was Saturday night.
You know, it was Tom's fault.
It was Tom's idea, not mine.
That's what Tom did.
It was very cold.

That's what you've been suggesting to watch this movie.
It'll be cold.
It'll be worse tomorrow.
It's going to cost some $50.
