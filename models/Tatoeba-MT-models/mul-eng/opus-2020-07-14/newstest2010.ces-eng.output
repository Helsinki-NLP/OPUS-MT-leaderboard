Barack Obama will be awarded as the fourth president of the United States of America's Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to the North Osla for 26 hours to take the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American president in history.
A diploma, medals and a check of $1.4 million will be obtained in addition to extraordinary efforts to strengthen the world's diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The head of the White House will fly to the Norse Metro in the morning and with Michelle's husband and he will have it filled.
First, he is invited to the Nobel Institute, where he is the first to meet with five members of the committee chosen in October from 172 persons and 33 organisations.
The presidential couple has a planned meeting with King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
The next afternoon, the visit will highlight the celebration that Obama will take over a prestigious evaluation.
He's earned it as a fourth American president, but he's the third one who gets the price right in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war when the prize is taken over.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, because he is aware that the price is being taken over as the president who is currently fighting in two countries.
A few days ago, the great effort was still increasing by sending another unit to Afghanistan, not forgetting to highlight any of its critics.
At Obama's ceremony, he also holds gold medals, diplomas, and chess for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
They're willing to give me good intentions, but he hasn't decided on a particular chart yet.
The Nabita programme will then be held by the president of the Chechnya Bank, where it will be not only for the king of Norway but also for the Prime Minister and for the 250 other guests invited.
From the start to the price, both of them made themselves more stable.
For example, he has a feeling he doesn't deserve it.
Several times he also noticed that it is not only for him but for all those who are striving for the same value as him.
Right after the announcement, he said he was "increasing in action".
Protection of the natural person accused of excretion
The Lithuanian police accused the president of the Civil Society of the Litomerica Natural Protection Society of the Exploration.
In a number of cases over the past year, he called for some building management, and he asked investors to borrow money for his benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alan Romov.
The President of the Litomeric Society of Natural Protection is Lubomír Studentčka.
Now he's in jail and he's been in prison for three years.
Triad containers Brnu too do not hurt
In Prague, ordinary people can enjoy drinking pools, and on the South Morovian neighborhoods, you can also pass the third container on every step.
And in Brno?
That's where you won a few minutes before you find a suitable drink.
I don't want to argue that he's not going to be at Brne's.
But I'm going to say that because we're the second largest city in the Republic, they're not interested in this problem enough.
Brno is not only in the blank line of waste management because as citizens, we can still hold only paper, glass and plastics in third-party containers, but in particular the number of drunks on such waste.
Have you ever tried at the center, for example, to throw a PET layer into a collection of hair?
It's a ready-to-morrow, especially when it's time and strong nerves.
The only place I've ever seen is in Moravsk's place against the Potrefene Huse.
Don't let Mr. Anderk and his colleagues hurt me, but I'm gonna get a little damn sick.
It's not about that there's no winding up in other parts of the world.
The order of my friends doesn't make it any better.
From the woods.
They've got it all far away from the pools.
I'm not surprised.
I've offered myself for the celebration that I'm sending out a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
I just didn't see any colored dolls on the Kounic street.
Luckily, I found my way to the beach in the right place.
But the wastes from him were gone.
But it's still the center of Brna, which probably represents the city most, isn't it?
It's just ecologicals and some aesthetics that probably do not interest bronchi socialists.
This city prefers to buy a hockey extraligue that will make us a study throughout the Republic before they buy a few more containers and offer other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could have confirmed official statistics after a while on the Internet.
According to the ECO-COM company's data, Brno is really the worst in the entire country of JIHMOR.
Paroubkov's budget took money on loans and incapacitated
After adding to the opinion of the government of farmers or officials, the levies must not be in the budget of money on wages, inefficient or constructive competition.
But also on the levels of State debt or international court disputes.
This will lead to problems for those who will rule in the second half of the next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janotot.
When social democracy and communism were passed on to some groups, it was pointed out that the government would pay additional loans on sensitive expenditure, debts or incapacitated government. "It's just putting problems into the future, stealing mine," says Janot.
Of the money you've earned, you've got to pay for the higher rates, and you've got to go back.
There's no choice where to take it.
If it does not reduce the social and state-run costs, it must be taxed.
All the people on the left now: teachers, teachers, farmers.
And their children later.
There's no need to fear people, they'll get it.
However, for the price of becoming more debt - the next year will not be the same as 163 billion, but more.
Despite the fact that I'm trying to make Mr. Janoty as long as it's going faster and with him and the costs on the floor.
The state will need money on its reward and will no longer be able to increase DPH or reduce maternally as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
As a result of money transfers in favour of several groups of voters the next year will also miss five billion for the construction of the railways and railways.
It is mainly about the already advanced and dissuasive tasks that are no longer being planned and, where appropriate, reduced.
You need to save something that's not free either.
This means delay or suspension of three-thirds of the major buildings, which is also threatened by the freezing of European money, is protected by the Ministry of Transport by Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD suggested that the currency will solve the schalmounsk – sham to the ČEZ dividend, which is from most of its own, and from which the transport fund will contribute.
The problem is that the higher dividends are never certain, and they're not even talking about an empty source.
Loni added from CHEZ to budget 18 billion.
Each year, the dividend shall be paid for the eradication of ecological damage, complemented by the payment account or served as a reserve for a comprehensive pension reform.
In addition, this trend, according to the EU rules, increases the actual cost of budgeting at the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, he never lost control of his moves.
Nearly three billion have been killed in the budget for various compensations by the victim of communism and criminal acts or for expenditure on court disputes, even on construction.
If it's gonna happen without that money, it's not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we win some international war, we're going to have to pay the same amount, it's Janet.
The Minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, put it on the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing on an already developed two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which should be able to monitor on-line what the individual authorities are missing.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister hadn't found money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions would have come, it would have warned Janot.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans are counting for the future with a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single click.
The remote plans seem promising.
There are enough keys to press and you will be transferred from Windows Mobile to Android within a few seconds.
This is precisely the opportunity for the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on developing a virtual computer software.
We'll give you two user profiles on your cell phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can share them at home and at work.
Both will work in one moment and at the same time, he indicated Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware company in a computer store conversation.
It was presented in November of the last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no match.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample to journalists with two operating systems.
It was equipped with Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were currently running alongside them.
The development of new mobile technology is in full circulation.
VMware now cooperates with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and devices should be available to customers during 2012.
Not enough snow on the mountains hit the hotel
High seats don't take care only of Cronosian fans.
The lack of snow reflects people even since the order of ski resorts in hotels and pensions.
That is why in Krkonosjes they are still allowed to rent free rooms at all winter times, including Vánoc and Silvestra.
We have great insights on our pages.
People make offers, find prices, but they're still afraid to order.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask whether we think they'll be the annual Christmas on snow or on ice," said the information portal of Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants to stay in the Silveströvska in Špindler Mlýna just according to his idea, should no longer worry about the order.
Whoever gives priority to slow money and the quality of living is in it to the second place, it can still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerovše hotels are currently offering more than a week's stay on Silvestra.
I think they'll try to marry them for a while, but then they'll let and go for a while.
And then they'll be free to fight quickly," Jandura said.
A free bed in all winters is still available by a top-level travel office in Ingtors.
Now we're most interested in the holiday week that's not yet sold.
Still half the place in our offer remains free.
That's why we've already found some milder holiday stay for the last minute," Ingrusa Petr Schiefert pointed out.
Silvestra in Kronoše can also offer a high-level travel office, but less free places are available.
Well, it's going to take off for the first fourteen days in the oven, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stay has a negative impact on the fact that there are still no snow in the Krkonos.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the last year on the mountains without snow.
If they are frozen during the week, they are sold at night," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, there is something better than the entrance that can accommodate the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Peci under the Snow.
We're about five percent better on that.
We've got a few last places on Silvestra and Christmas.
It is a great interest in Polish holidays in January and is well sold," announced the director of the best cheap hotel Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the island has a silvestrov apartment and an Omnia hotel in the central park of Janski Lázní.
On the contrary, at Vánoce, there are still half of the beds available in the most recent Janskolazen hotel.
A year later, we were surprised by the ice, which we already have at this time, about 80 percent.
A little worse is still, but as soon as the snow strikes, the interest in the stay in Krkonosje is definitely still high, the hotel manager Omnia Erik Sporysch introduced.
However, for the greater benefit of snow, the cronest hotels still have to let go of the taste.
On Thursday, if there are any wars, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then he has to come back to the hotel, he informed Jiri Jakubsky of the construction of the Czech hydrometological system.
USA: Recovery is the mother of wisdom
He is as comical as Barack Obama's school champion, president of the smartest story, and he is referring to the Afghan question of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself claimed to be the most stupid one.
When he finally drank his newly expected Afghan doctrine, it was shown that he wrote it through a copyist from Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the word "as in Iraq" several times in the same text, but he did not even use the name Bush's declaration in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New road".
At the same time, three years ago he criticised Bush's idea to send pure military forces to Iraq as "unresponsible and in its consequences of a catastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy from the recommendations of full leaders was the only possible and successful way that today is not discussed in the reports on Iraq at all.
Bush did not improve this reputation, but objectively left his audience much more grateful than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the scene will be packed.
He was again called upon to raise the military contingent, particularly the top commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating practice, strongly criticised the White House's armed robbery.
He asked 40 thousand men to break the situation better.
The president was in jail for three months, but he didn't get any better, and at least he shot a total of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to expect close to 5,000 others from Europe, even though he initially counted at least 10.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to start the formation of an army from Afghanistan over 18 months ago and end this process for three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half the increase will bring the same fruit as in Iraq.
And over the last few years, the Iraqi society has been relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by a negative sign - no one can agree and no agreements are reached.
Unfortunately, under these conditions, Afghan security forces are usually prepared to change the Lord's day according to how they do it.
The political institutions, even if formally established, will only remain in a village where patriot ethnic relations will continue to prevail.
The assessment of the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex due to the invisibility of measures which are more complex in Pakistan and Iran.
Neither the "accessible state" building, which is a minimalistic goal of the whole operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy is threatening its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of the explosion.
Believe that soldiers sent to the war camps for the purpose of the "free return of home" cause a miracle done here, only souls can really be romantic, the reality is not touched.
From a political point of view, it is the determination of the date of the withdrawal of the army from their responsibilities, as Taliban will consider it to be an unacceptable recognition of American defeats.
NATO's latest summit showed that the desire of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is at the heart of the decline.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war in the area of Indonesia.
Another factor that can be radically involved in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the forced sanctions in Iran do not arise, the question arises before the United States, whether to try to solve the military force problem.
The answer will need to be answered at the right time when, according to both, the Americas is moving towards a victory from Afghanistan.
Each such solution will also mean a dramatic turn of events in the Afghan situation.
The only payment for Baracka Obama is the fact that the presidential elections last three years, and so there is still enough time for him to come with another strategy, if this appears to be a total sale.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers will no longer receive rewards in cash
High-ranking U.S. bankers Goldman Sachs won't receive cash in the annual year.
She announced that the company that reacts so to the island’s criticism of its mural practices.
A group of 30 previous managers will receive money instead of shares that will be sold first in five years.
In addition, the actions may be taken by managers in the event of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency, puts into the head the effort to connect to Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think that Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to deliver, the former investment banker of JPMMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became a target of criticism after giving up some 17 billion dollars (about 300 billion Kč) in the first three quarter of the year.
The total amount of compensation in the company for the annual year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite today's notified measure.
High payments in the banking sector have become a major political issue in a number of countries with the coming financial crisis.
The United Kingdom in the Middle East announced that a total of more than 25,000 bankers' bonuses (Zruba 72,000 Kč) would once be taxed at a rate of 12 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
This year women won Nobel's price in all fields except physics
The five record women in Stockholm today were taken from the hand of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustava of the Year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
According to four sciences, there was also a German writer of the Romanian origin of Herta Müller.
There were two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, with their country's Jack's research team in the chromosomal field.
The price for chemistry was obtained by Israel Ada Jonathan, along with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to explain the structure and functions of the fish.
The last rent was Nobel Prize for the economy that was obtained by American Elinor Ostrom and her country, Oliver Williamson, for economic management analysis.
The only professional category that took place this year without the holder was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao brought this price for research in the field of optical trains and George Smith with Willard Boyl to find a CD chip that is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical remotes.
Each evaluated took over a diploma, Nobel medals and a certificate of financial rewards.
This in each category reaches ten million Swedish kroner (a total of 25 million Kč).
If they're prominent in each of them, I'll take care of them.
Traditionally the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has already been held this afternoon in the North Oslo of the American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the contradiction of his assessment, because he was just at the beginning of his drama and was in front of the country that led two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
However, he added that the wars are in a certain position necessary to combat peace, even though the price for that is high.
Minister Janotot's taking the commissions.
President Václav Klaus will take on Friday morning Minister of Finance Eduardo Janotu, who is responsible for holding in government, because he does not agree with the kind of state budget for the next year, as she was admitted in the middle of the Polish dream.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps Janot's stay in the office will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The start is critical of Klaus.
According to him, there is a very high deficit, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
He informed the President of the meeting of the speaker, Radim Ogvat.
Janot wants to meet with Prime Minister Jane Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, which Klaus will now receive to sign, the Czech Republic would have to finance a total of 163 billion dollars.
In the middle of the summer, however, the left-wing proposals agreed on transfer of money and raised money on public employees' wages, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has made proposals for social democracy to cover the hidden cost of the budget.
Among the leftovers on one hand and on the other, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a sharp internal-political dispute as a result of which he began to raise his question about the next operation of the Fischier official's office on which ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted in the summer, is essentially liquidating the package of countermeasures that the Government of Fischer has proposed and which, according to it, has to stop the State's lending.
Klaus, who is a law on national budgets, but must also not sign, at today's discussion dinner with businessmen, stated that politicians have long forgotten "a serious problem", which is "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He says there's no good solution today.
The improvement could only bring about a strong government, which could also be concerned about the wider consensus of the political parties, Mr. President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is terrible and the government should consider another existence.
The president of ODS Petr Necess told ČTK that the concept of the official office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and greens is not clearly functioning.
Prime Minister Fischer in response noted similar words for "strong products".
Chief of the ČSSD Jírí Paroubek at Topolanka responded to the words that a terrible budget was prepared by the former Government of Topolan for this year, which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
In the medium term, ČSSD indicated the approval of the state budget for the next year for success.
They were calm, too.
You played Morgan Freeman in the newspaper Clinta Eastwood.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The undisputed world has a lot to say about the country, its war, and its victories despite some criticism that the major role of American kings is being created.
The story is about sports, racial dimensions, and Nelson Mandel.
An outstanding warrior against the racist regime of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa and its first Black President Nelson Mandela in his life story is the U.S. Oscar Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said a 17-year-old Mandela asked if he could make it in Eastwood's movie.
Another significant role he plays is Matt Damon.
I said, "When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
A 20-year-old hero who received the prize for a role in Eastwood drama from the middle of a box of millions of dollars Baby, has already created, for example, a guide for child destruction, from which he eventually became a child, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in God’s Evan, but only someone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years old in prison for his active work to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and then in four years became president of the country.
In 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded.
Invictus is a Latin word for uninterrupted and is the name of English author William Ernest Henry of 1875.
The export was talked like he was.
The picture is a true story of how Nelson Mandela worked with the captain of the South African gang team to help unite the country. The newly elected president of Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided after the apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to join the bandy player who belongs to the world-wide dimension between outsiders.
The South African team finally arrives at the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story to pay off.
I had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring her closer to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
Herec said that if he and the world's politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandelo, to have an evening with him, to be in jail before his appearance.
The most important thing was that he wanted Mandel to hold his hand.
I found out that when I'm printing your hand, I'm taking your energy, it's moving, and I had a feeling I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to be with another person.
Matt Damon is filming Françoise Pienaar, the captain of the national gang team in which white players were considered.
Herec said he had six months to prepare for his role in a hard-core world.
It was a great surprise for him finally when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember how I called at my home, he opened up to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much more like a movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the position of priests compared with their actual proposals under the leadership of Director Eastwood, Invictus received an unexpected good review and talks about ambitions in Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety Todd McCarthy’s list of the series “It was very good news, very good film done.”
In film reviews on the website rottenmatoes.com, Invictus received 76% of positive evaluations.
The secret of the mirror over Norway is resolved: Russian rocket tests
It was possible to observe the special light effect of unknown origin on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence first admitted yesterday that the nearby Norwegian border tested the intercontinental ballistic missile.
But the start was a failure and the shooting was again marked as a type of "Bulava", which was supposed to be originally a clumsy Russian army, gradually becoming a black mass of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in rocket tests had no beneficial effect on the success of experimental years.
Most of the bugs didn't get hurt or hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers, it's called "Bulave" as "a rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This in order of 13 has been a regular start.
By the end of the year, it was back to the technical damage of the device.
He must have fired the engine at the third level of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" began with the atomic subnortics of Dmitry Donski, who wept under the cold of the White Sea.
This type of rocket also allows the launch of a ship that is in motion and is at the same time detonated.
Therefore, it is likely that the western light caused by Norway is closer to the unaccompanied flying object, which was actually recommended by "Bulava".
Last of all, Norway has been wondering since the first time it's about Russian rockets.
This time, generals defend themselves and claim they can't talk about success in a single way.
The first two levels of rockets survived and the accident reached the third.
In the past, the engines were immediately consulted at the first level.
Even though not all mistakes have been made at least one experimental start, the failed leadership of the defence ministry is only six-thirds of its success.
Almost a dozen percent success, therefore, complements optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will once fly without problems and that it will even take up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum mass of 1,15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetis signed an annual contract in CSKA Moscow in 51 years
The legendary version of Vjačeslav Fetisov is again presented in a professional hockey race in 51 years.
The former lord of the world, the Olympic winner and the Stanley Cup holder will help his team in the pursuit of the CSKA Moscow team and will appear to be in the KHL battleground against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who finished his career in the fourth year of 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Dennis Kujaš was injured, we need another turn.
Fatis regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to figure out some formal options, quoted the AP agency's team of the Moscow club Sergey Germany.
It's still not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockeys will affect only one race.
I think Fatisov is one of those who can call the spirits of other players, introduced Germany.
Fetisov will thus become the oldest Russian professional hockeyist in the case of a return to ice.
In NHL, he played in the 11th anniversary of the entire Hartford season, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe, and joined 15 heads and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Castonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockeyists of history.
In the spring of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven crowns of the world, triumphed on Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he collected success in NHL, where he twice raised the head of Stanley Cup in Detroit.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey Union.
Hyundai's been calling the committees.
The management of Hyundai's footcar agreed with the committees to cancel all the breaks.
In view of the frequent schedules, the committees in the field of standby preparedness announced.
He confirmed it to the linguists of Hyundai Petr Vanék.
However, the board wishes to agree with the committee on another annual Saturday change.
We cannot refuse our production plan, which is essential, so it was planned on Saturday, 19 December, with two changes to make, Vanék said.
Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who are working on the Saturday shift offered 400 Kč bonus.
They'll get people back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanuka, the company decided to change the way in which employees are motivated for a proposed period of time.
Whether they are allowed to make an application for a holiday or they can choose a reward holiday on December 28th, and then on the afternoon to extend the holiday, Vanék said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive paid rides and lunch.
In view of the fact that the period was the most unwarranted and most palatable point in view of the memory and the difficulties of the committee and the protestors, which had left the product alive last week, Vanék introduced yesterday's ruling on the immediate payment of all the deadlines in the month of December.
In the past week, the car staff were practically forced every day after the eight-year change to work for another two-year period.
Following the signature of the Agreement, the Committees shall adopt a standing declaration
The next meeting between the driving of the car and the pickup shall be held on Friday afternoon.
The chief of the committees of Petr Kucharj in the middle said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a common document, they are prepared to delete the status quo.
The situation in the car increased last week in the middle when the crowd of 400 employees stood spontaneously because of the constant hours.
They also protested against bad tax conditions and misinformation.
The management stated that workers must be employed in the meantime in order to meet the requirements for the provision of cars.
The committee also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who had previously suspended their production.
In the area of time-consuming companies, the companies require that they reduce their temporary work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5000 crowns in the year.
Hyundai's noswich car now employs 2000 people.
The company's serial production broke down in November.
In the summer she made 80,000 cars, and her current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech phenomenon: a substance that is also responsible for HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new strains that can reduce the spread of HIV in the body.
The main benefit of improved substances is that it also collects the resources already obtained against immunosuppressants.
In some cases, this fact is overestimated by the fact that exposure to the usual variant of the virus does not affect as much as is already available.
The disease of AIDS cannot be treated at any time.
Patients, however, may significantly prolong the life of the combination of medicines that prevent the accumulation of HIV in the body.
However, their use has a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete accumulation of virus has resulted in the development of such resistant viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VCHCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistant virus.
It has been shown that the substances called metallocarbone cause protein responsible for the accumulation of HIV.
Metal carbonates are mixed with war, water, coal and cobalt.
These ingredients block the spread of the virus other than all medicines used today and can therefore overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their vertebral protein bindings.
Metal carbides have the only three-dimensional structure: two multi-layered cells created by the atoms of war, hydrogen and carbon are produced by the atom, in this case by cobalt.
Vulnerable and offal virus
HIV protease is HIV protein, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV infection, adult viral components would not be present.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop spreading virus in the patient's body, the scientists in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemist Academy of Sciences of the CR.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe the series of students in which two pairs of cells (see table) are produced by a short organic grid that is still systematically modified.
Something worse, but more balanced.
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the study and also in its low (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarbons on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinical trials of the medicinal products used, but its effect is not lost for the resistant variants against which medicines are often not effective.
The unique mechanism of effect and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical reforms, as well as metalocarbons, make interesting conclusions for further research on the proposal for effective HIV medicines, says Pavlín Rézečová, the leading laboratory for Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The deal for the budget. ODS has left to Fischer, he's defending himself.
Head of ODS Mirek Topolánek has marked the approved budget for the next year for "dangerous" and the government of Prime Minister Jana Fischer should consider another existence, according to him.
The ODS statement was signed by the President of the Government for strong products.
He's leaving the analysis for the first time.
The president of ODS Petr Neces said that the concept of the official office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and Green Party is not clearly functioning.
The President of the Government has to decide, according to the Time, whether he is willing to decide in a dream about a minority which is about to fight a growing deficit or whether he is to be held in office by means of a parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, warns the Time.
In the medium term, it adopted the 2010 budget, as well as the leftover amendments for more than 12 billion kroner.
The dream has raised money to pay public employees, to carry out social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's success at the address of the proposals for social democracy was the fact that the hidden treasure of the budget was hidden.
The PRC should finance a total of 163 billion kroner.
Before the vote, the ODS withdrew from the Chamber, so that the amended budget was less a bad option than the budget for the budget.
Degrading and marginalisation
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke about the deterioration and sense of belonging, Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still considering the situation.
It is not time to believe that if Janot was seriously threatened by the resignation of the function in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech TV, Janot was ordered on Monday by the government to the Prime Minister.
He meant that he considered another maintenance in function.
The reason is his decline in the budget.
If Fischer is speaking for another battle with the score of the budget, they do not, according to Time, in the government, what to do to appoint ČSSD, which changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will give exemptions if he accepts further laws that raise the deficit, such as those relating to the weak, pensions or the new service law.
Toplank: Ministers of the designation of ODS failed
It's the matter of the Ministerial President of Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nomination ministers did nothing wrong, highlighted Topolanek in a text report from the United States.
He pointed out that, in some ministries, there are people in municipal functions voting against TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
It has been pointed out that if Fischer decides to reject the principle of combating the high cost of public finances, "it's simply logical and correct that he is opposed to the majority of the left, which is currently in the dream."
Then he can't count on the support and tolerance of citizens' democracies.
I didn't think about it, and when it's happening, I'm going to blame it, said to reporters in the shadow defense minister Martin Barták, who was appointed by the government as a citizen of democracy.
The President of the Council of Europe, Mr Fischer, went to Brussels this afternoon.
At the request of the ODS Prime Minister
At the same time, he pointed out that ODS would vote in the middle of the amended budget, obviously against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask for the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear to be poor, we are not small children, then we have responded to the question whether the ODS did not find it difficult to take the position of the President of Parliament and the Czech Republic in political statement on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice would fail.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months, especially in the wake of the horror and destruction of all the positive, Topolanek himself would react.
According to the new CD series, less trains are eaten than nearly the same train
The Czech dragons since December 13 break down or limit some less complicated speeds and locations, other than they do.
The total volume of transport is reduced from the date of the payment of the new train order by 2 per cent compared to today.
Most of the tariffs, including basic and customer traffic, shall not be changed.
For example, the people of Ostravska have more opportunities to connect to the main city, the dragons add one pendolin.
On the contrary, the lion will stop going to Bratislava.
Less speeds are also available on Praha - Pisek - České Budějovice, mainly limited directly to Praha - Letohrad.
In the regions, the main reduction of transport in the Kingdom country, which is about eight per cent, is expected to increase in Prague and the environment.
It also rotates two night trains on the Praha route - Tábor - České Budějovice and runs several speeds on Praha - Písek - České Budějovice is limited to a few days a week.
For the biggest change is the introduction of new direct lines from Milovic to Prague, today Milovicti has to move to Lysé over Labe.
It's about fifteen direct lines of the Esko system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electricity processing from Lysé over Labe to Milovic.
The long connections to the main city will end at Prague Main Station.
The ČD includes more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Schumperka/Jeseník will take place in two-year intervals.
The pendoline to Bratislava is no longer connected from December 13.
Annual accounts for regional railways: more than 200 million
As soon as it orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, in full compensation for the so-called loss of evidence, I would like to spend the next year four billion crowns, as well as the year. Locals order countries to pay for the next year eight billion crowns, while few three billion countries are contributing to the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
On the premises and the fasts have a newly closed ten-year contract, the contract has always been for one year.
The dragons are proud of the system, and they are obviously not able to increase the price of the tree in most of the way.
To change it will only be available on single network routes to ČD Net and on eLiška’s left internet lists.
For travel without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLišky will be renewed from the narrow distance, it has long been one-way between the popular national cities and made 160 crowns.
The Philippines's armed forces are still holding over 50 people, children are released
Today, armed men in the southern Philippines have sent 75 people, including a few basic schools and their teachers.
It was introduced by the AFP agency, which informed the original of only 65 injured persons.
All 17 detained children were released within eight hours, including one teacher.
We arrived in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 armed men use their hands as a live shield when running before the police.
Local publishers are now trying to agree to the release of the remaining hands.
According to AFP, weapons belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is armed by the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP police agency, it was originally forced by violence, which required the removal of accounts between two local family clinics.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Magindano, a recent massacre involving 57 people was declared a state of law.
Among the victims of massacres on 23 November, 30 journalists were involved in elections to the government.
In order to suspect participation in the massacre, the governor of this Yohophilipine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, were arrested by the patriarch of the influenced Ampatuan family.
On the island of Mindanao are also Muslim separatists.
But in the afternoon, they renewed their peace talks with the Philippines government.
The JAR event concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The next day, a new Hollywood film by Clinta Eastwood Invictus (a official name in the Czech name Invictus: Undisclosed) will come to the American cinema, which attracts part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandely.
The role of a conscious warrior against apartheid was raised by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
The next man's role of the legendary South African champion in the Francoise Pienaar race was raised by Matt Damon.
Introducing the picture into the kitchen is made up of critical and public voices
Nelson Mandela
As a whole name, Nelson Rollichal Mandela was born on June 18, 1918, in the South African Union.
In 1988, Sachar received the price for freedom of thought, and in 1993 he and De Klerek Nobel won the prize of peace.
The President of the Republic of South Africa was in 1994-1999.
big expectations, because it comes to public during the time when, in the Republic of South Africa, however, preparations for a global football campaign are high, but the media are also alarming news of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the people of the Black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the voices of a new film in JAR have been very positive throughout the course of the world, and over the many benefits of the "proflavable" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, according to his words on the new film, is proud.
I've been dreaming about that role for a long time, and I've prepared well for it.
Many times I also met with Nelson Mandel, so that, as it is said, he spent his energy, introduced himself to a speech after the famous film Prime Minister in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandel's personality and message by film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everyone, he added.
In the course of the national team of rugby
Photo based on the book presentation by British writer John Carlina with a freely translated name In the role of enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that enabled the nation to become a national portrait of the human rights of South Africa during his first presidential period.
Thus, Morgan Freeman, during the film, tries to stamp two races, and after a long year of mutually differentiated population groups, as well as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, also joins him in a hierarchical role in South Africa's national football competition at the World War, which was then won by JAR.
For the entrance to the feast, which was understood to be almost as sacred in JAR, a large flock of sheep overtly whites of the white public was sealed four years ago and received recognition of the white population.
The football team may be able to re-connect people into one nation, introduced the gruesome player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
If the pressure situation in the JAR improves, it will be shown first.
The whites of South Africa, however, are skeptical, as was the case in the recent LN speech, produced a fan of gubby Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The champion will start on 11 June 2010.
On Lounska, the transformer for tens of millions of crowns
The fire took place in the morning as a transformer of the company Čeps in the village of the University of Lounsk.
The fire contains six units of Lukáše Marvana, according to the linguistic national prosecutors.
Initially, the propellers wanted to let the transformer go up, but later their views were reviewed and the fire was mixed with water, bread and special waste.
The reason was the technical undertaking, the internal closure of the transformer.
No one has been injured, according to Pauly Mandát’s speech company, does not threaten the safe operation of the transport system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, exactly counting it until the end of the fire.
The removed transformer will be replaced by a new one according to the Mandate.
In the ten years of the Czech company's operations nothing like this has happened, the causes of this type have been united, complemented.
The supply of electricity was not affected by the Czech-speaking company for the north Czech Soni Holinger Hendrych, the operation of households, the authorities or the company of the Trafostance fire.
A.s. Čeps acts on the territory of Česka as an excellent transport system operator, 400 kV and 220 kV electric driver.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 solutions with 67 transformers transferable electrical energy from transmission to distribution system and track of direction of 4339 km.
Jancura gives a criminal notice for a three-hétman interview with ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jancura gives a criminal notice for a speech on three social-democratic Hetmans.
And it's on Michala Haszka from the Juhmorrav region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubic region and the Hetman from the Olomouk region of Martin Tesariík.
Jancura introduced it in the twenty-minute radio station.
The application relates to the efforts of companies to carry out regional rail transport in some countries.
But all the regions finally signed long contracts with the Czech dragons.
All three hostages attack us and talk about our choice of polls, and then we offer only what they want.
He says we're more expensive than the Czech dragons, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech dragons that were closed last week.
So we don't have to defend ourselves.
It's for a talk about the Student Agency, said the Radio Journal of Jancura.
He also pointed out that he has evidence from all countries that they have not taken their steps in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares for the European Commission.
Hašek, giving a criminal notice, is considered to continue the media show of Mr Jančuri, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own.
I am reasonably prepared to defend the good name of my country and my country and to call on the same name and the rest of the hostages.
I assume that even on this occasion it is clear that it is really Mr Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hasek.
Jancura has already announced last week that she invests several million crowns in advertising that will warn countries of an inevitable step.
The radio station said that the campaign after Christmas is interrupting and wants to continue in it after New Year.
He insisted that the campaign be known against corruption as such.
The campaign began in Jancura after the countries agreed to establish regional rail connections with Czech dragons, and the ban of about 150 billion kroner did not issue tenders.
According to Jancuri, it is similar to the anti-legislative and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
In response to the criticism of train transport in the countries, Jançor also threatened the ČSSD mission.
The only exception was that if we don't stop it, we can get a bus license.
He represented himself as a messenger of the ČSSD, I know what your name is, I'm not saying, said to Radiojörnán Jancura today.
Waiting for tyres to be free and not required
Waiting against the pneumocks from winter collects the usual habits.
He's got to be the first for the family to be free and at the same time not to be required.
But the voices are calling for more effective expectations.
Preparations for the introduction of free expectation of pneumococcals.
The medicinal product is already at maximum vaccine prices, which will pay health insurance.
The team members are also clearly in the process of waiting.
New Waiting
Vaccines free of charge for children
From January, children born on and after August 2nd can be expected free of charge against pneumococomas.
The point is they haven't even got a single dose of waiting.
Whoever starts to wait for the moon or before, he has to buy himself another reprieve.
The first dose should be given between 3 and 5 months of age of the child.
Last year, she willingly left her children to wait against the pneumocks of the fourth family.
The parents then paid 1600 kroner for a single dose and more.
Four doses are needed when waiting for the youngest children.
All experts estimate that health insurance issues at the expected dose of 300 to 450 thousand kroner per year.
But it's a cure that children would need without waiting.
To date, the state of the child’s entire life expectancy has been estimated to be 500 thousand a year.
The songd expectation was introduced by the so-called Janot ball.
Pneumococcal causes heart attacks, but also serious infections, including strokes of the brain’s white blood cells and food.
On a pneumococcal infection in us every year, he dies in hospitals up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to Česka, there have been widespread expectations of children against pneumonia in about 40 countries.
Will waiting be necessary?
At the same time, however, the opinion that this expectation may be binding in the future is manifest.
From now on, it must be decorated with insurance and non-compulsory.
For example, the head of the civil society Naḥs Rudolph Kalovský would be required to wait better.
His association of pneumock vaccines has long promoted.
The members of the international conference that our association attended were not fully satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we're happy to have been able to spend at least that.
I think it's the road we've got to get into, the Kalolsky.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the process of waiting against pneumonia.
At this point, we don't even think about it, his spokesman, Mr. Sršen, said.
Voluntary expectation has its consequences, doctors insist.
The President of the Committee of the Practical Children's Doctors of Hana Cabrnokh acknowledges that he has voluntary expectations of his own shortcomings.
If all children are expected, it could be considered a reduction in the number of waitings "For the situation when these vaccines are so high, we understand the political decision that this expectation has been launched as voluntary," said Cabrnoch.
The team members expect their horses to stop waiting for pneumococomas for more than 80 percent of clean parents in the next year.
Waiting against pneumococcals is too late, and the fact that as the first flat waiting for children, it's a health insurance, not a state.
Insurance should pay money to prevent, save it for another treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own stuff.
However, this relates to the care of practical child doctors who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines should be purchased by insurance and doctors should receive them in the same way as the state provides them with other preparations.
However, some Members feared that they would be able to ensure that they would "retain money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy and wait until they are given insurance benefits.
According to estimates, individual practical children will invest 40 thousand months in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist's' thief in the museum'
The son of a renowned American artist, Frank Frazetta, was accused of trying to take pictures of 20 million dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police indicated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was attached to 90 images in his vehicle and transport.
Mr Frazetta and the other man used to enter the museum in the Poconco Mountains borr region.
Mr Frazetta Senior, 81, celebrated the creation of Barbara Conana and Tarzana.
When that happened, the artist found himself in Florida, as the printing agency Associated Press mentioned.
The AP quoted a designated police officer who indicated that Mr Frazetta could be motivated by long-term family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta issued a young press release, 52 years of age, that he did so on his father's instructions, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move the images into the cool spaces," the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta, the senior officer has issued any permit as the agency has indicated.
Laborists protect the planned increase in taxes
The Ministers accused the increase in taxes and cuts in expenditure reported in the preliminary report on the budget against the criticism by opposition, businessmen and committees.
As Alistair Darling pointed out, Toryo's "advanced" opportunity to show that they think that they are seriously considering a decision to reduce deficit until after the elections.
And the cancler was hit by low- and middle-income workers.
According to its proposal, it mainly covers an increase of 0.5 % in social insurance and 1 % in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Difference in social security
The committees protested that low-income workers were tortured for delays that they did not regret and warned against "problems".
Social security is increasing - growth is making about 3 billion blocs a year - which has caused the community of entrepreneurs to feel that one of the taxes on employment should be reimbursed while the economy should be reimbursed.
This increase, which limits these revenues above 20,000 pounds per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PBR CLICHICAL BADS
Social insurance increases by 0.5 % from April 2011
The economic situation is higher than expected by 4.75% in this year
New payment of 50 % of bankers' bonus
1% tax on small companies for subscriptions
Reduction of taxes on electric vehicles and windscreens
Increase in the rate of 2,5 %
According to the National Financial Administration, some revenue of 30000 pounds decreases by 90 pounds per year and some revenue of 40000 pounds by 190 pounds, while some of the revenues of 10000 pounds increase by 110 pounds.
Ministers announced that their target of reducing deficit by half by 2013, was "consolidated decision", but continued that 60% of special data should be allocated to 5% of the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms suggested that the proposed increase in taxes and expenditure reduction would be "catch in the ocean" compared to what would be necessary.
"It's a big number. This is a way of reducing our deficit by half, which is absolutely a basic requirement for the next four years," BBC said.
Mr Timms indicated that he was convinced that economic growth should take place in the past year.
But the development of projections for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the size of the necessary loans and on how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the office has been given to review previous parts.
In your opinion, the economic downturn was 4.75% this year - far higher than the 3,5%, predicted in depth - because loans were 3 billion freer than were previously awarded.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Conservatives who launched a new propaganda campaign on Thursday, protecting workers from the "debt crisis" have marked the planned loan of 789 billion free during the next six years.
When the ministers announced a credible plan, how it could be rewarded, they added, "cynics" abandoned this decision until after the elections - which must take place in June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant to what would be feasible," said financial minister Philip Hammond. "They had the chance to do it, but they missed it."
"All important notifications will be made after the election if we win"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The labs insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future damages in the way of Tory's proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and in greater proportion.
But liberal Democrats claim that the money earned by the increase in taxes and expenditure should be used to support expenditure in the coming year and not to reduce deficits, and argue that plans are "based on sand".
Political commentator BBC Nick Robinson pointed out the timing of the communication - for example, the above inflation increases and is due to the inability to pay the dose in the next depth - that this could lead to the claim of the office in a volunteer campaign if the money would be hard to get back in a year later.
But the labs continue to provide special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be resolved in September 2010.
Immediate budgets'
Although the ministers did not disclose the details of expenditure after 2011, the economy indicated that it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would be only the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
The Institute for Accounting Studies reported that office figures indicate essential gaps in many areas, possibly involving transport, higher education and protection in the future.
"It's really very painful now," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important announcements will come after the elections, if we win," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the auditor of the Deloitte accounts.
"It was a report of a suspected preliminary budget.
FBI conducts investigations at 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI conducts investigations at Pakistan Prison in five Americans suspected of being involved in extremism.
Men were arrested for an attack on a house in Sargod in the province of eastern Pandjab, as the BBC announced an American embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was about an investigation whether it was about the same men who were reported missing in their last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that it is also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are claimed to be the origins of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the others come from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and what circumstances they were held there," said the speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit reported that the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with families of the missing students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities to identify their identity and conduct their conduct here and whether there is really one of the wrong students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington indicated that men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
It indicated that the house was always a matter of interest to the local police and that there was no charge against the arrested men yet.
Foreign Minister Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, sent a press agency Reuters, but pointed out that the United States must "co-operate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the destruction of the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Absence of amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in maintaining human rights in Iran is the same as in the last 20 years, as the Amnesty International Group's report suggests.
The report describes "the means of torture" in the regime before and after the presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beat and burned with cigarettes, and the other said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected the above criticism of this report on the observance of human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed after President Mahmud Ahmadinezad's campaign, leading to the greatest street demonstration since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were arrested and the complainants sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC writer John Leyne, who is now in London, stated that former in the protests of the highest leader of Ajajtoláh Ali Komimí declared inadmissibility of some of the ways of torture and prohibiting their execution in the Karizak device.
But since then, there has been no criticism of legal power as our writer introduced it.
Improper recognition'
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old student's report of the team of accounting technician Ibrahim Metari, who stated that he was accused of "the network of Facebook" and protests against the results of the vote.
"I was often in my face," he pointed out in the statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty introduced.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Charroub was defeated after the protests were held after the elections and was sentenced to death in prison and the others were raped.
In Iran, higher government officials filed charges of rape, but admitted that it was a torture.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an former prisoner who indicated that he had been held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in a prison in Karzak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the Justice had organized committees to investigate the arbitrary and reaction of the government, but indicated that the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were published.
The group indicated that at least 90 persons had been detained in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park were made of wooden furniture
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to change the memory in Bristol in a sederary race for the race.
16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders were attracted to the park to compete for the financial price.
At the top of the seating hall in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump bridge before 100 m long seating.
A fourth-year-old medical student, John Hickman, said that it was a beautiful view of the height of sedentary dragons, but it was really exciting.
It was a beautiful view of the surrounding lights of the city down.
Here were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them are really talented," he added.
Prices have been made for the best tastes - or manoeuvres on the sedentary drive.
After the fourth night of the game, the dreams were left to break.
They're still mine.
Can I be a Muslim in France?
Pluralism and pragmatism in secular states.
During the time when Swiss voters called on the ban on the construction of minerals and generally spread news of certain Islamism in Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and integrate - into one of the most undisputed secular societies in the continent.
After reading this book, some of the readers were surprised by the author of the last work, "Why Francozi doesn't like the hats on his head" (2006), this elegant and controversial study on the issues that have divided and occupied countries for 15 years and their consequences are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious collection.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politics and the media have taught about Islam in France but what really happened on the basis of it.
He spent a whole month in museums, schools and institutions that are now about 5 0.000 6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing discussions between teachers and students about issues that are most worrying.
Should I enter the marriage union in the city or at the workplace (or both places)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if you want to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly global disputes that are discussed and that are part of everyday life more than political dramas that are playing the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known persons, not including Tarika Ramadan, Arab, Muslim researcher and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up discussions on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They don't have any arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are untrustworthy to the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophy and activists with whom Mr. Bowen conducted an interview claim to be against Selafi—suppressors of Puritan Sunni Islam, united in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen is believed to be the case for Muslim values and French secularism.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
The question of how far the French policies are (and intellectual elites, which so often defends the laic public) is actually given the thought of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims are likely to have less experience in religious matters than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historic compromises with secular republican republics.
More than the development of pragmatism, it's found "the value of raw materials".
After reading this book, someone may have the habit of saying, "Yes, but not now."
The Safest Views in the World
The Arctic is changing faster than the rest of the planet's environment.
It's threatening these alarming speeds, which have an effect on animals and their survival as never before.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on the new natural water source, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their promotion.
In the book "On the Dark Side" Richard Ellis, writer and illustration, looks like the natural history of the icon of the North, the Polish bear.
A well-known complicated history and the healing process describes the long tradition of Polish researchers who have tried to strengthen the white bear.
The meeting of Nelson with a brave fourteen-year-old sailor who fought only with a man's ball is really a myth, but all the others are true.
The young bears who sailed their own dead mothers were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 Polish bears appeared in one circus building.
Even today buildings in the zoo have typical area millions of times less than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is quite suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the yellow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis is taking advantage of the work of other writers and historians, and he often returns to the threat of being threatened by hunters.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greece and Canada, where the helicopters and Indians are on their way, and they are all armed with powerful attackers who shoot their prey.
It's ironic that it's playing in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that ice will finally be the largest.
In his new book "After the Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor New Scientist, offers clear and unsatisfied responsibility for the science for Arctic and a fascinating summer view of how it can change its future.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have adequate response to the rapid change.
That's because there's no test.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the research roads of Fridtjofa Nansen first identified how the ice moves.
The Ponnorks for the students of the war then took off the confluences when they subjugated.
Satellite research and extensive field probes are useful supplements, but many continue to run thanks to undamaged individuals camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks at the world of the Greek sandy system within the Arctic ice, created by a mixture of salted water that melts when it is cold.
However, from the height of this bear to the microscopic particles inside, all of this is due to the decline in the annual ice, which is sometimes reflected between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that could be us.
6000 seafarers placed prisoners at the graveyards in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple prisoner on a soldier's grave, who never sat with him.
For him and the other marine crews who traveled from Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Corps, in Arlington, to earn a fortune, it was the day when men and women who once wore the same dress.
In a few months when we got married, we could be us, Robinson told us about fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me to show me the way I'm trying to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put the prisoners on the Croatian veterans in a number of departments in the Southern Arlington Act.
In 1992, Morris Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to recover several hundred graveyards during the second act in Arlington.
Now it's been 18 years old tradition when Mr. NMorill takes this trip with his wife Karen every year and stops in different cities along the road to get the memory of members of the army and the victims of terrorism.
Worcesters are not looking for a profit.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wines in Arlington County, in the province of Pentagon, on the grounds of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Battery Park, New York City, and on the monumental site of 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
In the second year, Walmart owes more than $150,000 to the purchase and transport of goods.
Charlene Hunt, 70, from Westminster, indicated that she had made her way to Arlington to the honor of her husband, a retired member of the armed forces.
Because her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt pointed out that it was her way to return what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family funeral visit.
Contained in the plates of the hot material, volunteers passed through the grasses by the surrounding reeds and pears.
Volunteers targeted older graves from the first and second world wars and war in Vietnam because they are not visited as often as new graves
Nasada was positive when the children played and held their hands together as they carried the young bourgeoises to their bare feet.
Each round prisoner was dark green with a small red cross on top of the upper part.
Close to section 60, where most of the veterans from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have remained really quiet.
The Joint Service Organisations paid 1,000 awards for the division, but the southern regime just filled this area.
Some cried honestly, others prayed, and family and friends held each other in a cold air.
Some read the title of the name, thrown into the stones, while others agreed to look at the small black names drawn into the dark blue where no stone was yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who lost tears in her eyes before her son's grave.
It took eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last place of rest of the army officer David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in June.
No one should ever forget why we're free to pay my son for it, rule.
"Even if I've been away a long time, I want to be the one who's gonna remember it."
U.S. government supplier bound by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government hired an American government contributor who brought mobile phones and laptops to the country, as announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
A provider who has not been identified has been working for the Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the American Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detained person who was arrested on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been published, but, according to Cuban law, Cuban citizens or foreigners may be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including peaceful protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and words are considered to be serious criminal acts.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and burdened by government agencies.
Mrs. Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country so that she could take over the prices, but her permission was granted.
The arrest of an American supplier may be the result of growing tension between the Communist Castor brother, governor of Cuba, and Obama's administration, which has been seen as a "containing tactic" in improving relations with the island.
As the first news of the New York Times arrest on Friday night.
A new American policy has highlighted that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as leaving political prisons and creating more space for opposition, the United States will take decisive steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed on Cuba, although they are new and sought in the country where the average public employee's potential is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones right this year; they are used mostly by sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would be more than one day.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government facilities, such as universities.
The Cubans who often want to sign up have to make their name known to the government.
Access to many websites is forbidden.
The American detention in Cuba is a priority.
Most of the U.S. citizens in the Cuban prison are behind the networks for drug trafficking, such as drug trafficking, introduced by Gloria Berben, Press Office of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said he couldn't provide more information on prison.
Prisons and detentions were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which in every other open society would be legal - given to the free mobile phones - are criminal in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Programme, who recently published an unacceptable report on freedom in Cuba, called "New Castro, father of Cuba," as a threat to the installation of Raula Castra as the leader of the country and reward for the deaf brother of Fidel.
Vivanco said that complaints are often closed, connected and imprisoned in one day.
He pointed out that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often triggers negative reactions in the United States, just as these two countries are focusing on a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are covering the crackdowns concerning the dispatch of men to Afghanistan.
In Saturday, the Pakistani authorities issued a report on the release of five men from north Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American units, and they hoped that this case could help cover the wide network of terrorists who follow the Internet and seek radicalized young men.
The investigators indicated that after the seven rebel personalities, known as Saifulláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after what he first announced when one of these men published a comment approving terrorist attacks on YouTube's Internet video sites.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men when they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to the remote region of Pakistan in the sands of the native tribes of Pakistan, which is the home of al-Qaedy and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But the Pakistani media officer who reported the case indicated on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in certifying al-Qaedy leaders and that men were not part of the CIA's investigation into the terrorist network.
As a result, they were excavated a few days to the east quarter of Sarghody, far from the terrible mountains in the northwestern part, which became the target of terrorist attacks.
They were considered to be an official unit.
That is why they were exaggerated, the officer who spoke about maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that the men were not afraid and were still trying to reach agreement on access to al-Qaedy camps when they were arrested by the enforcement of Pakistani law.
The case of this fifth - which remained in Pakistan and was heard by the FBI - highlights the critical role of observers in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has placed the highest priority on the efforts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The federations act as guards, identifying those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the Holy War and those who could be explorers.
The U.S. fake recruits were detailed in al-Qaedy's special investigation, led by analysts.
However, they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, as their potential access to the American goals and their promotional value was taken into account.
But Evan Kohlmann, an older analysis of the NEFA award in the United States, noted that in recent years terrorist groups have also become much more careful in what is possible to access it because American reporting agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we're trying to get into these groups, there's no better way than to act according to their model of assembly, which has already been followed?
This model is one of those that are far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodana, demanding climate action
Tens of protestors went through the streets on this Saturday and requested more thorough action on climate than delegates at the city congress centre of Bella.
The protestors pointed out the number of participants in the event, but the police insist that the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed several small deposits near the government building group in the city centre.
On the day that a small event took place during the discussions on the climate that was sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists went through the city and did not send transparency with English letters "This is not planet B" (i.e. second class) and one in Spanish who voted "The Earth says " Enough".
A number of Celebrites participated, including Danish models and photographs of Helena Christensen, who indicated that she traveled to her mother's home in Peru and provided me with information on the sad state of the country where the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That's part of the reason why we decided to join this big step -- go through the world and appeal to the world's leading personalities to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a simple task, but it's necessary to do it, it can't be avoided.
The police prevented protestors from approaching the center of Bella and indicated that she had detained 19 people, in the first row, because they had found any masks or had a baggy knife in them.
These activities are prohibited under customs law during the demonstration.
According to one of the unaccompanied savages who do not wish to be identified, it is linked to climate talks, active masking as sportsmen, and in black clothing, several posts have been placed near the Kodian main channel, which is close to several ministers.
They were active in the buildings, he pointed out, they were distracted by the lights, but then it was followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the departure during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not lead to the knowledge of key officials, such as Su Wei, the main Chinese climate director.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international conduct, he answered the English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact it is something I do not know).
Then he went on in fact and said, "Because it's really huge, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He wondered whether the source was sick or helpful depending on the views of everyone.
It is to see the focus of the broad public and the different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the freedom of others.
Data from the test removed persistent racial differences
The federal testimony from last week on the knowledge gained from mathematics was the first of the good news about the public school in Colombia.
Although the cross is far from being too high for the country's operating systems, the certification has shown greater progress in the fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in the cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Certificate Centre for Progress in the Study are the enduring differences in acquired knowledge between Africans and white students, both locally and on the national page.
In the last two years, the average result of the white branches of the fourth class of Colombia has increased from 267 to 270 points (as many as 500), but in their African species, only three points, from 209 to 212.
The difference in the knowledge gained has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 points 57 to 57.
Progress in the Africans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation from the statistical unfavourable one from 245 to 245.
The average result in white tears was not included in the test results because the size of the sample was not sufficiently large.
The picture in the horizon for six years is not just exciting.
The difference between the white and black branches of the fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP was held in the course of the course, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children in both groups have improved during this period, the difference in the range has increased to 58.
Some students in the class found that in the last week, the results celebrated by the secretaries Michelle A. Rhea and the elderly Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more encouraging to the white students where they had already had high results.
This would suggest that we have increased their support to the higher end of the stage, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, an uneducated group that advocates equality of education in the class.
I didn't jump up and down because of the question of two or three points, said a member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary school in Eaton.
Often critical of Mrs. Rhee's management style, Mrs. Brown pointed out that the report on the results of the test meant secondary school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the dress, and I respect it.
But it's scary that we didn't buy almost any time and energy that we needed to pay for our high school.
Ms. Rhee said that the effort of the Committee was to continue looking for better ways to address the needs of students with low results.
This afternoon, for example, some teachers are teachers in the use of new sources of reading, the Wills' reading system, aimed at students of higher-class primary schools and high-school students who have failed to manage the basics of reading in their college careers are significantly left behind by their peers.
The daily mathematics and the basis of mathematics studies into six classes, highlighting games and experiences of real life that have been achieved in the course of the former director of Clifford Janeyi, can be found at the NAEP step-by-step, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and do the best of the students who remain under the rank, said Mrs. Rhee.
Others pointed out that the results of NAEP explained the question whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide further money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It is a certain prized dilemma for Mrs. Michel Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of studies at the California University in Berkeley where he studies the results of tests in the urban areas.
The conventional adjustment procedure is to focus on media and administrative reforms at schools located in the worst parts of Colombia.
Thus, the aim can be to produce political appeals that are directed against an important agency.
But the outcome also belongs to other city leaders who try to maintain the average distance between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of major schools.
We need to use the presence of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can agree that their children will be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now head of the school in Newark, pointed out in the interview this week that the fundamental first reduction in the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in order to achieve the school's degree.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his class teacher Loni for a school year in 185 days, making it "a commitment" to look for an increase in the next year.
Make higher education a part of a better future
The bus was headed to the Gettysburg Railway with a loud rehearsal.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, was born and at the moment started on white boots, city fascists, and smurf green trouts..
Graciellini's parents were in high school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the bottom of the road.
Now she and the other eight classes in the group studied Gettysburg, where school did $38690 a year, their status was more than a fear of visiting potential students.
Yes, that's it! she chose Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader offered them to enter the building of science.
Sir, really? the rules of thought when they were created by a low level of teachers to the students.
The Pennsylvania train was one of the seven who visited their class trip and were now fully occupied with the future report: The question is, do you enter the train?
The question is where.
However, there is a pressing problem with the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from high schools or children as unaccompanied, but statistics exist for those who receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, the fifth of this "second generation" of Spanish jaguars from the streets - amazingly achieved results suggest that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and middle American citizens, have reached the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers point out, because it supports their point of road ahead of the generation that played a crucial role in the field of the labour force of the country.
Those who achieved high school education say that they had a natural skill at school and a natural skill and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to compensate for the lack of knowledge of American schools.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children, who would like to pursue a course - especially if these efforts are in the meantime.
If we note that children are coming from a low income group whose parents have no experience and ability to help them to focus on the system, whatever simple principles in each individual point, says Patricia Gándara, research at the California University in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American field.
We need to think about providing these children with a safe network in their pre-school age in all ways to attend high school.
The federal program that financed Graciely's trip along the way is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (appropriate), it provides more than $300 million annually for local school systems for the launch of further preparatory programmes, which are counted for students from a group with small admissions to high schools and continue until these students are completed high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of which more than % have been enrolled, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Industry of Iraq has reached agreement with 10 foreign companies
In spite of the concern about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to adopt a significant robust company to rebuild its low-cost infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
The Ten Agreement concluded the Iraqi Ministry of Industry with foreign Russian companies, which indicates that Chinese, Russian and European Russian Russian companies are ready to play a significant role in re-establishing the Iraqi steel industry, protecting the war decades and sanctions.
The American companies went with the capital's share right into two of the 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for their participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was celebrated in June.
The secret involvement of American roman giants in an open Iraqi roman industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and the place of American companies here you have in the first row on the way to Asia and Europe, said Ruba Husari, editor Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It'll be a long time before something else is sold in Iraq.
The security concerns raised by massive-coordinated bombings in the interior and political instability are likely to reflect American companies from many more intensive companies in Iraq, which have allegedly a third largest source reserve, say analysts.
In some cases, American companies have been in a state of emergency, especially Chinese and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk, because they do not correspond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the ministry.
Former American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
China National Petroleum Corp. participated in tenders on more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts in two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become the main economic power, as well as the technological force, says Assam Jihad's speech ministry.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparably competitive and reach its commitments against Iraq.
The companies which were previously selected to submit tenders were then compared to the ministry at barl prices and the ministry was willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level on each field.
The planner al-Qaedy was apparently killed in Pakistan.
In the case of an American rocket at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was evident that a spy planner of al-Qaedy was killed, as announced by the 5th official of the American Anti-Terrorist Division.
As confirmed, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets arrived on their fourth train near the city of Miran Şah in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the area.
The local authorities announced that rockets were fired from the plane without a crew of the type with which the CIA is operating in the sand of illegal marine tribes.
These were listed on a white car that was headed to the Afghan border when it was hit, he introduced the officer along with the Pakistani intelligence agency he called from Miran Shah.
The officer pointed out that the local armed forces had come to the point and quickly had fun what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victim, but two U.S. anti-terrorist authorities quoted an unnamed witness who indicated that Somalia was dead.
Somalia was identified as a highly established planner for military operations in al-Qaedy, which led the operations of a group of terrorists outside the Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in a global reconnaissance, said a senior officer who was not yet appointed, who introduced a sensitive attitude of American air force officials to Pakistan.
If he remained such a central position, he would probably have been involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the highest leadership of Al-Qaedy and planned possible terrorist attacks on their behalf.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was quickly involved in al-Qaedy hierarchies and was well connected to the other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but that he didn't let himself down in any way to meet us and our associates, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking al-Qaedy or Taliban leader who would have been killed since the same attack when the victim was killed by the Nimudin Jalolov, the leader of the military band in the village of the native tribes and three other high-peripheral leaders.
The time of attacks initiated by the CIA by pilot-free flights has been reduced from years to years from averages of about six operations per month for two months, according to Long War data, the website of the non-profit group.
The reduction may be due to the improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by, too, killing persons suspected of being informers, the website has introduced.
The High Representative of the United Nations has left Kabul.
The High Representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, announced on Friday that he would like to resign from his office in March and end such a turbulent functional period that was marked by accusations of gross corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
The Eide is leaving because Obama's administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegation noted that it supported growth, but expressed concern that the United States' timetable for reducing the state, which began in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO States to achieve their strength.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide introduced a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment received must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil servants helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The presence on the side of armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said that he didn't break up, but that he was just a full-time promise that he gave his family in March 2008 that he spent only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
General Ban Ki-moon now indicated that he would need time to find a reward.
As I said, it's the best time to look after the next one, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to U.S. officials, the OSN Ban started looking for a reward.
The officials indicated that it was decided between Stefan di Misturou, who had the Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jeanem-Maria Guéhenn, France, who had previously conducted the peace operation of the UN.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused of serving President Hamid Karzaím, who won the country presidential elections from masking the presence of massive volunteer machinery.
Eide rejected this claim, but pointed out that Galgraitha's charge -- which was released -- "was definitely damaged by the mission, because there was a high level of scepticism here with regard to international principles" at the time of the election.
Eide indicated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens for coordination of the decommissioning effort to lead the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the leadership of the UN to enable its representatives to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries who would hire them for the Afghan mission, because he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is needed properly.
Eide expressed a decrease in its efforts in Afghanistan and pointed out that the difficult UN procurement regulations undermine its ability to use capacity.
The rules of the UN are such that I had an opportunity to get from the flowers only one person, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces another penalty
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's powers will soon take over Iran "more significant sanctions" because of lack of commitment in the talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey through the areas where they fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, rejected the views of armed acts against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good vote for Iran, he said in response to the military question of possible development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I learned something from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is an inexhaustible impartiality in the war.
The Ombudsman shall decide in the case of sanctions which may affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates has indicated that some of these sanctions could also be achieved by the ordinary Iranians.
He said that "the balak of revenge and arrest" would require "to accept the Iranian government to actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons", because "its citizens will be extremely patient" with sanctions.
According to a fifth statement issued by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not introduce its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Committee and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists on developing its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed that he would provide the essential part of his frozen uranium to replace immediately the necessary fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administrative Board was established by such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to make time for the meeting.
But from that time on, Iran seems to withdraw from the provisional agreements - partly because of the fact that the Iranian leadership is divided into views on whether to engage in the United States.
It was rightly said that in the case of Iran's resistance to the international community in the case of some proposals that were actually agreed at the beginning of October, I believe that this led to the international community, including Russia and the Chinese, along the road that is not the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set the deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN decided on Thursday what it called "unresponsible and unsubmitted charges" before some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and indicated that it would like to continue in discussions with the United States and five other world powers for achieving an appropriate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before leaving to the Kurdistan area, rich on the job to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and the Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It maintains high tension between Kurdy and the Iraqi majority, especially because of restrictions, ownership and distribution of revenue.
Gtes focused on both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent the maintenance of US plans to limit the number of American soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to relieve Kurd's anxiety from persistent depression. Officially, the United States quoted Gates as sending Massoud Barzaan, President of Kurdistan Regional Government, saying: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to let you go."
In ancient China, changing the course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propagandaistic complaints that they read that "The Mother of the Earth is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "One child more means one grave more."
Then they learned that when official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by low fertility and ageing the population in their town, the course changed in this year and began to encourage young couples, their reactions were immediate and decided: Never.
We've always spent all our time and energy on just one child.
We left nothing for the second one, says 31-year-old Wang, human resources manager who has eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years of policy China has only one child was introduced and has created two generations only of nonorthodox and obese children, infected by the “small censorship”, the country threatens the population crisis.
The average fertility fell to 1.8 children in pairs compared to six before the policy entered into force, according to the UN data.
The distribution of population, where the population is aged 60 years and above, is expected to rise from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of around 20 per cent.
The gap is greater in the rich coastal cities with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Loni people aged 60 and above created about 22 percent of registered citizens in Shanghai, while births were less than one child in pairs.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help to reduce the proportions of the elderly and reduce the number of working forces in the future".
He says it's "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Progressive reconciliation
As put into the Constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably today the most controversial mandate of the Communist Party.
The two who violated the policy led to an inconsistencies -- up to a quarter of their annual wage in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official places have been promoting a policy that has helped the country to prevent the critical freezing of natural resources while human rights defenders have been rejected when policy-making is being sought.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to give birth to their second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo seismic electoral defeats, leading to an unprejudiced high level of men against women.
In recent years, public officials have been progressively more peaceful in their attitude toward the politics of one child.
In 2004, the rule allowed for an exception - including the citizens of the city, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were single -- and in 2007 the thickets of their hair, which crossed the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the People's Research Institute of Beijing University, said that the central government officials had already discussed radical changes, such as enabling couples to have two children, if one of the partners was a single partner.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign for the promotion of more offspring.
About midnight, payments were made by parents to have only one child, copied by copies of the regulation, described in detail how to have another child and how to ask for permission.
The city administration sent officers for family planning and volunteers to meet with money in their homes and put the planes under the door.
They also promised to provide citizenship and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, the family planning officers indicated.
The closing response
Even though officials in one foreign town around Shanghai reported increased interest in two children who wanted to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the city's districts did not report changes.
The city district of Huianan with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
The complainants in Shanghai indicated that the number of people born in the city in 2010 was only about 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee in Shanghai, Caolu pointed out that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to give it to the best of the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she'd like to have two children and have been legally allowed.
But like many Chinese who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a high-end network, the call could be unresponsible.
People in the West view the policy of one child as a bad legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in a relationship with the first child.
Yes, we were pleased to have more than one child.
But the problem is nothing but politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point out psychological reasons for behavior.
Wang, the manager of human resources, says that they want only one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of our family's attention and we were all worried about us.
We weren't used to providing care, and we didn't really want to worry about each other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who is a government translator company, expressed it much more indiscriminately.
For two-year-olds from middle-aged classes who have reduced their fertility, he said success is meant to be selfish.
Today’s 20th and 30th years are viewed by parents as the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and they do not want this way of living for themselves, she says.
It's just one child who makes enormous demands at the time of parents, she says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions in the area -- "You have to stop your stay" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have summary prepared in time when the child is 9 months for good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to make peace with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group has set up an emission reduction plan.
The UN's follow-up conference on climate -- characterized by far-reaching non-existences and mutual identification -- once again focused on the release of a document, which proposes the ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations, most of which are not in the most vulnerable in the near future.
The text that can provide the outcome of the final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions highlights the remaining obstacles as it explains the road ahead.
But it was seen that important progress was seen in the meetings that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodan next week.
Created by the OSN working group ad hoc, this text does not necessarily indicate how much money the rich country should provide to those poor to arrange with a global short-term and long-term heating.
And it provides a full range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon emissions and what should be a high limit to the growth of global temperatures, which policy makers will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a high dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Washington Club of Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-star document, a summary of 180 pages of the text from the meeting to focus on what the Spit official on climate issues at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as "a big picture".
It sets out the estimates for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent per year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union quickly concluded on Friday that it would provide $3.6 billion over the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to climate change -- from the management of floods and droughts to the prevention of pollution.
But on Friday, however, he introduced these types of verbatim fires that were carried out during the discussions last week.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern has forgotten a saying requiring binding restrictions on the emissions of greenhouse gases for industrial countries compared with the voluntaryness of the major developing economies, if not funded by the developed world.
Posun signaled that Obama's administration had reached a tough line against China without Bush's officials just two years ago.
The United States does not enter into a contract without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of the action, said Stern, who also felt that the text was not sufficient to ensure limitations and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei told the US prime minister about climate issues that whether there is a lack of "serious understanding" or "immortal non-responsibility" had led to a week ago to a statement that the United States would not help financially China to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic forces of the world's major forces in the closet, the halls have fallen within the developing world, both between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current war is mostly about the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States as regards the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while the poorest nations warn that two tenths of the world's most affected countries ignore the scientific imperatives of more thorough action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegation, said that it is not surprising that the main forces are fighting who should have incurred costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in looking for ways to prevent large issuers from taking responsibility for their actions.
It is a clear game of the development of new economic hegemony, Ulate said that it also serves as a regional council in the region of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature.
Some countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would want to continue to implement legally binding agreements in Kodana, most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be the political agreement.
Alliance of small island States with 43 members created a 24-star proposal of the agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Mitzger, who led the international climate meeting in favour of the European Commission, said that the transition from small island nations "recalls political pressure on the whole policy process" partly because they are now united and demand actions from growing economies, such as China and India.
The meeting created a new momentum, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining disputes before the Heads of Government reached agreement.
High positions of officials, such as the Indian Minister for Environmental Protection Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of Environment, have emerged from the plane and led the Bella centre to the closed door of meetings and new conferences, so they can take orders that will be assessed next week.
The simple scope of the assembly - when 13,000 people were transferred from and to the congress centre every day, the guitars playing active in the night focused on the ironic views of the countries they thought had sent out, and came to hand-made proposals on paper rather than electronic mail -- controlled exports.
Intensity is simply a reconstruction: in Kodana, almost all key ministers were present and in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy in the International Protection of Nature.
They're getting heavy loads.
British first train with speed 140 miles an hour ago defined this half of the feeling
at 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the storm broke on the mark of the train's departure, which marked the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed personal train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and flight from Ashford to Kent in the London St Pancras and passes a distance of 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Ms. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal traffic outside lLndyn.
It is hoped that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, flexible trains and connect the great aglomeration of Midland, north and Scotland with London.
The above-mentioned waters should take up transport time in personal transport and on commercial routes and the passage from aircraft and cars to railways to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate barriers on the roads.
Theoretically, three main political parties were allowed to get this vision.
But the tens of billions of blocs needed to build a new national railway network, an inevitable battle on projects and concerns about environmental degradation have now brought about the construction of British high-speed roads.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a realistic study, has delivered his report to Lord Adonos for 30 seconds, as Times said.
She gave him a detailed map of another planned high-speed network.
The new link between London and the West Midland was designed to be five metres in urban areas and fours where the addition to the environment could be a problem.
In the open country, the final track was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also proposes to specify three options for a wide high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer the call.
The preferred call is the distortion of the form of Y letters, when one high speed track should lead to the western Middle East.
The tract should take place near Birmingham with one wind passing from Pennsylvania to Manchester and Scotland and another leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One trail should take you to Scotland.
"It looks like it's come to the most powerful choice," said the trainer.
As soon as this is done, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced by two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow the travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should enable trains to drive 2250 miles an hour, which would make from the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is already designed to unload trains in 400 m , which would be capable of transporting 1100 persons.
Up to 18 teams could operate every hour on London-Birmingham track.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to serve up to 20000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be extended to cover the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offers such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if the car is moving, the network should be built in part.
Trains should be introduced first, not on high speed routes, but on existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain the travel times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is awarded as a starting point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the revolution on the railway.
Taxable taxpayers purchased mortgages in excess of 75000 pounds on Tory's orange
Alan Duncan was held by the previous headquarters of Tory's in the parliamentary chamber to pay thousands of free of charge for the last year for the orange that he had built in his own house in a volunteer service.
a speech party behind the prison, who was degraded by David Cameron because he insisted that the messengers live "out of doors," increased his mortgage to 75000 pounds to build a deep space in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for a particular interest, a total of free per month for tax collectors.
The current authorities accepted orders at the time and thus was not heard by Sir Thomassen Legge, who had taken control of the Member States' expenditure. Last night Mr. Duncan expressed his demands "it may be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two double houses for everyone in his volunteer professions Rutland and Melton.
Homes have a value of about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, living room and food, but the financial authority agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the home of the winter garden, which is marked in the plans as "oranjerie".
Neighbors describe it as a "for fun and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increased loan during the last control of the committee for the current standards and privileges in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The Committee sent him a month ago that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the populace security to a mortgage of 271406 free from his estate in London at his own house, which he bought in 1991, the year before he became a member of the parliamentary parliament.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan charged approximately 1,400 pounds a month in favor of the mortgage until March of last year.
In depth, his orders increased to over 1800 pounds per month.
The interest rate of RBS in Mr. Duncan's mortgage could not be changed at this time, which means that it was all intended to finance the loan of 75000 pounds.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payments decreased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in the spring of this year, where it remained.
The latest document by the public authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to charge 1250 pounds per month in May.
Mr. Duncan gave up his job as a stone manager of the House in September after one of her secretaries filmed and said that the envoys must survive "on the floor" after the scandal with expenditure.
"In principle, it's natural, you have to live on the floor and it's going to be with you as with the s**t."
He said, "I have lost my money for my garden and a fine and a small share of what I needed.
And I could steal the whole damn part, but I can't do it."
The messenger, a million of his former career as a rope dealer, was first invited to explain his issue in May when it was shown that he hired thousands of free for his prize, even before the approval of the financial authority, that "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists buried me under the label of the librarian in Mr. Duncan's lawyer for a protest after he retired that he owed 4,000 pounds for a period of three years.
When he was asked to raise the mortgage last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was due to the increase in capital, which was approved as the financial authority, then Leggem."
He added: "This is not a controversial question of hiding and calling or breaking rules or something else.
It's absolutely equal to the shadow down, according to the rules, right and that's all.
It would not be necessary in many other ways to be cleaner or simpler."
Come and watch the chat on the bright side with the Advent calendar.
Coastal chats in Brighton have found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the church’s creative enjoyment, invited 24 owners to open their chats every day in the Sundays, and to use the Christmas halls as the theme of this exhibition.
The event started on 1 December when it enabled visitors to watch the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 a day, and the biscuits and broken wines provided free.
The selected channels included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas, when the chat presented the work of Janety Tozer, local artists.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the Chichester diocese and leading Beyondu.
He said: "We want to make worship much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we have to expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an exciting way.
"The idea of an Advent calendar in chats became just as a conversation with some friends during the evening.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we tried to try and present that spiritual path."
Strong mobilization in Kodan and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the street on Saturday asking for a decent and binding agreement against global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, demonstrated around the world and in Kodana, where the police arrested hundreds of people on this occasion.
At least three thousand people, according to police sources and hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, showed themselves in the cold time in the Danish capital at the time of the UN climate conference, with the aim of adopting a fifth agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Conference on Climate, stated that the growing global mobilization, with its clear evidence being a contemporary manifestation, contributed to the "political tax" of any success in Kodan.
According to the AFP journalist, the incident in the Danish capital soon followed the beginning of the process when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break down the scenes with long-distance costumes and clubs.
The order police were right on the spot.
The whole police announced 600 to 700 arrests and stressed that it was particularly about the members of the Blacks Blocks, of the ultra-radiated private groups that had already appeared in depth at NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Coalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, decided the conditions for which hundreds of radicals were closed "without distinction" and highlighted that about a hundred of them were in the storm and in the seat "held in the streets still on Saturday evening" and over extreme winter.
After the release of Parliament, the tour was smoothed to the Bella Center, where the meeting was held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
For speakers, a podium was set up before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protestors received buses and trains from large European cities and other than Africans here were also large numbers of Asian participants, including some Chinese and Korean.
About 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue beaches, created the first meeting in Kodana in the afternoon, calling on a group of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create a "moral wave" for "righteous climate".
Today, we are going to the street to ask for a balance of environmental debt in the south, explains Lidi Nacpilov, the Philippines's South Coalition General in Kodani.
We can't say that it's time for this to happen, the Beninan singer Angelique Kidjo's.
In Africa, rivers and rivers flow, we can go through them today, and it was never possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 after the adoption of the UN Treaty, the famine was approaching the environmental organizations of the world.
The French MEP José Bové, one of the members of the struggle for another world, said that he came to Kodan with the aim of "producing climate and social justice". "At the present time, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the struggle for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the street by organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, were dressed in red clothes and with the rising importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators have gone to the street with a demand for a decent response to climate change.
In France, the protests organized by "350" were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseilles (theirs), Lille (the north), Bordeaux (the west) and Lyon (the east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen its president, Georgia rejects it as "frequency"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi is reporting this step for "fresque".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Russian war in August 2008 on control over South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory known by Russia.
The volunteers closed at 17 hours of GMT.
According to officials, the Abkhaz Volunteer Commission participated a few hours before the closure of the polling stations was 58%.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night.
All five candidates, including President Sergeie Bagapša, have categorically rejected the opinion of the hearing with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These wills are a fresco.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakašvili "is flying that Abkhazia has all fallen to the Russian government," said his speaker, Mana Mana Manjgalze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this country of 216,000 residents was recognized only by Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian army.
After division from Georgia, after the conflict in the years 1992-1993, when thousands of people were missing, Abkhazia is trying to show through the election that it is ready to return to international policy.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said AFP Quarčia Svetlan, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to vote for President Bagapše.
She was one of those who came to volunteer at the school in the capital of Suchumi, to a beautiful white building with several palm trees in the entrance.
The question of the Russian authorities is the main issue of presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can be brought to an austerity.
All over this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, the large billboards with Bagapsze were located with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimimira Putina.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the Russian officials, who came to see the wonderful time of the election, were waiting for a warm reception from Beslan Arschby’s regular age.
"We, Abkhaz, are grateful," he said in a small order, with a view to supporting Moscow and in particular her decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the Organization of the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski said, a member of the Russian parliament, and joined this leadership.
The opposition represented in the elections by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimbo and two traders Zausz Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutbou criticised the contracts concluded in the last year with Moscow, such as a contract allowing Russia to control the Abkhazia railway network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support neither the current government nor opposition.
To win in the elections, a half majority of 50% plus one vote is required.
If none of the candidates fail to reach this result, the winning file must be delivered in two weeks.
Climate: world events, events in Kodana
Tens of thousands of people went to the street on Saturday asking for a decent and binding agreement against global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, was demonstrated worldwide and in Kodana, where about 700 people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least three thousand people, according to police sources and hundreds of thousands by organizers, have been shown in the cold season in the Danish capital, which will host up to 18 December 193 delegates from the countries concerned with an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After the release of Parliament, the tour was smoothed to the Bella Center, where the meeting was held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
For speakers, a podium was set up before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the Cape Town of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, the incident soon followed the departure of a group of several demonstrators, dressed in black and armed clocks and clubs, began to break out.
The order police just locked up and locked up without waiting, and several demonstrators hit the ground.
The whole police announced 600 to 700 arrests and stressed that it was particularly about the members of the Blacks Blocks, of the ultraradial independent groups that had already appeared in depth at NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Last afternoon, one police officer was injured on the sidewalk and four cars were burned near the corner of an incident near the police station, which resulted in about 20 people being detained.
We're focusing on the extremismist group, protecting the speech police Henrik Jacobsen, while the guards again flew into the air.
Most of the protestors who received a bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were European origins.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean or African.
About 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue beaches, created in the afternoons of Kodana the first meeting on the call of a group of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create a "moral wave" for "righteous climate".
Today, we are going to the street to ask for a balance of environmental debt in the south, explains Lidi Nacpilov, the Philippines's South Coalition General in Kodani.
We can't say that it's time for this to happen, the Beninan singer Angelique Kidjo's.
In Africa, rivers and rivers flow, we can go through them today, and it was never possible before.

The French MEP José Bové, one of the members of the struggle for another world, said that he came to Kodan with the aim of "producing climate and social justice". "At the present time, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the struggle for another world".
Oxfam's organization has called for a number of famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen, or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the tax.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, in which many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the street by organizers.
In Manila, there were hundreds of people, mostly students, in red clothes, before the capital city of the Philippines, and with scenes of the rising importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakart, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for a substantial response to climate change.
In France, the protests organized by "350" were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseilles (theirs), Lille (the north), Bordeaux (the west) and Lyon (the east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of the map and newspaper will be strengthened in the context of the reform of the general population, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, pointed out during the Sunday talk for JDD magazine that the subjects will be in the framework of the reform of the general "skilled", although their research will no longer be based on accurate knowledge in the last year.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week, and for all, the same program from public culture will be confirmed by Chattel.
According to the Minister, "you have to end with cover," because, according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on accurate knowledge" but "there are basically the best students in it."
The specialisation of the EC and L cannot be for any sub-specialisations, it continues and emphasizes: "I have heard many stories and intellectuals who would argue that in the last year of professional gymnasiums, the country will not learn the story and the story."
A study by the Ifop agency, which published the Humanities newspaper on Saturday, showed that seven of the 10 French (69%) disagree with the government project to abolish the compulsory education of children and the country in the maternity year with specialization S, and that is why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this cancellation as both the left and some legal messengers.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "he does not take into account" to eliminate philosophy in the specialization programme of the master journal.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in the education of students, while 16 organisations (students and committees) called for participation in the field mobilization against this project, which they call for the teaching of future professors of gymnasiums.
The Minister explained that during the Magisterial Study 2 (M2), at the beginning of the annual trial, a further test was aimed at their teams and at the end of the year verifying their ability to study.
The participants will attend the second year of the Master's study, and the first year will be presented as a professor-student.
If you count all the states that will be offered to you before the adoption procedure, you will gain more experience with complaints, about 300 hours, continue .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which is still not available in national education.
He reaffirmed the project for the destruction of the school folder by 2012.
At the elite university of École, normal superiors have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes for the presentation of the objectives of the Kodak Summit: this is the challenge announced in the conference in the morning by Jean Jouzel, a multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) on the establishment of the University of Ecole normal Superiors on the Ulm Street.
As reported by one AFP journalist, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conference, which is a one-time seminar composed of fifteen-minute experts who will be targeted and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would affect people and, on the basis of what they would like to know more, explained at the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which received the name of the local lake fish, which students called it.
He selected about two dozen accompanying experts from individual scientific disciplines and stressed that the choice was based on their charisma.
About climate warming "we can talk about hours, but we can also keep the basic goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before a dozen audiences without a prepared note, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he highlighted with hope that the audience knew that "the Kodańsk conference is about a very serious scientific basis".
The video set on these presentations will be posted on the website of schools since December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is planned on the site and will be followed by the regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: breach of surveillance in prisons, planned measures
The Committees of Prison Monitors announced on Friday "general mobilization" because they requested that they be awarded the prizes and the periods for which the award was suspended on ice for financial reasons.
The Federal FO (2nd Board of Supervisors) requested employees who would not have the service to participate in demonstrations in the morning before the prison facilities and to "block" them and so warn of "the theft of their bodies".
CGT for a prison guard (3rd Committees of this sector) called for "calling together in individual prisons and starting basic mobilization" with "study and unfriendly", "times and allowances for work in the night, on Sundays and on holidays" not being paid in the afternoon.
The First Committee of the Observers, the Federal Union of Prison Observers (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for total mobilization (...) with a view to expressing discontent and disillusionment".
The Management Board and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of periods increased significantly in 2009 and not all were included in the financial statements, but ensure that the debt amounts will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Office announced that Michele Alliot-Mario had sent the Committees of Prison Guards a communication to ensure that the payment will be made next month.
I know of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes in their communication.
I have ordered the Prison Management Board to take immediate measures to add to the Minister of Alliot-Mari to the situation that has resulted in a poor assessment of the number of periods in the future, which has never been repeated in the future.
The Prosinc will therefore be lower, with the exception of the managers who receive a famous award for the performance of the function and the fulfilment of the objectives, Ufap/Uns states, and for those who "will always find a place in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the FO Interregional Union in Marseille broke down and announced its decision to fight against calling "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays if they will not be paid for these holidays in October, as in the meantime, they are also threatened by FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
In the meantime, when we're given more work and more jobs without the availability of other staff, it's sad to allow them to pay you the lowest level of employees, the CGT-Venice Surveys in Bordeaux.
According to the Committee, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case, the financial resources were small because the general secretary-general of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, was found.
Both claim that at Christmas he's giving "better gifts" than those he gets.
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first wedding with his family in the White House, concluded that Oprah Winfrey's "warming" drawings about gifts have a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the order that will be sent on Sunday evenings to the ABC station about how they are going to spend the holidays and at the end of the year in their new and prestigious housing.
Even Bo, a small four - year - old family member will have his own advantage.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama with the fact that the dog will also get a "of course" gift as it comes from the results of the pre-ordering order.
And Michelle Obama also stood against her husband's claims on the quality of gifts that she gets: "That's certainly not the case, I gave you Loni a gift," the president lamented.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after the humor, he showed his finger on the hairdresser first lady, "And who gave you this?"
During this one year's very relaxed order with the famous moderator, who actively supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, he also talked to Obama's wives about their favorite gifts, which they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a 10-step transporter, but also a basketball ball that he wore at his father's wedding, with which he met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father, who came to see us at the wedding and how he gave me the basketball match, the president told me.
A long time later, I realized that the sword actually gave me it.
The first lady mentioned the house for the panties again.
I didn't even know how to organize it all in the house, so I fixed all the furniture on the wall instead of putting it around the bed, but I loved the little house for the ladies, remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-examined, RTL says she's in an artificial bed
Johnny Hallyday was re-examined in Los Angeles because of the "infection" resulting from more operations in France, but the situation is based on his closest "control", while the RTL station indicated that the song is in an artificial bed to prevent disease and complications.
66th-year-old rocker was re-examined on Wednesday Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "the injury resulting from the operation" of the ignition plane that he passed in Paris on 26 November, he sent his print department to Paris, asking for "the correct operation".
However, the press section tried to calm the public and pointed out that the situation was "under control" and also announced that a new medical communication would be issued no later than 48 hours later.
According to the RTL station, which is the main music partner of the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was introduced to an artificial bed to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little more confidence, it'll add RTL.
The press division, on the AFP question, did not confirm this information or comment.
The RTL also states that according to "some sources" there was no drone in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was charged at the Parc Monceau International Clinic because of an explosion.
The surgery that was planned a few days ago was performed by neurosurgery Stefan Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artistic circles.
But the doctor wasn't available on Thursday for RTL information.
After this operation, Johnny Hallyday's song was hospitalized in the hospital of Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles for infection that occurred after the pregnancy.
A song by Eddie Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on Thursday in the RTL, that his friend is just going through "a bad time", but he added that he's "not old enough" because it's a big "warman".
He phoned me quietly before the flight to Los Angeles, but I told him he's doing crazy because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, Eddie Mitchell said.
In the middle of the evening, he calmed the situation of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics", and that the infection was "stop".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, his wife's singer, and that he didn't notice any special concerns.
Health problems only occur when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell to his stomach.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, it was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was on a "little tanker" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, he returned to his long tour of "Tower 66", presented as his divisor.
But since then each of his health problems has been closely monitored and commented. Fanous and journalists have noticed that singing has a problem with movement on the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to decompose a new hospitalization report again.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Francouz Frédérick Bousquet, a three-dimensional medalist on the world's mysteries in 2009 in a large pool, won the title of the 2009 European Mission in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline that is particularly popular: 50m free.
The first day of the mystery, on which the last allowed combinations, were only three world records, although they were expected much more.
One of them crossed the Hungarian race by Evelyn Verrastov on 200 m side race and two left men's staff in Russia on 4x50 m side race.
A large castle for Bousqueta, which was built on the world record in 50 m free way, which is already held in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal disciplines, 50m free route, Francouz won 28 years of age at the end of 20,53 seconds in the final, where the primer started ten sailors instead of normal eight.
Bousquet translated the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesik's (20.84), but did not translate the world record (20.30) as predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all ships had combinations made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
From February 2008 to the 238 World Records and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first to be held in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of combinations this time did not even help the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double master of the world in a large pool in the summer in Rome, which had a world record for the reach of hands.
The young sailor failed to overcome the record that holds 400 metres free way (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian runner Nikitou Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Madsem Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't do everything to that race.
I knew I didn't break the world record this time, but I was able to celebrate my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent of the future, explained Biedermann.
U.S.: The table of the Roman sarcopha equivalent to Zolov was sold for $1.5 million
The album of the Roman sarcophas, which did not belong to anyone other than French writer Emil Zolovi, was issued on Thursday at $1.5 million, which is significantly more than was claimed, said a trader with the art of Sotheby ¿s.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high, starting from the third century of our flight, amounted to $150,000 to $250,000.
Mramor "presenting four dionysov scenes in the advanced architectural decours, surrounded satyrs and bachanties is a remarkable part, similar to the world is very small, about four or five," AFP said in the interior of Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of old Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The deal was sold among the hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it's the subject that was most likely to be approached by the AFP language agency Sotheby's Dan Abernetthy.
The fact that Emile Zola managed this nightmare was discovered a few days ago.
The Deska was in Rome for almost 300 years in the late Borgia family collection, and then gradually appeared in the French hierarchy of Cecile Sorelov, who had spent time with her at her private hotel in Paris and at Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly the President of the Council prior to the entry into force of Petaina.
It's been in there for about a dozen years.
Florent Heintz found in the search for a museum database in Louvru that this desk was part of the "Emira Zoly's remains" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Missed attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
On Thursday, Mexico claimed that the conditions for the transfer of the frozen President of Honduras, Manuela Zelaya, who refused to provide a safe exit guarantee were not met.
After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelayau last night, she still insists that there is no way to achieve this transport, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos.
The Mexican government aircraft which flew to Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya re-arrived, introduced the source of the general migration management.
The clean-up government wanted to send President Zelay to "demissions" and to ask for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with a safe exit.
But the President-in-Office rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of the state.
The government of the Puritans "have experienced further failures when it wanted me to give up my functions (...), they wanted me to resign," said Zelaya Radio Globo, on Thursday, often expressing himself to a political crisis that lasts for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, I've added a constable president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpé for two and a half months, and I've been playing a couple of accords.
Mexico's Enlargement asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, because it does not contain asylum application, said the Minister of the Interior, Oscar Raul Matute Honduran Radio HRN.
I'm not going to ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in a conversation about Telesur station, which has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll go as President of the Honduran people, I'll see him.
The reports on the departure of Zelai were mobilized in the middle of the position of the conscript president, who came to gather around Brazil's capital city, where the army had promoted protection.
Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the position of the populist government.
They show their marginal position to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was sentenced on 28 June, on the day when he was re-elected in preparation for his re-election of public consultation, against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
He returned from exile in Costa Rica unexpectedly on 21 September and found a shelter in the Brazilian capital.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and he'll be responsible for the crime of the "stars" he's accused of, the government's claims.
On 29 November, President Roberto Micheletti was able to organize presidential elections to replace President Zelayi.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States, but condemned countries of Latin America as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil won Porfirio Lobo.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power, until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street boasts, commercial balance USA offers optimism
The New York bridge ended on Thursday, and the results of the American trade balance testify to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones received 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final conclusions, Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination from 7,13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 has improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from various parts of the economy, comments Lindsey Piegzva from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focusing on "a half of the full conclusion".
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus mainly on the number of US trade balance, "which shows that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. business balance is estimated at 7.6% in October, at $32.9 billion.
Instead, the analysts expected the scale to grow.
There's been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing trade volume, particularly the export of goods, which reflects the growth of the economy of the main trading partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States, the last week has grown against all expectations of unemployment and the number of employers has reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new employers was "at least this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
He's got a piece of valuable paper, too.
The rate of State spending with a view to 10 years increased by 3,482% sales by 3,423% on Tuesday night and the amount of 30 flights increased by 4,492% sales by 4,408% day before.
Cuba : hundreds of residents of the regime wrote "Damas in White"
Several hundreds of Cuban regime residents wrote on the fourth day of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and stopped other demonstrations where dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About four "Dam in White", a husband or a close political prisoner was posted directly on the street of the rest of Raula Castra regime on their way to the city centre with a request for political prisoners to be released, the journalist informed.
Go away with Yankees!, "Golds!", "The Street belongs to revolutionists!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were shocked by the double-six stops of the regime on dissidents.
In the end, the dissidents were escorted to civilians who accepted "safety."
The day before, there was a similar manifestation against "I'm in white," but there was no harm or arrest.
However, in the Havan IV, Vedado was detained by police officers in the civilian area, about ten dissidents who also wanted to manifest themselves on Thursday, on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights, informed the AFP journalist.
According to this journalist, the police put in place dissidents who were fired from the government regime into civilian vehicles for use of force.
Detention of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rules.
Sacharov's prices for the European Parliament for 2005, "The White Ladys" organized an unauthorized move for "freedom of everyone, according to a decade, about 200 political prisoners", introduced one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind the networks.
The Cuban authorities consider the responses to the "guarantee" or "agents" paid by their main enemies, the United States.
A complete show, Cuban television brought a report on the fourth demonstration of the government's regime's supporters against "responsives of the revolution".
The Cuba with the Communist Party in the Heads of State and the Government's policy is regularly charged by European or American non-governmental organizations with non-compliance with human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
The knifeman killed an eight-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
He killed an 18-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during the raid on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, a 28-year-old attacker reportedly attacked two knifes and, for some reason, an eight-year-old man in or before her, 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, a version of the police and witnesses.
A seriously injured old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police union in the hospital for the consequences of his injury.
In this medicine or before, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
His wife was three and a half years old, and he was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which a man died eight years ago.
The life of the second injured is in danger, according to police sources, it is evident that vital organs have been infected.
A pregnant woman then broke up and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," said a police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as he introduced the police source, then fled to the street, still at Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He hurt two other people, apparently a coincidence: a thirty-four-year-old man, that's the second serious one.
It's not quite clear how it happened, because it's been played in the evening hours.
He was armed with two handguns that I didn't cross the back, said at the location of the Alliance's leading syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Presse.
Several teenagers, including young people, have tried to stop and recover, according to the AFP-convened testimony.
I saw a 30-year-old boy in a green building.
Three young men tried to catch him.
It didn't happen to them because he was quite strong, commented on the situation of Alberto, a reader from a nearby bar.
He got paid, including one of the city police, who then broke down the strike.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two police cities, including their commanders, tried to keep the armed man and have been injured by the guns, introduced a police source.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
I've been told by my colleagues that an injured person is outside.
I went out and saw a seven-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big wound on the bridge, sent AFP Frederic Allione, a thirty-year-old doctor.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-three-year-old, who also had a foot wound.
A man who didn't have evidence of identity was arrested by a state police officer.
The State representative in Nanterre presented the investigation to the National Police Department at Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in trouble, waiting for a hearing.
The police source did not determine his location in a psychiatric treatment.
Another police source indicated that six police officers needed his control at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "all except himself" as "all the madnesss of this type whose strength in action is increasing tenfold."
USA: Poland's lawyer again asks for the end of the criminal proceedings
The Polish-French director Romana Polanski again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, the West of the United States, to stop the criminal proceedings against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of the sea fair that came to him 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the director of the film "Pianista" criticised before the three judges of the appeal court of the second period in California, a serious error that occurred during the court's transition in 1977.
I'm asking to stop moving now and then, Mr. Hummel, and he added that from the conduct of the judge who had discussed the matter, Laurence Rittenband "had a hatred in the background".
According to him, the judge (who had already died between that time) had allegedly met with a state representative who told him that Roman Poland deserved to go to prison – which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information on this conversation appeared in the document "Roman Poland: wanted and dissired" (Roman Poland, sought and requested), from the mouth of the national representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally announced to the end that "false" author's document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Judge Hummel will require a court order to be executed, in which he will be able to submit evidence of his claim.
The complainant repeated what had already been said in the first state, although he did not come to any serious study of the application for the suspension of criminal proceedings until Roman Poland was brought before the court.
76th-year-old director graduated from the United States in 1978, before the court issued a judgment on the subject of "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a young girl at the age of 13.
Since then, he has never entered the territory of the United States again.
The prosecutor in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to take part in a court settlement".
We want to show in this case not only Roman Poland, but also the other suspects that it is possible to escape? Mrs. Asayam is asking.
It is the view that the director "needs mercy in court and at the same time defeats his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to make a decision also emphasized that "there are also other options for singleness".
Lawyer Hummel was not the only one who asked for the ban on Roman Polanski's criminal activity.
The legal prosecution of the victim, Samantha Geomer's request also for the end of the criminal proceedings.
She pointed out that her client continued to bear this eternal burden every time Poland's case arises and added: "No one in this room can say that the trial was just."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland at US command
More than two months later, he was released into his home prison in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a demonstration.
Wall Street ends without direction. He's running out of dollar.
The New York bridge ended on Friday without direction, the market disappears among indicators that are better than expected in the US and rising dollar price: Dow Jones got +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final conclusions, Dow Jones Industrial Average continued from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination leaving 0.55 points and ending to 2,190.31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, introduced Mac Blacksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a difficult solution, the volume of trade has decreased greatly, and I think it will remain until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve market governance in terms of stability of economic recovery," an analysis by Charles Schwab.
In the United States, the retail market grew by 1.3% in November, and it was already a second month after itself and much more than expected.
According to the pre-school index from the University of Michigan, the American consumer confidence has also returned and increased to 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indexes were distorted by a new increase in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down the sector sensitive to the economic situation," Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank said.
Technology acts are thus losing ground under foot.
A piece of precious paper was sealed.
The rate of government savings in 10 years increased by 3,540% to 3,482% on average at night and by 30 years to 4,497% to 4,492% per day.
Volba Miss World again in the South African Republic.
After a month's journey towards the Republic of South Africa, 112 candidates on the title of Miss World are going to cross the goal of reaching their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world before the billionth television shows.
This great celebration of beauty had already taken place in the vicinity of Johannesburg in the second year, and five candidates were able to proceed to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki's, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo's from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratara and Yanbing Mao's from Canada were during his African residence in Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was the real faith of the event.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I have so many experiences!
A competitor in the Republic of South Africa will be sent directly from Midandu, north of Johannesburg, from 17 a.m. (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't make myself a better country where I'm going to set up a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could live it twice, convinced Miss Kseniya Sukhin's world, in the hot summer.
For young Russia, her second residence in the Republic of South Africa did not go into the spirit of reading meetings with other candidates and the new revelation of the country and its "kreains that will blow the breath".
After a month of appearances, testing, meeting with the press and the Safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopraov hopes that he will go to the steps of Priyanky Chopraov, elected in 2000, who will also participate in the Aishwarye Raio, victory from 1994, both become Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it's not just about looking.
We are sending out of our countries, and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary is brought into the spirit of music and dancing.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and of course in flowers.
The presentation will introduce the Chinese television moderator Angela Chowová, former queen of the South African Republic, Michelle McLean and Chairman of the Miss of Steve Douglas World Council.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the reality that it is difficult to solve, declared Julia Morley, President of the World's Competition Mission.
The candidates participated in Safari, visited the famous city of Soweto, this time on the street, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
The extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zumou, who gave them his hand.
For the unaccompanied president, she met Miss Sirry Leon.
The most beautiful memory remains in Cape Town (on the south-west of the country) for the World War, which will end in June 2010, which will help the country to support something more.
I could've met people I didn't even dream of.
I'm sure I'm going back to the 2010 World War, calling it Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's "very positive."
The reports about Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive" as David's son found us at his fifth flight to Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who had been hospitalized for a few days.
The reports are very positive.
It's very strong and everything's going very well, David Hallyday announced on his flight from Paris shortly after 13 hours of local time (21st hour of world time)
The son of a singer who was slow to say that "the fastest" will be delivered to the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, where Johny Hallyday was admitted in the afternoon for postoperative infections resulting from the operation of a broken mesobrat plant, which occurred on 26 November in Paris.
According to a press release, the night in Los Angeles was sung because of the "introduced into an artificial bed", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a medical doctor at Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles who had been admitted to an artificial bed. The hospital was responsible for the infection after the operation of the blasting mesobrator plant performed on 26 November in Paris.
Because of the serious damage caused by this content , the song had to be repeated on the middle of the night on Thursday .
According to AFP photographer, his wife, Laeticia, participated on Friday morning in the school performance of the French Lycao in Los Angeles, visiting their daughter Jade.
The chairman of the orthopedic surgery and traumatology department la Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he was on his way to Los Angeles.
The firm producer accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who sang on November 26th at the clinic du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles reported they were beaten, led by Mr. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus thinks Johnny Hallyday's gone too fast to Los Angeles and with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and he made sure that this trip was no problem, which really surprised me, since I had already endured twice over the mesobrator plane.
Some time ago at the RTL radio station, he indicated that the song was apparently flying after the Parisian operation without a shower, no matter what."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic circles.
He killed a couple of days before he died at a clinic in Neully-sur-Seine, where he was born at the time.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsbourg was also diagnosed with haematoma, resulting from brain bleeding.
It is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times judged in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax reasons and for fraud.
The lawyer of the medical chamber Olivier Metzner described him as "a man without a backbone", which is "regularly" called before the doctor's room, and which he can't even "recommend".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He announced that the delay was "just a good time" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation wasn't a haemorrhage, so it wasn't the introduction of the dreary necessary," he added.
The health problems of the song are growing from year to year, and in any case it seems that his next tour remains with the audience.
It is clear that the deadline for the renewal of the planned tournament on January 8th (V. Amiens, para., etc.) seems to be too close, Camus announced.
The UDF will raise the tone and call the New York Centre page so that it will not continue to use their shorts.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morina, on the possession of the remaining Giscards party with the fact that the short term should not be used in any media under the threat of criminal activity.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to join the UDF briefly with the fact that François Bayrou does not deserve to marry her cousin after he gave his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, was planning to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step has been supported by Hervé de Charetta's delegation (the former post-UMP now for the NC), which is attributed to the property of the UDF's brand because it was first allowed to register in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la ownerité industrialelle).
But on Friday evening, the UDF's committee of friends controlled by François Bayrou, who are not intended to be released, issued a formal request by the Minister and the Members to stop using the short term and to return to their property of protection under the threat of criminal activity.
In the last few days, you have raised a disturbing announcement that you are proposing to your political party + re-take the UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from Alliance Center.
Similarly, you have considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the bright website of your nest's name+Nouveau centre+, with +UDF diary+, also features signatures.
As you know, you do not have any right to use this summary, the UDF Committee explains that the NC will immediately remove all entries of the UDF name from all promotional materials including its (your) website.
At the same time, Hervé de Charrete asks "to provide the property of protection marks to legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will refer to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, the signatories will warn.
In their letter, UDF " is a full political summit in 1978 " and they recall that Mr. Morin and his friends " chose " from 2007 to create a competitive summit, as elsewhere in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The new centre does not therefore have the right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the latest UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to set up a trusted committee to host "moral and material interests" of Valérium Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charetet, the Committee continues, "if he registered a protective mark", he was not "a member of UDF for three years" but UMP.
He used an existing acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This inactivity begins to change into criminal acts, proclaims, and then ironicizes with the NC strategy: "It seems to us that as in politics, so in ordinary life, it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity with an adjective name that we do not have the right to.
The case of Liliane Bettencourts : François-Marie Banier will be bound to abuse the status of weakness.
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and decide whether he used the status of a weak eight-year-old billionaire to prepare her for part of her name, from which her daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, blames her.
Photographer (62 years), known as his famous photographers, will be close to 15 and 16 April 2010 for the abuse of the status of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which punishment is imposed in the maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000.
This Decision confirms that the process is actually being carried out in the cause, which can be identified as one of the best families in France, in which mother and daughter are attacked and fighting the control of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th Criminal Court ordered a medical examination of 87 years of Lilian Bettencourt, which should be conducted by three doctors.
The grandfather and the principal shareholders of L'Oréal always refused to submit such an investigation, not subject to the conditions offered by the State representative in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time provide an explanation as to whether Liliana Bettencourt could be found in the state of weakness and during which period.
I think she's coming in.
I'm talking to her, and after hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieiman, made a statement.
In the case of counsel, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
This is an excellent report(...). The expert indicates that with this old lady who needs protection, the manipulative (M. Banier) has confirmed.
It's been two years since the only daughter of Lilian Bettencourt began criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographers and artists who have been guilty of using the status of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a grant of billions of euros in the form of checks, a life insurance contract or images of masters.
That's why Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be a photographer who thinks he's a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court had to condemn the jurisdiction of the complaint filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the five-year case of lawyers changed in a family time of truth.
Lawyer Liliany Bettencourt submitted three letters to his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) expressing his doubts about the wife of François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier for fifteen years one to two times a day.
Ever since I got married, I've never been able to talk to François."
The State authorities in Nanterre have again observed that the arrest of the complainant is not justified, more than that in those days, the defendant’s application to initiate proceedings for the legal protection of her mother was denied.
Liliane Bettencourt's "is completely capable of participating in the court, not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for it," confirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers' rights would be expressed at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The manager's revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for economic intelligence has been excessive...
For more than ten years, it has been recalled the conduct of the management of large companies with respect to the company's access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of the fact that the employees are satisfied with the "records" of the mountain, as was previously the case when they were required to take up products that came from the ideas of the company's head.
Since the customer became the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared market access strategy to the right direction...and when the authoritarian efforts to introduce products that differ from customer preferences, they return regularly!
Passive access to employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Self-defenses in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much broader general phenomenon, which contains mostly managerial frameworks.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "needs active access and ability to predict from all parties involved" and requires employees who are fully in line with the acceptance of the authority management.
That is why we call for the managerial revolution, which aims to bring workers to the business interest centre as a client.
Relative utility of internal studies of public opinion.
Internal research of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted to the employees of Orange companies - contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
I'm sorry I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure is going back primarily to... what she's always been doing!
The fact that authority, as one of the pathology of power, has increased significantly the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most of the managers have a simple view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of high school for engineers, they have mechanical psychology interpretations.
Because of the consensus, they win the old behavior theory, which is now reborn by the U.S. neuroscientists and widely spread without increased knowledge of science and the media.
With the possibility of downloading "packages" (sic) from managers, he showed a recent investigation of the Ipsos agency on Figaro.fr websites, which only identifies managers in their mechanical management position that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobility factors.
On the contrary, the manager revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, presuming to adopt the final vision of human behavior.
It is based on the inclusion of a basic set of objectives and management practices : Commitments for employees will be possible only if they are used as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the present time, this concept motivation of employees is limited to studies Motivatively functional analysis.
These studies have shown that the values of their businesses, on the basis of a set of doxes, allow them to assess by means of a picture that tells them about the company, what it offers them to achieve their life objectives.
By identifying and measuring these mobility factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performances" and introduce their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a vital basis for the development of sound and effective economic intelligence.
I'm saying from Osla: "just war" Obama deserves praise from the right.
The U.S. law on Friday welcomed the statement that Barack Obama made earlier in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 rejected the concept of "righteous wars" against enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who were the first to vote on Obama's prices on 9 October, were present at this time to the presidential statement, including Sarah Palin's former candidate for the Vice-President in the elections in 2008.
I liked what he said, told Palin, the museum of the right Republican wing, for U.S. today, and added that she herself expressed the "sometimes" of the wars in her memories that are just going on.
The wave is, of course, the last thing the Americans would want to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to stay there, he thinks.
President Obama, who fought two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bushov, justified the sending of power on Thursday in Oslo and used a demonstration to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Next Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, agreed that the president took a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the event was really good, but he congratulated the former President of the shadow representatives, who assessed the President's earlier term of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this phenomenon as a whole historical, declared Ginger during the conversation in the "The Takeaway" series.
The former messenger, whom some consider to be a potential Republican candidate in presidential elections in 2012, was forced to see "the Left President" remind the members of the Nobel Prize Committee that they would not be free and could not surrender the price for peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former editor of George W. Bush, now editor Washington Post, Obama introduced "very American show".
Not only did he represent himself as a "world citizen" as always, but "he spoke as an American president" and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble that they didn't create themselves, and that they don't do too much to keep it," Gerson said.
Among a few minors from a range of rights are the series of Bush's summers, former speaker at the OSN John Bolton, who marked the appearance as "a simple, enthusiastic and without inspiration", as he pointed out on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, for example democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"If we fight in the cause of justice, we can easily cause the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-left press is against the president's honourable position.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to consider the awarding of Obama's peace prices as early as possible, he estimated his appearance as a "extraordinary" and even for the speaker of his famous talent.
Osla's speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in resolving conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression," said the California newspaper.
Both of them "has brought a revelation which should have been necessary," said New York Times, and the revelation marked "for simplicity and learning".
Road transporters: three maratons to the agreement that preserves the supply of supplies at Christmas.
After the three single maratons, the teams of road transporters and TLF, the only organisation of employees who remained until the end, came to the end on Friday evening to the agreement that ended the challenge to the strike and the threat that prevailed over the supply of supplies to Vánoce.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, on the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed "failure" after several events that began in the middle of the morning.
After the second night, the speakers were discussing on Friday morning, hoping that the amendment of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible.
And this is despite the fact that three employees' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) left the meeting.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meetings, which started at 11 hours to all agree and at 18 hours to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt business very much" and "the horror would be dangerous that the candles would be broken at the end of the year," Bussereau declared.
The wording of the text includes an increase of 4% in the lowest (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest (international transport).
The annual balance in minimum payments is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a lot, but it's a lot of effort, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight we will order our members not to come to the blockades, no blockades of the entertainment centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not at peace," he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF, welcomed "the legal agreement", even though it was difficult to recognise the increase in high payments due to international competition."
According to it, it will increase by EUR 170 per month to the lowest average and by EUR 100 to € 120 per to the highest.
With regard to the agreement on sound understanding and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) announced while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT), this is a "friendly compromise".
The agreement also foresees the revaluation of travel costs of up to 3% and the report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on the issue of 13 payment and modernising the collective contract.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million on corporate tax" which was the subject of the Government's amending proposal for a 2009 bill, which voted on Thursday at the National Assembly on Friday.
The government is calling for the Senate to vote in silence.
The signature allows for this agreement to be applied first to businesses which are members of this organisation, later to the whole committee, if the Ministry of Labour is expanded.
It's actually "in the shortest term," Bussereau made sure.
The whole process can only be interrupted by the lack of employees' organisations.
The FNTR organisation speaks of "bad trade" because EUR 100 million "was already offered by the sector under the compensation of part of the coal tax".
The State Secretary for Transport has led us to the urgent meeting of nothing due to mutual analysis, but so that he would not expose the victims of the massacres in the time of the nearby Christmas celebrations, he was suffering from Unostra.
For the Otre organisation, the agreement is threatening to "cover a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises from the area" in the next 12 months.
Direct train RER A: a stop of transport on the weekend, unsatisfied by the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of transport on the lines of the RER A direct trains, which is the largest link to the city's mass transport in France, will continue during the weekend because the fifth meeting between the committees and the conduct of the RATP the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the claim for a premium.
In Saturday and Sunday, then, on the day of the important shopping week before Christmas, trains will only drive between 10 a.m. and 20 p.m., on the main train (between La Defence and Nation) every second train, except that train only one train from four.
The SNCF proposal will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and the passengers will be forced to move on another train.
The Galeries Lafayette business houses, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, have highlighted the fact that "RATP has tried to secure connections with large business houses".
Linka RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The order ordered by RATP leads from Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday there was a train with two and practically no traffic at all except the plane as planned.
As in the fourth quarter, the people of Ile de France had arranged another and did not have any control over the estates.
So early in the morning, there was much less people than usual in the station Saint-German-en-Laye (Yvelles) than because of the lack of tears and students.
Jack Nkina, engineer, 29 years old from the Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was raised "from an hour and a half ago to make sure he's coming in time".
The Sant-Lazare airport was not filled, reported the SNCF State Railway, and the number of passengers and officers of the order was expected to increase.
Direct train RER A carried out by SNCF in direction from or to the Cergy-Le-Haut or from Saint-Lazare airport with access to the metro.
The next wave of meetings will be held on Saturday and Sunday, on which the results of the five-day meeting will be assessed with guidance that the committees considered to be "low".
The RER Management shall propose an agreement on a special protocol for direct train RER A on all pages, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not the case with drivers who require a earned loan, according to Thierry Garona (Committee).
The RATP even submitted proposals on the premiums, which led to CGT 'a failure to solve the driving problem while road transport and SNCF did.'
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for conducting a call are closer to review", the transport company RATP stressed.
Which was the reason why they picked up the idea that the company was "making out of weekend sports".
In the following hours, about 150 drivers had a business committee in its Paris seat.
The conduct which eventually refused any discussion during the proceedings was therefore decided in the interest of "incidence" to meet.
The danger is that the conflict in the afternoon will also spread on RR B line, after Unsa and Independent will announce the status quo.
The Committees shall apply for a premium of from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jeh), Independents (Independent)) and shall make it difficult to meet the employment conditions on this line which transport millions of passengers daily.
Direct train drivers RER are making careers 2200 to 2700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros premiums for irregular working time and work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish court has dismissed the Kurdish side and this decision does not have a serious effect.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court decided to destroy the main pro-Curdian party in the country. This decision immediately resulted in protest in demonstrations in the Kurdish community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This Decision can significantly complicated the role of governments who are trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The party for the Democratic Society (DTP) was released because it became "a threat to the activities of the threatening independence of the State and its non-participating entities," President of the Supreme Court of Hasim Kilic said after four days of meeting.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority-seven votes were needed for the release of the party, Kilic stated that 37 sides of the framework, including its President Ahmet Türk, and Ambassador Aysely Tugluk, had a ban on participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the destruction of parliamentary immunity that Mr. Turk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscating of the property of the Finance Ministry.
The DTP side has 21 baptized in Parliament (out of 500).
The leadership of the party has already pointed out before the verdict that the Members would rather leave Parliament than act as a messenger without political involvement.
The decision is to continue the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdulrahman Yalcinaka, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legitimate political virulent of the PKK.
The party confirms that there is no "core connection" with the PKK, but refuses to mark it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to deal with it.
The Court’s verdict comes at a time when the Kurds Community gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds against the PKK and to end such conflict.
The DTP management confirmed that the release of the party could lead to a recurrence of pressure on the southeastern Anatolia, where in recent weeks there was a lot of demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was detained.
From the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the south-east, mostly in Kurdov.
The police used bad granaries and waterworks, the demonstrators again burned Molot's cocktails or shot stones from work.
In Istanbul, there were also about a hundred people.
After the award was made, Mr. Turk stated that the decision of justice was only a "problem of jealousy".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdós, Mr. Reg.) by stating in press.
The government, which was created on the other hand, also rejected this decision.
We're from the principle of the destruction of the side.
Nothing's going on, Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a simple reflection of the democratic proposals launched by the government, the politician Ahmet Island commented.
Understandably, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported one of the most violent attacks on the north of Turkey, which killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
Snow Can Come
Well, that's what Wolfgang Braubburger is going through.
Not because he wants to tear down citizens, says the lead of the FES technical service.
But so that his employees could try and learn to control all vehicle technology.
This weekend could be the first time on meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are prepared to take care of snow and ice.
The FES shall then proceed according to the exact plan.
As the snow in Frankfurt completely and the temperatures fall below zero, they go out on 20 so-called benefits, and the great-grandfather explains Brauburger.
Among these tasks are the main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also incomes for the driver, direct public transport lines, faster zones and cuts with clichés such as Atselbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to be filled with a fresh salt that is better maintained, about 1040 kilometers.
That's why FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "to be free to drive to employment."
It's not easy when it starts to snow at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the director of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make shoes instead."
First of all, when it's so cold, there's a number of incoming and proposing communications, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has sideways and sideways.
Braburger knows they're going to be in trouble.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES is on its way, primarily in dangerous places and crossings.
The FES can't generally assume all cyclosthesis.
In Frankfurt is a special service that monitors from 22 to 4.30 front bridges, says Braubuer.
Because they are made fast ice cream, the shoes will go out as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, the police are also called.
Dynosaries’ column
Tawa hallae seemed like a lot of other massage dinosaurs: the animals were two meters long and 1,50 meters high after two strong rear ends, had a deep leukemia with sharp, stuck teeth, short front ends with snorts and long tails.
If this kind lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and fellow students in the fourth edition of Science magazine says that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then located in the coastal coastal area of the supercontinent of Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the presence, expansion, and the meaning of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists started digging in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes one day we found thousands of dinosaur costumes, which is unknown for trias engagement, informs a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones have quickly identified scientists as a new species.
During the burial, the rest were gathered with all five units.
Nalez confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The photos of trias dinosaurs are very beautiful, most of them only find unique features."
Other experts on dinosaurs do not share this excitement without a reward.
In particular, this sedentary finding is not, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific view, dinosaurs appeared first 230 million years ago.
The composition of the oldest fossils is not complete, so the classification of predinosaurs is mostly competitive.
The experts discuss, for example, when they were divided into three most important development lines: the massage of the terropods that later belonged to Tyranosaurus rex, Velocirraptor and also birds, the "long-term" four Sauropodi and their petals, and the Ornithišia (ptakopánvi), which were the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is an analysis of Nesbitt and its colleagues' initial therapy.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At Tawa hallae, researchers have found, for example, evidence of airborne vaccines that also have the offspring of birds' thermopods.
Thanks to air waves, breathing birds is more effective than hunters.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the patriots were apparently filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive terrorist with air waves, says Randall Irmis.
Since the coastal line of the coastal saurospods later also had air waves and light bones, this useful innovation has already created a likely common front for both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because so far the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America, scientists have produced that they have appeared first.
According to this, three development lines were split up very soon and extended from South America to all continents, which were then formed as the supercontinent of Pange.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found together with Tawa Hallae the remains of two others, especially the victims of the nearby terrorists.
These three cannot come from a common, hosted front, argumented by scientists.
We believe that there have been at least three migration flights to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of scientific studies.
Of course, there are also differences.
Another older species, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says bonnantologist Martin Sander.
His theory could give a solid picture together, because in South America there were still many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, while in the rest of the continents there was a cure when.
As the dinosaurs have shown, the relatively rare next line of the plasma family has developed into the ruling traitors on the ground during the middle of the country, it remains a mystery.
During the trip, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying cats and the number of other mammals.
At the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the nearby tribes died and the trias and juries were destroyed.
The History of Success Not Lasted Forever
There are two hypotheses, as this change explains, says Martin Sander.
It could have come to the mass measurement that dinosaurs have survived, but the beach doesn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could be more competitive.
The history of success didn't last forever anyway.
150 million years later, he helped another group of animals, who also grew up in trias and lived in the state: pigs.
Solidarity from Vienna after Sao Paulo
The list is long and signatures are international.
The list includes professors at the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California.
Students from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paul, Berlin, or Brem.
The police crossing of the occupied casino of the Frenchfurt Goethe University became a global solution.
278 teachers and students of Goethh University, but also high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidaritying with protesting students in the Westend camp.
In a statement written by Germany and England, the president of the police has "not accepted."
Because the walls and artistic works were cut, the university president Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building that had been surrounded by students and lecturers last week.
At the same time, five students were injured.
The damages of things, the courts of the signatories, do not justify "the violent release of self-organised students and police officers".
The movement represents "unacceptable principles" for freedom of research and science.
The excellent focus on vandalism serves as "inadjustment and criminalization of the protest" and draws attention to the content.
The front door was closed to the necessary discussion.
The tenderers call for the suspension of criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that the majority of those who were embroiled did not support permanent damage.
Corrected protest
The young group organization of Verdi and the German board of directors also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says German youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hersen Ministry of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörman (CDU), is currently undermining the process of the university president and the police.
We're grateful to the university president.
Deactivation and containment are simply unacceptable means, said on Thursday at Actuelle Stunde (Current Hour) in Wiesbaden's National Dream.
We have understanding of the protest, but we don't have any understanding of vandalism, said the country's envoy behind the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, we saw the opposition band SPD, the Greens and the Linkes.
The CDU took the stolen wall to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Link).
Instead of protecting the arguments and demands of the students, they came to a close.
The link offered a proposal called by the Minister in order to report on the police establishment.
New Silicon-Valley
A long-term payout for a secret city, not accessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 times of the capital city of Moscow, was closely monitored in the Soviet Union, where secret military research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from the Moscow centre, for the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres.
Since September 2008, green-grass representatives have established contacts with the Frenchfurts scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and in the middle they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation to the Moscow majority, Jurij Rosljak and a prefect from Zelenograd Anatoli Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt a leading rapporteur for Edwin Schwarz's planning.
In 2010, the representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises living in a natural research seminar in Zelenogura.
Scientific change
It's about an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
The FIZ company will be able to settle on a growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientists want to sign orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
Among them is the Moscow Constitution of electronic technology, the major Sitronics and Russia Electronics.
The period was established in 1958 as a so-called "socialistic city planned" for military research.
Zelenograd (the official translation of "The Green City") received its name according to the country in which the research equipment is established.
Hungarian keymap
The importance of Stuttgart 21 cannot be sufficiently prepared.
For the sponsors of the project, one is quite simple about the "new heart of Europe".
All right. S21 is more than lowering the roof, more than a monster building, which will climb the main town of Badenska-Württemberg for one decade into a promising building chaos.
Stutgart 21 came out of his 80s.
The main railway station, which ended in the city centre, was then considered a 19th-century transport-technical fossil, which is moving like the speeds of modern rail transport, because it took a tremendous amount of time to move the train back ahead.
Shut up, stop for a second, go on. That's how it should work.
And that's why it's mixed with the main atmosphere: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit circuit that lies in the direction of the trans-European railway master between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that is why the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with S21, although the 80s visas are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious projectors themselves knew that the beginning of the building was almost non-financed in the Hessen and Bavarian capital.
Since the existence of modern bicycle trains with motor and driving vehicles at both ends, there are no problems with driving and driving.
Subject: Stuttgart 21 is starting with the new ICE to Ulma.
They've gone through this country and community politics.
They cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is taxable and not state-owned.
Urbanisticly, the project can be another way to apologize.
It will create a new city space, which - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain a lot of greens.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railways and road construction are designed for personal transport, which - typically in the 1980s - contributed to massive growth.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policies must, however, go first in order to strengthen freight transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally-friendly than cost-car on the road.
But the new track isn't suitable for expensive trains because of a bad attitude.
More importantly, S21 does not directly affect the amounts of other railway projects.
In Sweden, there were six billion euros to be collected.
It's an official number.
Experts consider it a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding on other source points and difficult places in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport consists of seventy more projects.
One of the most important is the building of a 180-kilometre bridge along the Rhine.
Since 1987, this track has been set at a low temperature.
There's a need to press right here.
But S21 will be very quick.
I'm losing Rīna, it's going to be the backbone of international transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government has examined the airport judgment
The Government of the Netherlands has been open in Wiesbaden's dream if it is going against the ruling of the Hessen Court of Justice (VGH) on the prohibition of nightly flights and lets it review it.
The Coalition CDU/FDP entrusted experts with legal judgement of more than 400 star VGH, said the Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassela today has written reasons that the state would have to re-adjust the night ban on the planned northwestern coast of Frankfurt airport in case of construction.
The permit of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as predicted by the Government of the Netherlands, does not comply with the law governing the protection of the population against night-time air traffic.
The coalica must be decided by 4 January if a review of the judgment is required.
The opposition criticised this fee and drew attention to the representatives of the government in order to produce a review of the Federal Court of Justice in Lipsko.
The Head of SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises regarding the order of the night before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to value it as a "missing of the word".
It's very hard, if you can keep your word, the head of Green Tarek Al-Waizir said in an appeal to the FDP popular slogan "We'll keep the word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbe's resignation, the Dutch government is trying to get to its nightly flights through "transaction of rights and tricks".
exact legal control takes its time.
Coalica doesn't want to work on the "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The effects of his band on the ban of the night were never the same as the opposition.
U.S. Banks Payment Aid
U.S., the crisis of the big banks is getting rid of state fraud.
The Bank of America paid the average aid from the Tarp Bank Saving Fund at a total of $45 billion (about EUR 30 billion).
According to a report from the U.S. C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.A.C.C.Citigroup also plans to provide State aid.
The constitutions therefore want to be free from the restrictions to which the money has been received - the restrictions on the fees to managers and the reward of the high charges.
The Bank of America made up 19 billion dollars of clean money to investors.
The rest of the amount was taken from its assets, which were filled out outside by the committee sales.
The chief of the bank, Kenneth Lewis, thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday night for his gratitude: The monetary injection helped us overcome a difficult period.
The financial institution was damaged by the high financial crisis by taking over the investment bank of Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup wants to be freed from its obligations to the State by the presence of money on the capital market.
With a call for funding, the CNBC informed the US bank that it could already be notified on Thursday of a capital increase of around 20 billion dollars.
Speaking Citigroup didn't want to express himself about it.
In June, they paid for the help of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Key to teleport
It just went faster than expected.
Only two weeks after the ZDF's Governing Council issued a statement from the Office of Chief of Staff, Mr. Nikolause Brender.
Yesterday night, he wanted to make a deal with that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF study in the capital city of Berlin, was appointed as a candidate.
But the station didn't approve of it - officially so that she wouldn't pass the process.
But the role could also be played if they did not want to harm the intention of ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal did not go to the Governing Council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter, in the board of directors, made his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for the next five years.
Only seven members were voting for Brender, seven were against him.
The majority of the Union's board of directors had already signaled several weeks before the elections that they did not want to confirm Brender in the Office.
The opposition against the Chief Editor was organized by Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further detention in the Office of the High Commissioner for the argument that the amount of monitoring of the ZDF's reporting was limited to Brender.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, the protests that strongly criticised the political impact of the ZDF.
Finally, there were even 35 lawmakers in the debate, who considered Kokh's procedure anti-spatial.
It wasn't for anything.
About
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bengen.
He studied politics, pedagogical and romanticism.
He worked for South West Funk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 the personal rapporteur of the chief editor; 1991/92 wrote in Washington; until 1998 the leader and moderator of the "Morgenmagazins"; the foreign policy of the ZDF; from that time on, the principal study of the ZDF.
After what was Brender, who was in the middle elected by the media Magazine journalist of the year, sat down, the Greens announced that they were making a constitutional appeal.
Kokhov's procindidate in the management board, Rinsk-Falc Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the partner countries should change the national agreement with the ZDF so that the personal plans of the intensant cannot be blocked by the political majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude foreign policies from the ZDF Board's audits.
Brender's alleged representative, Peter Frey, spoke to the board of directors with a smart mask - without delay after the meeting of Brendar, he was critical of this very grémium.
As a result of this evidence of the paper independence, he could be named in the position of the chief editor without losing his face like Schächter, so he could be called by the board without being given the suspicion that the party would be shot into the office.
Frey's left- handed-over to the liberals.
A study of harampadian is performed
Partly success for students: After the graduation year, the Minister of Culture was finally enrolled on Thursday: At the conference of the Ministers of Culture and High School Rectors, both parties agreed that they wanted to improve the study conditions for scholars and teachers.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, it agreed to reduce the burden of trials: Essentially, each study module should end with a single test.
In addition, the labour burden of students should be checked and "real and misleading" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify learning between high schools in Germany and abroad.
The partner countries are committed to creating more flexible joint structural tasks for the Hungarian and Magistral Study Areas.
Earth's retreats should cease to exist.
Less Test
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university rectors have had a definite word for a better study.
Now they're first filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council concluded that the number of initial tests is reduced dramatically: "Each module will be completed only once," says a 30-star report, which should begin to regulate the approval of the study committees.
"A significantly lower test burden," said the Accreditation Council President Reinhold Grimm, should be "a stop of the wrong development which has clearly limited the scope of the study."
There must be "the nationality of the study" in the future "excellent criteria" in implementation.
Modules and content "must be strictly checked" so that "study not limit students to the choice
"Seminars."
Students would have "a framework for space that allows and supports their own initiative".
Rules shall be paid for approval of new study committees, after examination, but also for existing studies.
You need to "reaccredit" every five years – but this means that it will last until 2015 before all the study areas will be checked.
It is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation by the collective bodies established by the countries concerned.
In October, the cultural ministers called on the partner countries to move to the agency so that the full education was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In individual partner countries, universities and higher schools have already agreed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the appropriate measures.
As the only country has so far brought together Porí-Falcko additional resources for further development of the Bolón Process.
With money, higher schools should primarily build consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen experimental and foreign authorities.
They want countries and high schools to invest 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wanted to give Parliament a new High School Law.
According to it, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, it should be ensured that the test from other high schools is acknowledged and the access of the master is made easier.
By the end of the next year, the nationality of all study teams in the country should be checked.
The government and opposition again agreed on the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
According to the blessing, there was also criticism of the resurrection.
The Society's presentation of the Juso High School Groups called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future "with closed doors" of ministers and high school directors.
At the latest after the meeting, students should "should speak at least the word" as well as the people concerned.
The future academics also received support from the President of the High School Rectors Conference (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel, "We need students' experience," said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministry of Culture, with which the HRK was working on a joint reform report.
According to the Committees for Education and Science (GEW), there has been no provision by the Bonn Court of Justice in sufficient distance: They require a legal remedy which would allow every graduate with the Calcutta title access to the Master's Construction Study.
Second, the partner countries must ensure that today's generation of students of the baliary professions has sufficient space in the master's study areas with the best study conditions, said GEW Andreas Keller.
The partner countries must employ far more than they can.
The Ministers of Culture, however, did not show free access to the Master Programmes.
More than a note under the spell to Hert Müller's.
Getting to Germany and outside is nice, almost no control..." sounds the initial series of one precise poet, Werner Sölner, who, in this cut-in language course, focuses on the experience of accessing a dissident who gained freedom, but also on his own language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romanian Banát, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer for one of the children's libraries, and then moved to Frankfurt over Mohan.
Sölner was famous for various literary prices, in 1993 he presented poetry at the legendary French Goethe University of Goethe, and has been leading the Hesen literature forum in Moussonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
A significant militarized divorce took place last night at a seminar in Munich, where it referred to "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken appearance of its security acts".
Apparently discovered and injured Sölner left a statement in which the colleagues wrote to Romanian Germans, M. Richard Wagner, William Totoek, Franz Hodjaek and Helmutham Frauendorfer, agree to cooperate as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
In 1989, Sölner, along with some of his neighbors, obtained a German language price.
In 1971, attempts to roll the door began suddenly, first in 1971.
I, Sölner, went on, "Then someone who didn't defend himself enough to try to scare you out of safety."
Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller's and its unambiguous literary arrangements with the dictatorial government mechanisms, the literary scene is a literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors coming from Romania, which is highlighted by the depth and severity of the political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Sölner isn't, at least if he can say it according to the available state of knowledge, only a believer, but he's also a victim.
In the Act of Security, the secret agent Walter played a role, said after Sölner's recognition of Michael Markel, and pointed out the positive influence of a secret agent Walter had on himself.
"He cut me off" then in all the essential points for him, says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this note.
Sölner's statement was in this form and was not expected before this publication, but it is not simply surprising to recognize the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July when she read her own document, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the spies of the Security.
The attack, they may assume, will also be speculating and in some cases, probably knowing what name is hiding behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and Walter as well.
Unlike in a foreign country, I am already very sure of seeing the Stasi component, manipulation with the rest of the security control is still very diffusive.
In recent years, the systematic world of marines has been restricted.
One of the Birthler authorities, which is responsible for the work of the National Security Council (CNSAS), was established first in 1999, the publication of the act has been more slowly since then.
There has been a law governing the management of the ingredient since 2005.
The fact that the former members of the Security Council are still having a significant impact in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, made one of the former security heads of the Temeszvár said that they had rejected it.
She's a psychopath, she's just heard the end of the day.
The fall of power has been displayed here completely unclosed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Sölner, as well as in connection with closed charges, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Sölner's recognition is to wait for the continuation of this chapter to be determined more closely after the discovery of wine and study.
To the genius of Herty Müller's work, which she accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a sign under the spell.
Born stock of Championships League
It seemed as if a purely dressed commercial representative came from a delicious Christmas dinner on which he distributed to the producer of the sport product of sweetness by setting up a fourth hour after midnight to the eligible category C new coach VfBr Christian Gross in the preparation of an orange-coloured sponsor box.
A man with a brand-new dance was allowed to drive after him to another city.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the drunk man was 55 years old too.
It was a nice night, but tomorrow she'll be on her way to work.
Or it'll start first.
The words of the first three days of Switzerland's engagement: "We have reached eight finals", even in the Campions League thanks to the prize3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be satisfied with success: it will be a brutal fight against composition."
"The far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in the Mohuči and on the usual Christmas day.
And put on again obvious weaknesses after the three fast hills of Maricy (5.), Thresche (8.) and Pogrebnyka (11).
Dissemination
Eightfinal Champions League (exclusion 16./17. + 23/24 unorthodox 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released on 18 December in New York.
The joy of having Babbel's approach will remain maintained.
Not only in a mental doctor who, in a short time, has added to the unscrutable Stuttgart professionals the desire to find and enjoy the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strong pages and I offered them to be more careful, explained the doctor of Gross's soul as simple as a successful recipe, which, however, did not show any effect for the treatment of Babbela but no longer.
He discussed certain magic, admitted Babbel's associate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the fotball, there are sometimes things that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a multi-week break caused by the injuries, became the best player in the game with his dynamics right now, tried to describe the found "fenomen" with the title "purple wind" and the working procedures of the new overseer: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
It was obviously a mistake for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't been saved yet, warns sports president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross does not even want players and managers to overestimate victory against the weakened reward and simply overloaded defenses of the Romanian host.
They would even win in Glasgow, before a massive explosion came after the 0:4 in Leverkussen, Khedira.
And sports president Horst Heldt recalled that there was one goal in the season, but the other one is still far away.
We're not in the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory in three months, was caused by the weekend events that were freshly observed in a television interview with the banker Jens Lehman in front of the strike.
They're decisions that are different from Jens, and not Jens. Heldt took a firm Lehman's criticism.
He challenged the idea of a weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure on the audience fans.
And that he was missing his free day after the stakes, Lehmann identified him as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and revenge.
Lehman's products "forms pure egoism", he commissioned Heldt and announced the consequences for the bankers.
Both four-year-olds will no longer have any joy in life.
Anyway, they're with each other, that without the work of a team of trained men, it would not be possible to be so strong and combative.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success," they say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with an Igalitian ring.
The Darkness of the World in Hardship
Private Duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson has always provoked words and gestures of the world's Vitalie Klicka.
However, after twelve hard roads, the Ukrainians extended their title to the heavy burden of the WBC Boxer Organization.
The decision-making team was united.
Hamburg - Vitalij Clicko remains the master of the world in the box in a heavy bag.
The 38-year-old WBC champion died on Saturday at Bern American Kevin Johnson on Saturday (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Click this is the third successful title title title reopened after its return in October 2008.
In the past, Ukraine was the world's master of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to anyone who was expecting it.
The click improved its balance at 39 beats in 41 professional files, twice as a result of injury.
The player Johnson was the first to be fired in the 24th game.
Before the crowd of 17,000 wildlings in the Bernese arena, he led 2,02 meters high Click file, especially with his boot.
About a hundred inches below Johnson, who before twice declared the end of the Kličko era, but stood before the masters of the world, so Kličko could not establish a decisive strike against his dangerous right.
That's all he's done by passive Johnson to the challengers, and he's just trying to get into another car.
The click of a mouse caused words and gestures, his lips, but the mystery of the world was just a small one.
But it's also the second boxer for Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klick for twelve cars.
In front of his love, he was raised in the Swiss capital for divorce.
He claimed Click as a "responsible zombie" who can't do anything right.
During Friday's imprisonment, the champion was allowed to test Johnson out of our sunglasses so he could see his eyes.
Fourth victory after Click Return
The click also remained intact after the fourth file was returned on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of his stay in Berlin, the Nigerian Samuel Peter took back his "own" WBC song, which he had to take before without a fight.
This year, he died at the funerals of Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and at the funeral of Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this file I got only one morning, and physically, I was in good shape, causing the click to return to the ring quickly.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world's leader of the WBO and IBF.
The WBA is wearing, however, Brit David Haye, who met in November at the tower of 2,13 feet [2.13 m] of high Nikolay Vulaev.
Haye fired in the summer fight against Kličk, which was planned for the summit.
He's secretly planning his promotional company against Kličk's file at the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz event
The head of the Green Group of Jürgen Trittin has been the head of the opposition for misinformation on the case of Affrey Kunduz, Minister of Defence of Gutenberg.
The SPD and Linke (Left) call for an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest news reports on the airport in Kunduz, the opposition is believed to have allowed a known vote by the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU).
Minister for the Death Bombing of Two Cisters in September said "I know it's not true," the head of the Green Group of Jürgen Trittin said in the Saturday report of the ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it a common term: Lhal.
The murder certificate was issued without respect for the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the basic message NATO had to read, Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about the destruction of unencumbered vehicles, but also about the intention of killing two Taliban leaders.
At the American airport, which was requested by the German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, came under NATO investigation to kill or hurt up to 142 people.
Greening, SPD and Linke called on the social office of Angel Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the School Board and to explain what Guttenberg actually knew about this event.
Ms. Merkel has to explain whether the strategy for the targeted killing is part of the Afghan Social Policy - and, if the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the Reporting Service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from the Green Renate Kunasto.
The speech of Ulrich Wilhelm's government strongly rejected the criticism.
The office of the Chancellor has no impact on the specific finding of Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, a complaint was also made about the Ministry's refusal to release General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary-General Peter Wicherta.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenberga were informed accurately and fully about the background of the attack on the tanker.
It officially stated that they should reject the existence of NATO message and shut down the ministers of sensitive details.
However, around the two senior officials, it was noted that they had even warned the Ministry of Defence on several reports, including the bilateral document of Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sontagszeitung" reports that Wichert had, inter alia, a request in a letter to explain the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any answers.
The Ministry did not issue a statement on Saturday and pointed out that this would be resolved in the Committee on Social Affairs, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see in the white state of the picture and hear voices that others don't see and hear.
Not only do mental illness or drug addiction affect the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as he's in the bedroom, it's all right.
If we lie with our closed eyes in our dark room, we can embrace the most wonderful ideas and fantasy betrayals.
However, those who live in the bloc of sleep see and hear things that others do not see and hear, pay most of today’s Western world for a fool or a drug dependent or at least as a fraud.
However, such images and voices do not appear only in the mental health of the sick or in drug abuse.
Wine has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to offer houses, draw pictures or letters of Romans, are there and there they are about to cross the border between dreams, visions and reality.
The dreams changed in the state of consciousness can be expressed in different ways, in a better case we call them visions, in higher error.
Even though the initiator and effect may be lost, however, the mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, the shamman status of bloating, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Halucination or vision results when it comes to improving the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is broken.
Complex hallucinations and blues occur very often in schizophrenia psychosis.
Gravitation on him doesn't have much
The link between the blue and the dream was a philosophy and a doctor from the past.
Aristotle understood the hallucination as a dream form in the white state, Wilhelm Griessinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, observed in 1861 "a great similarity of confusion with sleep conditions", for Sigmunda Freuda was even dreaming of "psychosis, nonsense, delusions, delusions."
It's late 2001, Henning T. is changing into a comic book.
His body is two-dimensional and circularly colourful.
Gravitation's got no power over him, he's in the bedroom.
It feels finished.
Next to him is a decorated square with blood red greys, precious teeth.
He beats him, digs into him heavy, fire bottles, laughs with him about the wall, feels pain all over the body.
Voice, bad voices are terrible from the wall and from the radio.
He can't smell the voices that he's giving and smelling.
Henning T. throws out two cables from the star, puts them into the shirt and puts them on the hook on the roof.
You're gonna get on one of the players and you're gonna give the shirt around the neck.
Oh, my God.
It's sweet.
Learn to raise his voice by holding his lips, "Go to the clinic and let him be healed!"
Today is Heningu T. 40 years old, he lived six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was dropped.
His diagnosis is a schizophrenia-active paranoia psychosis, which is also maniodepressive, taking medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his own disability, he's been married for three years.
I've lived in psychotics the worst fear and the deepest mistakes, she says.
Miracles are a terrible reality
About one percent of people are at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics, it is the most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of them can no longer separate the inside and outside world, get into an overheated state that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relative illusions or illusions.
In particular, it is expanded to hear voices - voices that direct, comment or lead dialogues.
Not even optical hallucinations are unusual.
A hit is not able to distinguish the importance of the essential, the brain cannot filter the negative signals, the knowledge is filled with experience.
Just like the dream of an open psychosis, there is a flood of thought and fantasy that comes from the greatest kinds of knowledge.
The perception of reality in psychology is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, top doctor of the Clinics of the University of Heidelberg.
The Schizophrenic is located in the center of the building, everything has its meaning directed towards it.
At the same time, it reaches the passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcomeable events and cannot be actively formed.
Schizophrenics are often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Compared with reality, they do not have the most possible, the symptoms are terrible, the excitement is eliminated.
Once in a lifetime, give yourself a living halucinizer
Or rather than dreaming, Fuchss says, "but there remains a meaningful and spacious structure of reality that man thinks in psychosis, basically preserved."
Bad thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to clear the gap is in the real frame.
The scientists are still standing in front of the hall, why exactly does our brain do such a thing.
Exceptional conditions can lead every person to the short-term loss of a relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone gets into psychosis.
There seems to be genetics available to schizophrenics, but studies in both individuals have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that infected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early development will result in damage to the neuronal brain, such as viral mother disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as it comes to the deterioration of the neurological system that has never appeared for many years.
Roles also play the influence of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be an initiator of psychosis, if available.
Halucinogenic drugs can also cause psychosis, because they involve the transfer system.
When our brain is closed
It's sad that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they take expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we consider the abuses to be acceptable or unacceptable, there is often only one question.
Kasten has been collecting news about hallucinations and madnesss for ten years, in the late year he interpreted his results in the book "Die Irreale Welt and our Kopf" (Nerial world in our head).
Halucination belongs to a typical psychosis, but also to a surprising number of other diseases.
According to psychological disorders such as border personality or depression, there is also a common disability such as migraine, epilepsy, osteoporosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
It's amazingly hallucinating for certain conditions and the brain of a healthy person.
Halucinations, according to Kasten, are derived from the content of the thoughts that are normally presented.
They occur when parts of the brain in which meaningful thinking is being processed are too active or slightly affected; if our brain is shut down or if there is no stimulation.
Medicines can release this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also take away incentives, stress, care with love or other exceptional circumstances.
In more recent studies, up to a third of the respondents said that they had at least once in their lives had hallucinations.
In 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Meklenburg-The Middle Sea and going to a quiet gymnasium.
Actually, a totally normal girl.
If there weren't those shapes and voices.
It can be said that she has a long, dark hair.
When he answers, his companions look at him with wonder, and no one sees him except him, and they do not hear him.
This stupid girl thinks of a reliable picture, but Sarah K. doesn't know, she knows.
He's up, he's hearing and seeing that boy, all the same, as he hears and sees a girl sitting next to him in the van.
He may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, it's a boy's favorite.
I'm crazy.
But he knows that this guy and the other traitors are not real and disappear again.
At night, the lights are more exciting.
Often, they're overloaded.
When she sits in the classroom, she can't follow the study several times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is right representing a new colleague, but he explains to all the other listeners and visible on the mathematical equation tables.
At night, the flowers are more exciting.
When waiting in his dark room for a sleeping room that comes in small and too late, he cannot often separate himself from the sky or if he is asleep, whether the images that he sees, the gremas, or the girl with the bleeding hands and legs appear before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's screaming at those posts.
Her parents and friends don't say anything about it, they think she's crazy.
I'll see you in 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni made a maturita and lives with his friend.
A year ago, the Hallucinations stopped.
Since the time Kasten's psychologist contacted the Internet, he knows exactly that she didn't get hurt.
Superstitions are also art of appeal
If someone is socially isolated or has been selected to stimulate him, he will have a great chance of hallucination, says Kasten.
I guess the brain doesn't have enough employment, and it's about its own fun.
Sarah K., the only one, had a little girl's fear of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she found out at 13 that the man she's been saying to is not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for such as Sarah K., to distinguish from themselves blue and reality. "Every passage," says Kasten, "is playing in the brain, and the reality is also seen there.
Halucinations are also images that allow the brain to develop, so they act so real."
The night's dreams also estimate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Halucination in healthy people does not differ mainly from halucination in acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, people’s mental health is able to identify their bugs as unrealistic.
Casten therefore recommends to his patients that they evaluate hallucinations as an exceptional capacity.
Limitation between sleep and hallucinations
In our world so focused on science, Imagine survival is largely pathology, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg, and chief psychiatrist of the Psychiatry and psychotherapeutic clinic Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative – the transition is also the art of magic.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called uniroid form of experiences, especially the form of modified knowledge to sleep.
Oneiroid strains are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which the concerned considers to be true and cannot even distinguish them from the white strain.
Oneiroid’s state of consciousness results in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, for example, in patients with polyradicular disease who experience full knowledge of motoric protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps a lasting, complete inability to move, restores life to a real real situation in his own, imaginary world, which is derived from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The kind of border position between sleep and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to control some situation, it is going to change the world, but the real situation is rather overwhelming.
The intensive form of support for ideas and translation of ideas in some impossible situation that enables people to develop their own ability to pass through the moment of loss of knowledge.
Everything's real, and later in the memories.
The history of art Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his uniroided experiences in his book "Hervwechsel" (A Change of Heart) as a lifesaving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when he had a heart attack with the next transplant of his heart, leaving his consciousness on a few days ’ journey, while his body was not moving to an intensive care unit.
Clausen went down into the world he created, visited strange times and places: He became an old man lying on a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in an early middle age between a spleen that produces bloodless substances.
On the engine, the river leads to its own, on the hospital bed, surfes the village in Alpach and falls down the Korean mafia.
He's totally exposed to the imaginary event, everything's real, and later in the memories.
These internal roads are essentially better than any dream for Claussen.
The dream is different, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental paths are still clear in the years and in the inseparable details.
Even clearer and more intense than real survival.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says Psychiatr Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, they show the uniroid status, psychosis, hallucinations and drug addictions, such as the Greeks, and in the white state of our internal images are outside reality.
Every change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten, "may lead to deformation of what we call reality."
The reality that can also be fascinating.
Snow Can Come
Burda
In 27 children must be underage
The new leadership of Kallen is a transitional solution: Long-term Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business into the hands of his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding has to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Nakloader Hubert Burda sees his business long-term in the hands of his children.
Both children will be born at 27 years of age and have a strong desire to enter the company, says a 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We've dealt with it in detail.
The question whether they are also active in the company is raised until then.
And the question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put into the hands of 7500 employees of their children if they are not sufficiently capable.
It would kill like children, so a business.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he had been from the presidency since the summer of the presidency and named Paul-Bernhard Kalena as his representative.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Burdy Presidency since 1999.
First, he had an old technology.
Later, with the support of Kokodna, he added responsibility for the owners of the company and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfera, also the First Marketing, Cisina, Print and Finance.
First, none of the family members are in charge.
Burd's child is 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callena's name also serves to "crush 10, 15 years," Burda said.
Holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the case of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that neither family businesses have the security of the loan: "It has always been a company that has been allowed to attack the interest after the capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
It was never my strategy.
He never had "a dream of world power," says Burd.
I don't care as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these businesses are too big.
A complex care for beauty
All you can do in the area of beauty and beauty, you've got your hands on it.
This was preceded by the company El Corte Inglés, which just started the operation of Callao (Madrid) commercial centre with a distribution of more than 1000 m2, in which the most diverse services in the care of the body are provided.
The wellness department is located in the eighth floor, where the prestigious companies like Hedonai live with laser depletion-; Space, relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a powerful or L'Octane offering natural cosmetics, and so on.
There is also a life-threatening department, which offers more than 130 different types of teas.
You can also enjoy relaxing massages with your partner and enjoy the view of the main city, you can find a relaxing area within two hours and ensure your own 'beauty party' in the company up to eight friends, relax in the believer, give yourself a massage and a cup of champagne, which are some of the Spanish variants.
It covers a total of about 250 m2 in 12 salons, in which the above-mentioned services are provided as well as the most modern treatment procedures for facial, body and hydrotherapy.
For example, we can introduce cavitation that is used in the fight against allultide or vibrating platforms.
Violence is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual coaches who observe individual customer tasks and provide such personal care.
Everything starts by inserting a personal key into the contact display, which is placed against the machine.
Then you can watch videos that provide you with the correct implementation of our entertainment systems.
Your instructor promises that 15 minutes (including heating and cooling) is sufficient to consume all the pieces.
And if after the exercise we like to go to college, Luis & Tachi has a space where individual hair care procedures are carried out, improve their readings and survival.
Innovation and excellence are the chairmanship of this city wellness centre, which is open every day from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Energy Society of Endes, together with the Barcelona branch, established the 'LIVE Chancellor'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the capital of Catalánska.
The LIFE Office (Electromotive Logistics) will establish and manage a road plan for the installation of electric cars in the city and ensure a mobility agreement, it will organize, coordinate and predict contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electromobiles, collect views and results of activities in the related sectors.
However, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city that is involved in the project of installing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also join the project.
One is three cities that have chosen the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The Energy Society of Endes has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous area.
This includes energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not a single initiative with the Endesy participation, which relates to the use of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively implements a series of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VALUE.
Zapatero predicts a cold period in the car industry.
The president of the government José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish car industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "climate period".
In the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009 Zapatero collected measures taken during the year to support the car sector.
"Without a competition plan for the automotive sector, we would be expected today to be released, to close some of our main manufacturing companies," the president of the government said.
"With this plan and the approval of individual signs and continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of rest is anticipated in this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, the competition plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan of the Car Sector (PIA), has identified 800 million for projects 19 producers and 137 subsidiary companies that have mobilized investments of EUR 3 billion.
The President explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures on support requirements and referred to the 2000E plan, which is used in cooperation with autonomous areas and car signs.
According to the president, this plan allowed a 6% reduction in average emissions in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and ensured a "significant increase" of the regulations, in particular in November of "40 per cent".
20,000 square meters of classical vehicles
The first International Hall of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a meeting room for professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place on 5 and 7 February 2010 in the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is the exhibition area of 20 000 square metres, where more than 200 Turkish and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you can find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all types related to the world of engines.
Presenters will offer accessories, repair parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, thumbnails, etc.
Products related to classical motors, real kits for collectors and scientists.
Among the companies involved will be:Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-France Pueche, sales and repair of cars; or Cochera Classicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Externation test
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities such as the conduct of entertainment, sports performance, testing, presentations and competition.
They will also be tested in classic cars and motorcycles in the appropriate area outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Maintaining sports style
She may want to show that the environment has no negative impact on sports styles.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in stop system and engine start-up system - also baptized as a-Stop-, which is a device that is currently available only with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics that have achieved as a whole.
Surface repair, vehicle operation, civility, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in Mazda3.
The previous seat of the driver's seat has excellent ergonomics and are well equipped.
The Volant is also extremely nice.
With the tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues in the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and an excellent red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that is also presented by Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting the flow of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to win.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who are very comfortable driving.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large backyard and regular shape.
The automatic stop and start-up system is still available only with a petrol engine on two litres and 150 horsepower assistance manual.
This engine is a real refrigerator. It's very nice, marked with a reduced cold, its performance and its lower consumption.
Although this most desirable Mazda3 is in the version of diesel, all those who do not spend so many kilometers a year should not exit this i-Stop with a petrol engine, because it is marked with greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
With regard to equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial units.
In the serial equipment it is necessary to mention in particular the system of track monitoring (RVM) that protects the sound of the dead body, control of the mind and stability, control of speed, internal visual sensor sensitive to the light, deck computer with a large screen, parking glasses, independent air conditioning, shower sensor and lighter, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and car from 17 pans.
And if the equipment is not available, this version has been equippedPack Premium, with an additional 1,500 euros: adjustable 2uxenon and BOSE audio system with CD holder, except for other parts.
End
Perhaps 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in your category.
It shall, in particular, be marked by the quality of the materials used, its operation and its high level of equipment.
And more people who don't have more kilometers a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only outstanding model is its higher price, which makes €21,770 in the implementation of Luxury and €23,270 in the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers a great dose of rest for every day.

Slib PhonePiek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to visit mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachment or surfing via the network.
He used his five minutes of praise in the United States when her Time magazine assessed her as one of the products of the year.
Seeing her outside is more difficult, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to smartphones, Peek is marked with very low price and monthly payments, less than half of which is paid for the iPhone data plan, for example.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is specifically designed for Twitter, the other is on the basis of the maintenance of free data services, which, however, needs to be paid for Peek’s sixteenth share.
FonPeek, who was represented on Le Web yesterday, is a European version of the invention and also a third of its changes.
He's limited just like his American rival, but he's making a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with smartphones already know what it means to come up with data services after crossing the border or to look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a connection to the Phone) so they can watch the mail.
The event with a high price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a doctor from physics to understand them, as well as a very good care to be able to read a miniatural letter.
The European Commission continues to require the reduction of roaming tariffs so that they are available for Europe as a whole, which still has no impact.
There is reason to be concerned about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device such as FonPeek (is interesting that it still has the name Fon without WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators start thinking differently and consider various offers that would compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book collection and other online search.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid when buying, never after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with a sustainable approach like that Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm watching the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's the best consumer look.
It would be interesting if this system were also used in computers.
Color used by Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color of the first ladies in the United States.
For the entry of Baracka Obama into the role of President of the United States, she chose dress and coffee in this color, and she also chose the same color when she passed it at the second most important moment of her life: the award of Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being one of the same color - glutened with tributary effects - in both cases it was considered a complete complete suit, bag and cupboard with the same substance - with the same large upper or lower surface.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady in the United States decided to go to the steps of the Asturias princess and wear the same clothes.
The product from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
For example, Michelle used a large field in Osla with pressure.
Changes and additions: green boots with medium-high bottom, similar model, but in golden color.
It also carries various tasks: this time drool, before the hair is released.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially in women of young age who are willing to adopt a child.
This is the result of the study 'Employment and career of Spanish Women', carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The study participated 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and results are unique: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to maternity.
The study points out that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in the views of the number of children based on whether they work or not, as well as the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home work part-time or do not have stable jobs, start living with a partner before the birth of the first child and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner relations and matrimony, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of stable employment have the first child in average 3.7 years from the start of their relationship with the partner. This figure makes 4.1 in the case of women whose stable employment has paid most of their lives and therefore had to postpone their partnership and children's arrival.
The type of call also has a strong effect on the subject, even though it is less effective at the time of contact with the partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is committed to research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting women's age at the time of the closure of their marriage is the degree of education.
Research reveals that the higher the education rate, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in age groups 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 years of age, e.g. 32.1.
"There is still another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women marry and have the first child before they find a stable job, while women work with medium or higher education give careful priority to getting a stable job, before marriage and the birth of the first child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger also stands for it.
L'Oréal Paris just added a new name to his prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German hierarchy will become the face of various products of this sign under the universal title 'Because I stand for it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most unfavourable heroes of the international level, is thus added to another famous personality of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penelope Cruz.
Before her they joined this selected club of Evangeline Lilly's hero and Freda Pinto ("Millionaire of Chatterce").
The Panamanian part of this sign of cosmetics is also represented by significant characteristics: Patrick Dempsey ('Greev's anatomia') and Matthew Fox (Egangelin's partner in 'The Lost').
Prices of British methods
Brits have a lot to talk about.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, earlier and now - met on the annual presentation of prices that took place in London, in the Royal Court os Justice.

Poker Manuela Vicente
Manuel Vicent presents three X-ray photographs of writers with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in ordinary life).
He does not do so in the dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), he is still looking for a similar core of a variety of personalities.
The road brings excitement and Vicent doesn't protect the streets or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s experience, and it is also in repeated reading.
I'll show you some clues here.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, rather a spiritual impulse, almost physical, like what I feel, but can't be named it: a life of anti - judgment, moral and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nhilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote for his own nature and no intelligence, something between power and ignorance, with a hidden poetic humor, without meaning, like a knife that killed her a little."
About Graham Green: "Our man was appointed to this woman after thirty years of age, civilization, fame and achievements, which is a spiritual excellence for the achievement of the heaven's way of ruin."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was released in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the osmetic peaks in the university literature that is necessary to be overcome by the northern side of which the best horizons will often be raised."
About William Faulkner: "He was a wonderful man.
He told himself that he was the grandfather of the crew, and again that he was the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases there was a major dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer has taken this man from Minichov to put his voice in his literary form in front of him and calling him in the future and the spring talking to the Greeks."
About Dorothy Parker: "One time she cried and prayed, "My dear God, let me stop writing like a woman."
Of Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were the ruins of Spencer's version: 'After the effort, the dream comes,/ after the storm of a quiet presence,/ after the war of rest,/ after a life of perfect death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his backyards.
The husband agreed to tell him that Eduard VII was watching her among the eagles or that the birds were singing the river.
No man has ever been so patient and loving to the neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos do before he targeted Joyce on Barojo?
What else did Benet do before he let Baroia fix Faulkner's weapon?
And what is the matter with the Lord of the Throne, that He may be praised for his deed?"
Abbreviated aggression
Last week my seventy-year-old mother passed through our fourth, during the Fuenlabrada period, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years old passed by and our dog, a cross saved from a load strike of a maximum of six kilograms, without her single word hit twice and hard.
Our argument is more about seeing nothing fun in such aggression against a small and vulnerable animal that was more on the ledge.
And to this shock, after this incident, when she had an accident with this individual, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil, a man who attacks an animal, is capable of doing the same thing as a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened in five o'clock afternoon, on Tuesday, usually in a quiet fourth.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have put the burden on the nearest Commissioner, but we suspect that this was something and that we should not raise the coldest questions, we find that those killings were Spanish nations.
The hearing was enough to make us aware of this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when it comes to treating the vulnerable animals that give us love, company and friendship.
We don't understand where the right behavior is divided, respect for animals and humans.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helm
The manufacturer of Michelin pneumatics in collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Trust (Fesvial) launched a campaign to support the use of helm, especially in younger motorists, as both of these entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means to prevent head injuries of the accident and death when accidents occur while driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of its transport security commitments, which "means more than offer and manufacture more secure products", and confirmed that it is attempting to meet this purpose and otherwise in the form of an educational and information campaign.
This new campaign in support of the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the title 'To be or not to be', is the first phase, when more than 500 motor vehicles will be deployed to reach the highest public awareness.
And at the conclusion of Michelin's company, the transport security "is a permanent problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of pneumatics for double-vehicle vehicles and whose main objective is to increase the safety of products.
Increases the sale of light-use vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light-use vehicles begins to be reminiscent.
All 9.425 vehicles reported in November in Spain indicated an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, one of the first increases in the 22 months of permanent accident, according to the figures of the parental organisation of Anfac and Ganva producers.
However, it is better to give credit, as November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and meant 60% reduction compared with the previous year.
As a result, regardless of the rise in the last month, the total number of vehicles reported for the last 11 months is less than 40% than in the previous accounting year.
From the summer it was sold95.853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light-use vehicles: personal cars, pick up, supplies, less expensive cars and light trucks/cars.
And they didn't break up even those who are most harmful to demand, even though they bought private persons, most of the purchases were carried out by smaller and medium-sized companies, and almost 100% of the cases involved financing through third-persons.
In addition, other factors such as the cessation of activities or the continuation of a bad economic situation should be added to the restriction resulting from the closure of the bank credit source.
In that situation, in contrast to personal vehicles, the purchase support for 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the small- and medium-sized enterprises that are willing to purchase a light-use vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2, not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam also recalled that special attention should be paid to the handling of these vehicles as well as to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The sales company estimates that in 2010 development will be similar to London and that the sales in personal vehicles and 4x4 will be up to 19%.
The aid system in hand gear is already required.
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking system, this will also be done by managing the stability of the ESP, which helps hand-speed systems, all of which will be required by European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the obligation to provide all new vehicles and light-use vehicles, while in others, there is a deadline for disposal of the missing, which is February 2011.
The action taken in the EU is aimed at increasing the protection of passengers, while it works so that it can help cover many conflicts.
A helpful hand speed system increases the pressure on the brakes in the emergency case, which the system will find out when the driver is moving.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of Bosch’s car parts, three drivers who have a disability did not break up the wind before the war and half of them did not use the full force of the storm.
Up to 1,100 knots
Instead, this aid requires a maximum speed system, reducing the speed of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were fitted with this type of device, up to 1,100 fatal accidents could be avoided annually related to traffic accidents.
The reduction in this amount will be even more significant than the calculations would prevent one out of four accidents with an impact on individuals after introducing so-called intelligent systems of manual speed.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system which (with a radar or cameras) captures obstacles and is a driver, except for a light discharge.
If the driver reacts, it can help him increase pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, and even if the driver is unable to prevent the enemy, the device shall act as unintended and minimise the risk of damage.
General Motors deplores the plan for Opel to the ice
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, Opel's employees in Figuerueles (Zaragos) that the production of new Meriva will begin in the first week of the month - probably 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed the American manufacturer that it will take more time to complete the Opel's plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of the GM company in Europe, is trying to make every point of the plan agreed first with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will be first submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plant is located, will be issued by the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, the GM ensures that the Saab sales decision should be taken in these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American producer to make certain decisions first.
The GM is able to contact some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who has also previously acquired Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports vehicles, who is responsible for protecting the Russian Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, the GM company could sell some assets to Saab Chinese Baic.
He continues to pay to decide to close Saab by the end of the year if she can't sell it.
Garden with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this quality model, the engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of the first line, the automatic lifting of the tyres was in a paid hand-held exercise with a weight reduction of 21 kg; further use of the railway door, such as GT3, which means 15 kg less; the removal of the air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a reduction in the volume of other 7 kg; after the installation of the sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to a distance of 15 kg.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and the replacement of the door envelopes with textile receipts means another kilogram.
Also offered by the two-wheel drive PDK, one vehicle was tested with a hand-held six-strip speed shield, mainly on the second class of trains in California, on the mountain peaks with many networked obstacles.
His behavior can only be qualified as incapacitated.
The reduction in volume does not mean that the vehicle has a negative asphalt.
On the other hand, we haven't tested so little and easy model for a long time, which would at the same time provide such security when moving into the obstacle, even at high speeds.
It's a small battery capable of burning the candles in a short drive after the necessary time, until we order it sprint, spraying, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the control that is so communicative as exact, whatever we mean by hands on the wheel, that's what the car will do.
And he's doing it with surgical precision.
Engine sound according to the will
The V6 boxer sound, of 320 horses (of 10 more than Boxster S) is very creative and it is possible to enable 'port' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was already used in Panama.
The capacity of acceleration is brutal, whether it is already sitting or recovery.
The bonds are strong, but not tough or uncomfortable.
Asfalt's train that we're going through with Boxster Spyder was quite destroyed, but the car was well controlled.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the journey, and in some instances we were hit by lightning and lightning even in the morning.
Definitely this ultralight train is one of the most fun on the market, as it concerns more than just modifying Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at EUR 70,831.

The workshop won a brilliant victory in 82-91 on its hosting at the complicated Maccabi Electra garden, despite the numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice society, and thus reached its head after the great release of Mirzy Teletovic, who was declared the best in the group with eight three points (29 reviews).
Vitorie’s company has proved to be a significant incompatibilityHermanna, Olesona, Huertase or Mikov with a great dose of detection and collective work, even though it had to endure to the end in order to gain victory.
In addition, the depth of the circle was divided by 16 triangles on the final triumph.
The feast began with the head of the blues who had been placed on the mark since the beginning.
That the first four bones for Vitroi were from a distance, which indicated that they were very strong against Israel’s society.
English and Teletovic were between the main 18-20 shooters at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavic society decided for the internal game Baraca and Elijah's work, which was adopted by singing and by returning to its original location to increase the benefit before the start of the stop (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to act as the best in his group with 13 points, although 'without six' in the Splitter evaluation has already indicated that it will not be the best night for Brazil.
But although the game was sharp to the halt, it was not decided even in the least and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that everyone at their grave would not win, and 'the hand of Elijah' could win.
Eidson and Pnini have definitely contributed to the return of 'julti' to the release (50-49).
More Inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead, needed a number of direct shelters to take the breath, and then appeared at the funeral of Mirza Teletovic, three-thirds after him, and with the help of English and Ribase, they returned their skins to a comforting number (54-67), which reached their place at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavšts sat on the skin in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to prepare for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their husband, did not stand up and tried to keep the society alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and the Splitter, who was expelled from the village of SeIvanovic, did not recover and defend well, and while the Israelites were approaching the final minute (80-85), the band had already won and Tel Aviv had won for the first time in the season.
Victims are unable to fight Unica
The unicada has played a significant role in Greece with the Olympics and has left the leadership of Group B in Eurolysis, which was marked by three attacks by the Unica, but in particular the inner play (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which has facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaysian society did not stay in the midst of Paul’s peace and friendship or opposition, perhaps one of the most ills in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusan to sleep. Aggressive defense and three third points after him, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Ruby, spread the s12-18, minutes 9.
Olympias was amazed at the intensity of Unicaia , although the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousises, Vujcicec and Schortsanits, surrounded the score 22-20, minutes 13, which was the moment when the battle between obstacles with USABeverley and Williams meant the expulsion of both players.
The Greek society began to function and demonstrated its influence in both areas where the absence of English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors Carlos Jiménez suffered from the unicay society
Between the inner players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleizas with the three points increased the benefit to 44-32, minutes 19.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
The third part was very hostile by Olympias, who, despite having lost 19, demonstrated the transfer and was even able to resolve the difference between the stock in Malaze Málaga 66-48, 27 minutes, which was rejected by the leader in the group.
The Unica tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of Scottish poet Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last battle.
Despite all my failure to get out of Unicia, thanks to the guidance and three Cook points and Lewis' contribution, she left a certain hope for the 66-57 prize, 31 minutes.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics, thanks to the strength and passage of the centimetres in their area, proved that it was unstoppable.
The Croatian beer Nikola Vujcic, proved the equivalent of avalerage 81-62, minute 37, and Unicay called and handed over to the leader of the Olympics.
How much should you invest for your profile on Facebook?
Facebouk users can be contacted with a payment that is deserved for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, looking for the largest number of ranked inzers in the area of reality, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The tool How much should you take? Calculates user payments on the basis of more than 140.000 employment offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available to Facebook, where you need to introduce professions, years of experience, age and city where you are interested to work.
During the week that the application works, the searcher found that the Spanish worker generally "feels badly rejected", explained in his report Albert Rivera, responsible for Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its searchers in Great Britain and France, Spain is the worst payment.
The British programmer takes 45.226 euros a year and French 31.059, while Spain gets 24,000.
Similarly, the driver pays 34.247 euros a clean year in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain, the largest payroll job is with EUR 11.592 a year clean; the seller with EUR 14,725 and the dealer with EUR 15,667.
The most sought employment on the network in the last three months is driving, employment in half of the population and social workers.
Brazil has set the date of the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has established the duration of the siege of Manuel Zelaya on its anniversary in Tegucigalpė.
The chairperson shall leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010 when he officially expires his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, the charge of the Brazilian highway in Honduras's capital, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"I know that on January 27th, after the end of his mandate, he has to go out and look for another shelter."
The station also quoted an ex-stater who confirmed his intention to leave the referendum before the time set aside: "I intend to leave as soon as possible logical under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya phoneticly said.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya made sure that he remained in the Brazilian capital until late.
However, this week he tried to find a shelter in Brazil.
The operation ended, because Zelaya rejected the political asylum condition that he was trying to put in place the government "de fact", chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wines and roses from the past, when the active inflation represented a dominant trend on the markets, the market again appeared uncertain, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in the environment where the rulers take a decision on a future that is uncertain about themselves.
The product used by central banks for market stabilization was reduced by the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity in the course of a close zero so that the financial institutions could buy assets for the calculation.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have already ended practically, and without worrying about their unsolicited liquidity policy, they begin to capture a little sand in the vicinity as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction in the late year.
Investors are therefore doubting the ability of the world economy to maintain economic renewal without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in a return to reducing the risk results.
The mobility of the bridge and the division of the long-term partnership has again gained points, although they are still very far away from the abnormal levels that have occurred at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise their own risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, it focuses on the quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have become the target of selected investors, which have widened the Eurozone's differences with Germany.
Spain has not been able to achieve this unstableity, but at the same time it has come to Standard & Poor's and has threatened a new revision of the decline in the qualifications of the Spanish kingdom.
On the other hand, certain uncertainties are not useful for the closure of the remaining moral risk who have again tried to impose on individuals responsible for the global economic policy due to the neglect of the negative consequences of the restriction of credit on employment if a new day should actually be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a small battle between the emirs of rehabilitating power in the immigrants, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen it before.
A government that covers deficits, elections and a new government.
He did this in Italy after Berluscon and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It does not make sense that Ecofin would save Hungary before the completion of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and allow the Member State of the euro to fulfil its obligations.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has given the Greek Government the opportunity to ensure transparency and the commitment of its own citizens to joint responsibility in the need of exceptional measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the transition risk premium normalisation period, after some surpluses in supported positions would be expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are going to increase as much as European companies' debt, we need not worry.
If Europe's differences decrease and we continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is only anecdota. When our predecessors require most of the study services to take over their re-scans and to review their accession scenarios in 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, the Spanish economy is a great hope for this warning.
Again it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though in the meantime "be careful, driver's friends".

President Iberdrol Ignacio Sánchez Galán, as the first one yesterday, intervened in front of the parliamentary film commission, where the energy strategy of Spain is currently under way in the next two decades.
Following his intervention, following the resignation of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafaela Villasecy, Galán provided a few comments on the proposal he presented to the subcommittees at the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs to invest EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and other 60,000 million from this date by 2030 if nuclear power is maintained which are currently in operation.
If it didn't, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million to 95 billion.
Iberdrol is actually believed to have to invest in the next decade not to increase production capacity, including distribution networks and international trade.
Since 2020 the question will change and will have to increase performance.
Its offer is focused on plenic and light electricity with the mechanisms of carbon capture and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that there is a need for new 18,000 MWs, as well as other "suppressive energy".
Galán, who is thought to be a woman of the law on a sustainable economy that the government has just accepted, is responding to the line that the company has requested, did not want to leave life as a royal decree in support of the consumption of national coal which resists policies against climate change.
In his view, it is "a clear long line" in this sense, despite the "extraordinary" measure, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever it is, Galan is believed that investment decisions, even long-term decisions, have to be taken now, because their perception is persistent and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial won 'action' Aer Lingus on 10 Latvians
Ferrovial's daughter company for air services, Swiss Swiss company Swiss, will play the role of Irish Air Lingus preferable airliner for cost services for ten European airports, where there is a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels belong to most of them.
The agreement, which has not yet been fulfilled in economic terms, has been valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and University in Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday's cooperation protocol on the establishment of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The company estimates 20 million investments by 2012, of which 50% belong to Ferrovial.
One of the media tasks will be the research of energy efficiency in the remote and airport.
Action moves its first distance to Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Action is at the heart of its first concession to the border in Australia, which is the market where it is already working as an energy and water business.
The position on which it is agreed is the tunnel devoted to $1,700 million in Australia (about €1,047 million).
His rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hottief.
The five-mile tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest opportunity for Action to settle in this country as a construction and concessional remote undertaking.
The workshop has already had a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initiative in English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has the final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the mine.
It is expected that tenders will be submitted in the month of May, and the planned investment will reach $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and in the final phase, three groups will compete with significant presence in European buildings.
The company called Transcity is led by Action, the only Spanish company in competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghela.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies in Italy, and the second is one of the largest European specialists on the ground.
Against the Action Group, the Group of Northern Direct is in the game with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and Bouygues French Construction Group.
The third and last group that has gone through the network has the name LBRJV and shares it with the Australian capital Lighton (the daughter of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by the ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (the property of the German Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specialized in the civil building of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatization, but does not make it a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of local construction companies.
The strategies referred to in Hochtif or Bilfinger are still an example for Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to Asian references.
The ACS received a market position by means of its 30 % share in the company Hochtief, owner of the Leighton quoted company.
Milliseconds spent
The action is based on the geographical area with the largest significance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy suppliers' activities and in the retail trade.
Despite other assets, there is the largest wind park in Waubra (102 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that set up and manage the remote facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use joint energy for access to the building and infrastructure area.
The underground road below which the promoter is the Office for the Infrastructure of the city of Brisbane, called Northern Link (Northern Link), is connected to the western road from Toowong with the surrounding route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in 5 km length of the tunnel. It is the largest operation to reduce the transport load of Brisbane.
The calendar established by the local administration shall be scheduled for the year 2010 and the start of work on December of the following year.
Although this payment would open in the last months of 2014, complete completion of the work is planned by 2016.
The tunnel started to design in 2005.
It will include two holes in each direction, an electronic meth system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane has already offered Hochtief this order.
Australia continues to make a significant profit since last night, it announced a contract with the government of 154 million.
The ACS splits through its local Lighton infrastructure of the national network of wide-screen cable with a cable from the optical train.
This situation makes it possible for 400,000 people to access the Internet and to provide the work of German companies for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the project of the building of the King George castle with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work had to be started first and Hochtief closed the sale at 129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been assigned to the tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branches, received the allocation of a 2.1 km-long tunnel for a distance in Slovenia of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after working on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck, Rakousko, for 130 million.
In this way Alpine enhances its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the duration of implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a promotion in Renfe
Renfe provided advertising and marketing services for the last two years by Ms. Rushmore's agency for about three million euros a year, informing the railway company.
The contract contains the possibility of extension for 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was elected from among the 16 agencies represented in the competition published by Renfe, from which four of them were finalised, including TBWA which was responsible for making advertising in the last three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will be old enough to propose and produce a campaign.
63 million for France Télécom for the winding up of competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions which belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of strong and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and trust programmes were consumed at the end of the regulation.
This former French monopoly and the state company has purchased more than EUR 560 million since 1994 for the theft of its competitors.
The claim lodged yesterday was raised de facto because the competition authority is believed to have allowed France Télécom a similar transition as in the past, and therefore has been reciprocated.
Trade with applications
On the other hand, the mobile area of the French company is still a star between other operators and has opened up trade with Internet applications with a view to increasing revenue that will not result from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, trade with Orange applications will be active in France and Great Britain.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for accession to other countries such as Spain.
The game in the champions league has brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Barce
The League of Masters has been a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have produced 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth largest educational club in competition.
The list's on Manchester United.
The list's on Manchester United.
Wining the League of Masters of UEFA does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big club.
To the extent that the competition splits EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 associations (from 12 Spanish), which participated in this event from the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona came out of this department very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he received to participate, and the only one with AC Milan who won three times the main price.
The Catalan current champion and the final victory of the lost Europe Hall in 1992 is in the fifth class.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two societies, which also counted the most money to participate in the former masters' League.
And it's just that she and Barçu both lost.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that has received the most money through the Championships, although it has received the highest number of titles from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This seeming paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of the money used by UEFA.
In this accounting year, the agency to which Michael Platini is president is planning to build 1,090 million for the Championships League.
Of these, UEFA owes 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre-classification car (also called Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to those who had participated, they only received 3.8 million for their presence, plus another 550,000 euros for each game they attend.
There is also a prize for the prize (800,000 euros) and a limit (400,000 for each group). Osimifinals will get three million each; eight quarter-finals will be 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get four million.
He's making 9 million champions, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This will make up at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça received 2.5 million for victory in the European superpower in August.
In addition, there are moving payments for 337,8 million.
This money is divided by the relative value of each television market.
Spain is one of the mains and has four designated places.
The last year's champion will receive 40% of the donated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of games played in this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29,9% Sos
The Nueva Rumas Group published the details of the offer of a purchase of shares, with which he wants to get a high position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not depend on making public offers for the purchase (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for shares which would be paid in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this expenditure1% per year.
Yesterday's stock Sos finished trading at €1.85; so the Nueva Rumas offer is worth 18% under market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa price 1,50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer shall be subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Irish group provides 15 days to inform shareholders of their interest in selling.
CMMV stated that it was not informed of the tenderer, although Ruize Matease confirmed that he was in contact with the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is carried out, the price would reach 611.7 million, while capitalisation Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the structure of his leadership is changing.
As an attempt to keep up possible bids for the purchase and equal treatment of the judicial exercises of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and James Salazar were notified of the choice of Mary Luisy Jordan as the head of the internal audit.
This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It's about a new place that's going to take over directly from the president of the group.
And it's not about the police, because the company is still disappointed in the legal struggle for a certain transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers' company.
In fact, it is not possible to draw up new transfers of funds in the coming months.
As regards Salazar's credit, yesterday the members of the International Court of Justice of Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unica) were informed and confirmed that they had accepted a transfer of 212 million without knowing the place to which they were assigned.
CMMV allows options for the removal of Pateriny, who participated in Inverseor Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) granted an exemption which was granted to Investorsor Mer against Federic Paterninov on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it would permit this operation, since it understood that its conditions were in accordance with the rules and considered that it was "sufficient" to explain the contents of the brochures submitted after the adjustments made in December 2.
CMMV confirmed that the offer was directed towards the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federica Paterini at EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the cities of Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were abandoned, which would not be able to be transferred in any way until the tender, which specified that the price had been fixed by the Federal Paterinian standard.
New vehicle assessment tools
In these days the storm and the storm are not just self-services.
Each day, thousands of cars who have suffered a certain event are transferred to a service where the expert has to pay damage and repair costs.
No certain event is equal to the cost of work and working time can be long and hard work.
Calculate manually the cost of fixing from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labour force, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, this would be a minute question
That's why almost 100% of researchers use this kind of system.
The providers of services and solutions for the management of certain events and maintenance shall be responsible for collecting information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audadex is a leading company from the American Solar Group; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of evaluation and development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
News from data provided by manufacturers is not even easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Managing Director Audadex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the number of data for processing continues to increase, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been identified in the last five years than in the previous five years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It's a very hot job, because every one of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle needs to be cataloged and set its price.
In addition to each model, "intelligent" graphics processing is carried out, where it is possible to "swipe" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
When it comes to the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minority car, it may last for three or four months. At present, Audadex has full information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models with information are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the train park, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work on documentation and the development of the database, Audadex has eight mediums distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific features.
National headquarters is in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There are more than a hundred techniques (normally experts on machinery) working with three computer screens.
Audadex invests EUR 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are collected and customers get updates every two days.
The processing of this unambiguous sales of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries, there are also tools to manage remuneration or to calculate the sales or maintenance value of the car.
The only company available to the driver who informs about the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audadex is not offered in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With a view to products offered by Audadex, it is easy to obtain support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers 10 different instruments, while the star product is AudaPlus, the standard solution for the assessment of certain events determined by the investigator.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs involved, it also includes time for the repair of the product concerned or the factory concerned.
This tool shall be paid for each assessment.
The highest price is €5.75 for customers who use it a little, maximum 10 times a month.
After each insurance that carries out thousands of payments, it will match its price with Audadex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of vehicles and devices that have come out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first number of vehicles.
AudaGlass is focusing on the scale of vehicles and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows for the production of vehicles with a full-time certainty.
His statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or detecting deviations according to signs or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models have gone through the service because of the accident or how long serious certain events have occurred over a period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company responsible for developing this type of tools.
In addition, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for the researcher and likewise provides digital images, access to shares or prices and the official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is the company of the Innsa group established in 1971 as a service provider and repair of damage, accident or maintenance of cars
Gt Guia evaluation is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance.
The volume of work grew by 20% per year over the last three years, and in 2008 they accounted for €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation of the office in Paris began.
Audadex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of her brother is represented in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global factorization of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidex, Informationex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than a month.
In 2005, the Solar Group stood at $1,000 million and now its shares amount to $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been spent on the bridge in New York and is included in the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Internet transport of dangerous vehicles
Loni bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after a certain event.
The operation proposed a commitment of EUR 59.5 million of 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended in the coming year by 15%.
The objective of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the international market.
This assessment and purchase and sale service is managed exclusively for professionals in the sector such as insurance, knowledge, loans, services, remuneration and professional sales who are required to register before the start of the operation.
This platform was launched in 1996 in Germany and operates more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, from that to 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The Web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 dealers.
It handles 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads every day to the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a vehicle whose number of vehicles has been registered cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with a historical value may have a permit to carry out, even if they have been ordered, after pre-manufacturing.
Number of services in four steps
With Auda-Taller tool, Audadex recommends that the user get a budget in four steps: identification of vehicles, looking for remuneration, creating a budget for budget generation.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the certification of professionals at a higher age, who are more or less sustainable in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666, 109 terene, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
The purpose of use is to connect the computer to the Internet.
