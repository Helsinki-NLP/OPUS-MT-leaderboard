The former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme on Petrobras state oil company.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office stated that Jose Dirceu will be sent to court for the charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Other 13 people will be judged, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former treasurer of the Muncitor Party, found in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duce, former president of Petrobras companies.
The direction is the oldest member of the People's Party to the government taken in custody for relations with this scheme.
The director served as chief of the former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August at home, where he is already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a voter's procurement scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
The prosecutors said that the Dirceu had developed the Petrobras loan scheme, accepted the fraud while it was in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the polling scandal.
According to the prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in the form of myth and other illegal funds.
A part of that money would be returned to the party's campaign fund of government and their allies.
In addition, the Petrobras directory would have been included in exchange for contracts.
The "miraculous" recovery of a surviving student of the Peshawar massacre
A paralysed teenager who was shot four times in the most complete terrorist attack in Pakistan succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after following treatment in the United Kingdom.
Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, aged 13, told the doctors in Pakistan that he would never be able to go.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be released later from the hospital.
Just nine months ago, on a regular morning in March, Mohamed stood at the first aid hour and listened carefully to the professor.
At the same time, seven armed men imprisoned in the uniforms of the security agents entered the public school of the army.
He threw out the explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women, and children who went out of the way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed says with an open look.
I was in the amphitheater, I asked questions... then I heard guns outside.
The terrorists entered and began to kill. Our professor was shot alive.
Mohamed describes how he took four students from the amphitheater while the carnage took place.
Then he says he heard his friend Hamza screaming.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held him by the hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of the killers in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that immediately after that he was gone and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the chest down.
Doctors from Peshawar north of Pakistan, then those from Rawalpindi, almost capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to go.
"When I saw him, I felt my breath coming out," said Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the worst of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son is so passionate that he will never be able to use his feet again.
They campaigned and asked for help from Pakistani television, calling for the support of famous people such as Imran Khan, a critic who became a politician.
Finally, they managed to stretch funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and offer him treatment at the Harley Street private clinic in London.
The neurosurgeon consultant Irfan Malik described Mohamed right "inspired" when he arrived at the hospital.
"He spent the last [some] months weeping in bed, without being able to move from one side to the other," says Malik.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in a very good shape.
A vertigo from the base of Mohamed's vertebral column was destroyed
Mohamed was shot in the shoulder, neck and back during the attack, and the lower vertebral column was destroyed, leading to paralysis.
However, during an operation that lasted six hours, Malik and his team were able to read the nerve endings again and rebuild the destructive part of the colony.
Even Malik was surprised at what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed grew up and began to take a walk and walk.
We didn't expect such a good outcome.
It was a miracle," she says.
In less than two weeks of operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged the sister and started to go again
He wants to be strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it's decided to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance of life," he says, showing images of weapons designed by him next to the schools and styles
Physically, Mohamed becomes more powerful every day, but the psychological trauma that goes through and now is unimaginated.
"My face hasn't fallen," he testifies.
In my school, young children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother tears him down, eats him up, and says, "I see my son coming back."
He'll be able to continue his life.
The 4G "Super Voice" service from Three offers a better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a higher frequency, which can cover a wider area
The Three Mobile Phone Provider launched a service in the United Kingdom saying it will improve reception within the buildings and rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a more frequent spectrum.
And other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VolTE)".
This only works right now with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the following months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
“ By the end of the year, one million of our clients will have access to a better coverage inside and they will be able to use their phones in more places than ever, ” stated the chief of technology, Bryn Jones.

Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson has recently been appointed the great winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson was named many times as the most professional musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, while also the prize for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a smart, expressive and captivating art opera".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine for most music projects, the most famous of them being the Porcupine Tree rock team.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at the Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launchs a double LP only in wine format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activities.
He told the BBC about his love for wines and his loaded program and explained how the comedy actor Matt Berry came to open his show.
What does the guilt mean for you?
I grew up in the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so exciting.
You bought a disc, you went home with him, had a scratch, and you had to bring it back.
I love the CDs, and for some types of music, for example the classic, are better than the violins.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there's nothing you can really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice table set in the sweater.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're getting absorbed by the versions and combined by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have to be that way if some kids are too young to remind themselves of vinyls they like this kind of experience.
Do you have any wine you especially have?
I recognize that I escaped all the vineyards in the '90s.
All the wines I've bought again.
I've been starting to redefine the collection that I was 15 years old, but I've gone beyond that.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy it was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I had already had the original copy, it would have had emotional value, but, unfortunately, it is located somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a port to possible new fans.
Why did you launch your new Transience on wine?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the Day of Discretion Magazines, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of discourses suggested adding some of my shorter and more accessible melody.
I came to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something kind of "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and kept the project open only on wine.
Who buys the wine also receives, and a variant downloaded to the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in her light?
No, because, although I focus on the longer musical pieces, there's one thing I've always valued more than anything -- the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses more on technical complexity than on the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test due to the fact that they always put the emphasis on the melodic and atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall show?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every night.
First, it's going to be a version of the Hand show.
The second night will be a more timer in my history, this being more guided by the fans who have followed me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the rest of the tournament team are great fans of [Canal 4's comedy series] Toast of London, up to the point where we always read from it.
I was thinking of listening to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
We talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him open.
You have removed albums from such groups as XTC, Ters for Fears and Yes.
How much does that influence your own music?
I don't get excited about this, but, of course, when you construct these classic albums, they keep you in mind.
My last album alone, The Raven That Rejected to Sing, was, without a doubt, the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remigrated King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all year ago.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I worked at Ters for Fears and XTC.
Many times you're described right to the most busy rock music ever.
Is that how you feel?
You can remove the word progressive.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people at work in the music world today and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a plague.
I think I've had this from my father, who's got an incredible working ethics of power.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why work on remixtures was a but, because it means I don't have to do all the time just my music.
The music industry is a hard place to make a career for you.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a prophecy.
I work secularly and I'm not rich, but I live a good life.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I'd been late, I don't think I'd have survived.
Transitence will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will sing at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tournament 2015-2016.
A new contract restores jobs in Skytrans
New Skytrans hired a part of the airline's staff who lost their job when Skytrans's old man went into failure.
Skytrans, the company rejected in northern Queensland, contributed a 25 million-dollar contract to transport the QGC's natural gas company's employees, which meant 18 members of the team and had recovered their jobs.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that formed a large part of the airline's business.
The failure has made more communities face an isolation potential, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliament for northern Queensland, was the representative voice of the national-liberal government's criticisms.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, released Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, Executive Director of Skytrans, said that the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We have been able to hire 18 Skytrans staff as full-time pilots and team members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistic experience in managing flight operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we have increased by 100% labour force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract continues to extend Skytrans's operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which serves the Head of York and the Torres Streamway, and also includes a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 flights a week for QGC staff and Brisbane entrepreneurs to the locations of Chinchilla and Taroom, in its Dash-8 from 36 locations, starting on Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, Executive Director of the QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
Skytrans contract maintains high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal Parliamentary and Mother's future Kelly O'Dwyer accepts the advice to make a bigger reserve of milk so as to avoid voting in the Chamber
Looks like from the office they're gonna make more women.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be indicted months and there are strong signs that more women will take care of the portfolio.
One of the government's views on the rise, Kelly O'Dwyer, has received the advice to make her a larger reserve of milk for her new baby to avoid getting caught up in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the responsibility of the government's discipline, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted the Laburist counterpart to find out which is the most appropriate approach for a parliamentarian who is approaching, in accordance with the previous orders.
Liberal Parliamentary Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
In accordance with the regulations in force - the set of regulations governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the memes that facilitate a vote in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exoneration before he was consulted by the judge with the discipline of the opposition, Chris Hayes, on this issue.
The events took place on two occasions, when O'Dwyer could not participate in a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to hold a speech because the arrest was just started.
In one of these cases, her team was asked if the parliamentarian was thinking of making a larger reserve of milk instead of touching it.
Scott Buchholz, parliamentarian of Queensland, is responsible for the government's discipline.
Later, the two resolved the dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer declared for Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins Division was angry when he was told to make a bigger reservation instead of touching his daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This fact is revealed even when the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works at the dawn of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the national liberal parliamentarian of Queensland, was promoted as responsible for the discipline of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the censorship attempt in February this year.
O'Dwyer, in the picture along with Amanda Rishworth of the Laburist Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The judge responsible for the discipline, Phillip Rudddock, was dismissed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censorship by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, the Freeman of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed responsible with attached discipline.
Nickolik kept on the first page of the newspaper, after discovering that he had sent Turnbull a message in which he asked him to refuse to oppose Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter, Olivia, was born in May.
It is one of the three parliamentarians who became mothers this year.
The Laburist party's spokesman, Catherine King, said the honours that the vote for the mothers who support it was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven years]," she wrote on Twitter.
The responsibility for discipline should have been known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the office at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who declared the wish of more women in his cabin.
"People don't want to see more women in terms of power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," said the prime minister in front of Parliament's reports.
Abbott included one woman in his first cabinet and, after the pressure sustained to increase female representation in Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the rest of December.
Five things that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull wants.
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.
Tuesday, the lobby groups in the business sector did not know how to show more enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's profits as prime minister.
The main reason is that a large part of what many of them would like to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply arrived in a negotiated suspension due to Abbott's political "crash-or-crash-through" style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke to the Union about their hope in the ability of Turnbull to satisfy public interest, reach a political agreement and do good things.
So what exactly awaits the country's largest companies and their representatives of our new prime minister?
CHAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising.
Turnbull himself set the right to start the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech in which he announced in the medium of that provocation, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChAFTA) represented the central point of his attack on the Laburist leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised "revolving economic sensitivism" by the Laburist Party on the issue and expressed concern over the racist attempt of the critics.
"In the context of CHAFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than the losses," he said in the same speech.
The business environment expects him to win this debate.
Don Argus, a legend representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and James Packer, the billionaire of the gambling industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and this will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
The Ministry for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of Analysis Harper.
This could still lead to some divergences with the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts, to decide whether consumers will suffer from the lack of competition.
It is referred to as "Effect Assessment" because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions, but also the effect it will have on competition and the market.
The way this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the result.
An analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to leave the market for smaller operators.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the biggest dealers with the appellant.
Turnbull now realizes that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he's going to do next.
CAA failed to claim that if Turnbull follows Harper's analysis recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is that the new prime minister has decided to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, what Turnbull seems to do by leaving Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Enterprises (which is on the part of Harper's recommendations), to support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Medieval diet may contribute to the prevention of cancer in the blood
Spanish researchers have followed women with age ranging from sixteen to eight years of age.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and meslin oil have reduced the likelihood of cancer to the blood.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplicity table under the question mark
Terrence Howard thinks I've completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The negative person from the Empire declared for the Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think once one is equal to one.
"How is it equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that both have no value, because once he has no effect.
Once I do two, because the square root of the four is two, so what is the square root of the two?
It should be one, but we say it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't understand what you mean.
Surprisingly, Howard's teachers didn't agree with his theory, so he gave up at Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean, you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the name "Terryology".
The actor argues that he spends his time painting and recollecting the surfaces, serum, magnets and plastics to illustrate the theory “one time” and other similar theories of his.
He declared for the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "more complex, bi-dimensional and tridimensional, interrelated with copper or magnetic resins".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the US 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and methods for improved construction tools”).
Also, the actor from "After an Idolatry" says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "shake it" if he saw Terrilogy.
"You know," he says, "we've been asking me since I was three and a half years old why a bullet is turning around?"
Why doesn't it become a triungha or a patillate?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the entire course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once they do one," he said.
You won't need to grow in ignorance anymore.
In twelve years from now, they'll know that once I do two.
We're about to discover a new truth.
Universal mathematical truth.
We'll check in any 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitating Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
Tuesday, during the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang a little at the Wheel of Impression of Fallon, interpreting "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, and then displaying the voice qualities with the melody "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with the voice of Aguilera.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weekend.
In this week, Grande's name has all appeared in print.
On the same day he went to Good Morning America, where he opened the show with the incident of the goose.
Taco Bell hopes that "Cantina" restaurants where wine will be used to become points of urban interest
You want to spend an elegant night in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On 22 September, the fast food restaurant chain in Mexican style will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a menu of type cut off of apertures, a freshly painted by a local artist and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first test location of the "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants, which is directed to young people, concentrated increasingly in the city centre.
Taco Bell, which has about 6000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in the south and is associated with cheap, fast-paced food, such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With a 7 USD average Taco Bell payment note, the company used drive-through service and fast service to attract the number of customers needed to profit.
But Taco Bell says that, in order to address the new generations that "search the most central urban centres in which to live, work and enjoy", testing sites must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
To make a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy a land mine in such a area as Wicker Park?
"You won't be allowed," said U.S. TODAY Neil Borkan, French Taco Bell who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you can see food on your own" before being prepared, declared for Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of Taco Bell development.
Also, wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will be used in the new location, following the recent example of many of Taco Bell competitions.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks cafés offer “nightly” menu that includes beer, wine and tastes.
One thousand of the about 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company stated that another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an internal court and a sale window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annex indicate that the fast food restaurant wants to attract other clients outside who are looking for fast food at night.
Taco Bell first decided on a higher quality heating line in 2012, when he opened Cantina and Burritos more expensive, to compete with Chipotle, the project was supported by an advertising campaign based on the content of new preparations.
If they succeed, Cantina restaurants will represent another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell stated that, by 2022, he intends to open 2,000 restaurants in the United States.
As Sandland declared for AP, "a few hundred" of these will be "Cantina".
They burned the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John only a few days later in the night after the British artist publicly declared that he wanted to interview the Russian politician to discuss the old Russian law together.
The British gay singer, declared gay, tried unsuccessfully to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after he challenged the protests from this court and supported two concerts in 2013, a period in which the country's history was based, following the adoption of conflicting laws prohibiting "homosexual propaganda" in the minority.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, British artist criticised these laws and made in front of the fans the following statement: "Even though I'm gay, I've always felt that I'm welcome here in Russia."
If I wouldn't be honest about what they are, I wouldn't be able to make these songs.
He does not teach gays.
It represents the way I express my life.
If we start judging people for something like this, then the outside world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist realized that he wanted to talk to Putin to discuss this controversial matter.
So far, there is no clear information about the telephone discussion among the two personalities.
Cocos has "song" all in the ANRP directory
The businessman Dorin Cocos tried to save himself from an intrusion, "candidate" in front of the judges and detailing how he contributed millions of euros to the former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday at the Inalta Court of Cassation and Justice in the file in which he was convicted of child abuses or Alin Cocos, former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Disappearances under the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was attacked by the integrity-building park.
He recognized all the charges and reported to the judges on how he helped businessman George Stelian in the case of ANRP disagreements, instead of seeking to be tried more quickly and taking account of his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos showed that he had known George Stelian since 2006 and that he became involved with it after more real estate transactions.
He explained that Sergius Diacomatua had taken him in 2010, and he told him that he was working at ANRP.
I later found out that (Diacomou, n.r.) is Vice-President, and because George Stelian had a file on ANRP, I asked him to help us.
I promised her money, $2.5 million, the money I told her I'd give them in more than a decade.
I promised her and supported her political support, so that she could work.
"Diacomou told me when he helped me, but he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.
He also said that, by his knowledge, he had entered into the relationship with the Dumitraan Crinuta, who was then head of the Central Commission of Despagubiri, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For George Stelian's second file, I knew it wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomou already had political support, I gave him five million euros.
Crinute Dumitrian a million euros, Dragos Bogdan gave him 800,000 euros.
I need all these money in the past, to make sure that the file will be resolved.
"The father said to them, "He's solving the file, his bag is gone," said Cocos.
Asked why he was able to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of the second file of Gheorghe Stelian.
I got, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only got EUR 1.2 million.
In 2013 we also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," said Cocos.
He has already shown that "it was noticeable that the ANRP was all understood before sitting."
I didn't have the emotion that they wouldn't vote positive.
All the functions were political in the ANRP, but I didn't personally help Diacomou.
"I told him that I helped him politics just to put him down," Cocos concluded the statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at DNA last night, for just five minutes, while he presented new documents in the "Turcen - Rovinari" file.
Victor Ponta fled to DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive for a discussion on the margin of the file in which it is searched for false entries under the private signature, which is complicated to tax exaggerate and save money, Victor Ponta went from his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he might have sent to them by law.
It wasn't like that, the prosecutor asked for no time, the first leaving after five minutes, while he left several documents to register.
I wanted to present (the file, no.) the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what is going on with the service providers' contracts.
I say we've done a job, the prosecutor says we haven't done, the European Court of Justice has told us to see the work of both, because, as long as the taxes have been paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all the delays of the European Union, we do not have a case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, on the issue of DNA.
Ponta further stated that the European Court should, in its own view, apply if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the chief expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call it back to the hearing, but also to give him an answer to his requests, by which he breaks the file.
Johannes was able to save his untelevisioned mandate
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And don't even wear a device like that, since you pay you a TV set with energy bill.
Insa, if you're head of the state, things change radically.
For practical reasons, it is pointed out that in the course of the position of the President of Romania, it is also the reminder of everyday realities.
President Johannis is currently in a full list in the office or from Cotroceni.
It's just that, to the surprise of even the closest people you know from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johannis refuses to have a television in the presidential office.
And after not watching TV - no program, not even the RTL or Pro Sieben - the president doesn't listen to any radio posts and doesn't read the newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive "a negative monitoring" on which, for example, the predecessor or a question with priority.
Instead, Johannis is happy to receive only the report with the messages that put him in a positive light.
And along this computerized self-sustainment, where the only broad is the access of the facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its Passivity, the head of the state imposes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been so much time since its installation, Johannis has not yet signed the statements of loyalty more than half of the Presidential Administration's employees.
What becomes a more serious problem, both in human terms and in legal terms.
Links and peace
Those of the presidential precedent are already clear that no one and nothing can ever shoot "feng shui" from the state branch office.
Where's the line and peace.
What's right, just after the new hour without a minute (no more, not less!), tomorrow, when the ex-wife of Sibi will present the officials.
A habit that probably didn't disappear from time to time when the capital of the city of Cibin was running.
And about the fact that Johannis doesn't want a TV in the office has already been born unnumbered legend, being people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to point to the variant that the president would try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially that there's no radio device.
Only that, in this rhythm, follows to meditate as much intuneric as possible, so that lighting devices can also hide audio-video recording techniques.
All right, all right.
In addition, another wonder from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery of only "the objective monitoring" of the president's activities to the head of the state.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johannis or his wife, the head of the state will get the bureau to continue it.
If not, no!
And more interestingly, it is that it has been banned from "neglective monitoring" under the conditions in which, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a follow-up to the night television broadcasts in which he was criticized, but every morning, with priority, negative messages.
That doesn't mean the museums that helped him with something, but, that's what, the content management is!
And the little one can never have an excuse that he was not well informed of alternative sources.
Not out, not confirmed
Now, until then, the mystery and why he doesn't want to see Klaus Johannis on television.
Until then, it would be even more important to resolve, regardless of the wording, the contractual situation of the employees of the Presidency.
In order to be able to work here, they are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of the state in force and to sign and sign it.
Only as since December and so far, Klaus Johannis has not signed to confirm any of these statements, although this has to take place in the most 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff of the Cotroceni Palace have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state did not sign the declaration personally, they should be given out.
It's just that all of these didn't get any negative opinion!
So, in a sense, I can come by any inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, hundreds of people have received their wages at least somewhere beyond the law.
That's until the president's vote if he's out or confirmed his position, the decision is strictly his.
The authorities said a teenager was headed for an attack against Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S.
The inspired ISIS plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the United States was more "aspirational order" than operationally, confirmed a police source for Fox News in March.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when the law enforcement authorities gave up the plan.
The plan is the same as the Texas representative Mike McCaul, the President of Internal Security during a Sunday interview, declared a source for Fox News.
"We closely monitor the threats against the Pope to visit him in the United States," McCaul said at "Thhis Week" from the ABC.
Pope Francis was not mentioned for the specific title of the plan in a newsletter.
of the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, stating that the teenager was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, having as a “foreign tenant during a high-level event”.
The Bulletin notes that the minority has been radicalised through social networks.
It is possible that the teenager may suffer from a mental illness, declared a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving specific details about the youth’s disease.
On Sunday, McCaul also recognized the potential for an attack by such a "single hole" at the level of the entire nation and noted that it was informed by the Secret Services about a "secretly secret location" for the Pope's visit.
And with this, there's a great security risk... so, as the date approaches, I think we'll be with all very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this stuff.
The sword from the environmental period discovered in copper suffered a violent death, says experts
The Irish archaeologists discovered the first details of the strange sleek from the middle of the period, found at the age of 215 years.
The Collowey, Sligo, has fallen during a storm that has passed this year, bringing to light the mammoth sight of a skeletal in between its ruins.
The Irish National Monuments Service has brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyse the remains, thus revealing a fascinating story.
"He was killed violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
On the upper side of the chest, it's caused by bone damage. It's got one of the results in the left hand, which suggests it's trying to show up.
The shield is of a youth between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know whether he was killed in the war or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after the Christian ritual, with the head directed towards the west.
"Probably it was buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said for FoxNews.com that the man who planted the boy didn't know how to die.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unexpected one," she said.
There are historical documents that confirm that there is a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible consequences for them.
There is yet an unseen aspect of discovering: the height of the youth.
"Avea 1 meter 77", says Dowd.
For temporary environmental society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what the babies think about food
National Health Institutes (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what little children think about food.
The project, called "The Way in which babies and young children understand the food" is derived from the University of Chicago and has so far established that young people are not intended to eat lynching food from other people or who have grown up with other people.
According to the project's funding, "equipped food is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have healthy diets from a nutritional point of view".
There are evidence that the first food models of babies and young children have long-term consequences for the health of the entire life.
The premium for this study is that they lack research on how to feed babies.
"In spite of the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychiatry for the development of the child has devoted little attention to the study of how babies and young children understand, learn and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social impacts on the choice and consumption of food for babies and young children.
Researchers say that babies have "a limited knowledge of food".
Children between three and six years of age are "I know more about food than babies and young children", but they are "extreme motor consumers".
An actress who played at "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indistinct exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the "Star Trek: Voyager" series was arrested in the east of Tennessee, accused of being exposed to children.
More media channels report that the 41-year-old actress Jennifer Ann Lien, who played Kes's role in the television series, is accused of two indistinct exposure crimes, involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3, at Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found her naked under a basket on the couch.
The officers said Lien refused their demands to dress up.
The chief of police from Harriman, Randy Heidle, says Lien's head has brought more charges, while the corporate viewing in the form of a grave, after the incident in April, says Lien entered a police car with a personal car.
He still doesn't know if he's a lawyer.
Police identified the victim killed found in the Epping Forest
A man whose body was decomposed was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in northern London.
The Turkish-born man was located in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of the month, August 17th.
A post-mortem analysis has shown that he was killed, and the detectives say his body is probably found in the Epping forest for weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, from the Metropolitan Police, said: "Mr. Aksakal was well-known at the local level as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find out from the Green Lanes community information to help us in research.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist place, where you can find a café and a boat ride.
It is also driven by intense traffic.
We ask all those who have been in the area in the last few weeks and may have noticed some unusual activity or who will give us a break, to come and talk to us.
Super chief: Six Women Jongling Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, there is no centralised policy on maternity leave paid in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's executive director, Marissa Mayer, announced that he was pregnant with gemen, but he was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work in" his free time, the 40-year-old woman was criticized at a large scale to encourage a culture that awaits the superfes or nothing.
But since Mayer, she herself is a symbol of the top woman, to be guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders manage?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and Deputy Director of the Office for the Application of the San Francisco Labour Standards, just got a job in government at Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss took her in an unexpected manner.
"I don't know anything about you," said her boss.
But if you're going to make a family for you in the future, call on you to pull your license from now on.
Patel's agent was the federal government, and she didn't even get a maternity leave paid as part of her job contract.
At that time, Patel was unsatisfying and very focused on careers, and the family was the last thing he thought about.
But she listened to her boss' advice.
She avoided using medical leave days for four years, so when she was pregnant with her first child, two years later, she was three months old.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of delivery he took them were all paid off.
Patel says he didn't feel any opposition from her colleagues, but he has a problem with the structure of the job.
"I feel very disappointed for anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country places no value on being a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice-President of the Capital Group asset management company, says that any employed woman who is and mother must be beaten.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six - month - old baby, describes the jungle between mother's quality and job as “a constant battle”.
The secret of not to get out is to have "a incredible family with you" and a good boy and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that will not be the best (“not all the world can be Martha in inner amnesia”) and just go through it.
Choi says he took a more maternity leave for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and ending with six months for the last.
This makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting, and you stay all night to care for him and you know that the next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to the service...
Then it becomes very complicated," she says.
However, her company supported her and noted that the performance of her investment portfolio had nothing but suffering.
When she entered the finance industry, after university, about 20 of her college colleagues went the same way, she says.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
Women who give up work, then start again have no equal chances at well-paid top posts, she says.
It is difficult to remain: “In a short time, it is a sacrifice, but in a long time the results will be seen. ”
Anyway, her children helped her to make this sacrifice, because all of her four children are girls.
One of the things that helps me go further is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for their four children is what motivates them to research scientist and professor Kelly Posner, at the age of 48.
Children know that their mother helps, in itself, save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Centre for the Evaluation of the Risk of Sinusity from Columbia University, says it is important that women know that they can have a "objective margin" in terms of career and fulfill it.
It's very important for women to think I can have a vision.
Most people don't believe this," she says.
He once held a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a web site when he was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped the technology, she says, that she can stop the car and answer the phone after she takes her children or reply to an e-mail from the street.
The youth between motherhood and a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic personality, driven to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to a good end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, aged 33, executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says to make maternity and career work together only through private assistance networks, such as bonding, is wrong.
"You shouldn't be lucky or winning lottery tickets to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small wages, the deficit health system and lack of a paid maternity allowance.
"As a society, we don't care about others," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who were just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while following the courses of law school, gave birth to the child while he was in the first bus.
With a couple and a child who were based on the health care provided by the bus, the employer could take a maternity grant for just two weeks, then return to the service.
Lisa Mosko, fashion-styled and mother of two children, says that less and less women will abandon their profession if they benefit from more social support, in the form of day-care services from companies, keeping the programmes laid down by common agreement and accepting the fact that the work does not mean that you are on the programme.
In the face of logistical constraints, says Moscow, the additional pressure to act in a area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epithet of a lack of taste (the "mother's dress" is one of the most serious insults).
"The image makes part of our work - it lifts you up or throws you down," she explains.
Moscow's "permanent business" for its multiple roles to function harmonious means to keep its aspect and a beautiful genius in hand, from which, sometimes, to fall into a double game.
If he reminds himself that men are fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers as they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York City Housing Authority, who handles over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says that maternity and career does not mean talking about "equilibrate".
The point of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks more like a balance sheet," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, just took a maternity leave seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explained.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to grant her parenthood, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so that she could catch her child.
Olitoye, who rises up with her friends every morning that ends at 06:00 (“better than therapy”) still improves.
At the service, she tried to create a "friends for parents" environment where late delivery of a child is permitted, and the response to e-mails should not be undefended from the office.
"The concept and the family note have changed and changed a lot," says Olatoye.
"The family is very different from what happened 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian Moors say they fooled Elton John about a phone from Putin.
For Chinese it seemed too beautiful to be true: a phone from Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, to Sir Elton John, a singer and a militar for the rights of sexual minorities, in which he talks about the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant position on Instagram in which the Russian leader thanked him for dealing with the problem, it immediately became clear that anyone would have called him last night, certainly not being Putin.
The Kremlin has already declared he has no knowledge of that conversation.
And Wednesdays, two famous Russian mortals recognized that they, not the president, were foreign voices from the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was a little unlikely that Putin would like to meet with him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, gave the president's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov.
"We, it seems that Elton John really expected this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the right people we gave us," he said for the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
He said: "Thank you, it was a surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most beautiful and exciting of my life.
To reverse John's standing position, the two announced that they would publish a record of the conversation at a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not make statements about the speculations.
On the basis of the story, the comments he made on the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "redical" attitude towards homosexuals while the LGBT rights military in Kiev, especially a Russian law adopted in 2013, prohibiting the spread of "promotions for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet him [in Putin], to sit down," John told the BBC, saying that, although the idea was "probably unrealistic", he deserved an attempt.
Then, last night, the song shocked some observers when he posted a message on a social network, saying Putin answered his criticisms by taking the phone and calling it.
He said that "he was eager to meet him [the president] face-to-face to discuss the LGBT equality in Russia."
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one from the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for the telephone data in play by many Russian and Ukrainian politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks English, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told journalists that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that Kremlin received no such request from the song.
The Kremlin had reason to doubt the authenticity of Instagram's post, he added, "especially because it is not written in whole English".
We don't think Sir Elton John would have been written with the same error of grammar.
Even before the Russians declared their public flag, the local media had already claimed that John was the victim of a joke.
Some users of the online environment will identify him as guilty on Krasnov, known for the jokes made by politicians who register them and post them on their YouTube channel as Vovan222.
The phone calls to public people, then publishing the records became a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many to be the founder of the gene, developed the talent to make Ukrainian politicians do.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Gerașchenko, the direct adviser to the Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov.
He imitated him so well on Gerașchenko that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, better than six hours in more days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to mass street protests after mass fraud reports.
When Arkadi Dvorkovich, then President Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the President of the Electoral Commission, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intends to grant him.
In addition to many Russian celebrities, his victims identified former President UrSS Mihail Gorbaciov, the Prime Minister of Kiev and the campaign at the Vitali Klitschko box and the Russian sport minister Vitali Mutko, who failed to apologize for his behavior at the play of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called on the presidents of Belarus Aleksandr Lukaşenko, who was right to be the son of the Ukrainian leader demis, Viktor Ianukovici.
It was so convincing that the person from the other end, whose voice was similar to that of Lukaşenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a terrible reaction in Russia.
St. Petersburg's Vitali Milonov, who contributed to the propaganda law, said for The Guardian that John should not interfere with Putin with a "stupid" subject and that he was ready to meet with the song to explain Russia's position.
The Moscowsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents thought Putin and John should meet, and 22% considered that the same meeting would give Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people per year die premature due to external air pollution, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS combined.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is wood and coal for heating and heating, but the research reveals that one reason such alarm is the agricultural emissions from Europe and the US, where it represents the main cause of these deaths.
The report warns that if no measures are taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projects should draw a warning signal for public health agencies worldwide," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental expert at the University of California, which was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air pollution are caused by small particles, which can be deeply inhaled in the lungs.
These cause heart disease and stroke, which are responsible for three deaths of the 3.3 million deaths each year, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
The investigation did not include the effects of internal air pollution, such as gas fires, which is estimated to be causing yet another 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in Nature's newspaper, is the first to highlight various sources of air pollution outside and estimate the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fuel-based centres and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on various populations, including new information on how pollution affects Chinese and Indian residents.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-free fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating the premises or gast, and the use of generators of dirty diesel for electricity, all of which were recognised risks.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India's 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
But the research found that the agricultural emissions of ammonia had a "remarkable" effect, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the Chemical Max Planck Institute of Germany, which led the research.
Five of the deaths at the global level are caused by these emissions, which are mainly from live birds and pigs and from overuse of crops.
Ammonium reacts to emissions from traffic and industry and produces small particles, mainly due to the pollution of the U.S., Japan and Europe.
"To London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
In the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic-generating pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing five deaths, despite measures against pollution vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths worldwide, but the number could increase as more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by centres, especially those operating with coal, was significant at global level, causing one of the seven deaths.
In the United States, the main factor is one third of the 55,000 deaths per year, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
The natural air pollution, especially in the arid regions and with a lot of dust, has caused nearly a fifth of the deaths worldwide due to air pollution.
This source represents a major factor in some arid countries, which is responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"Supposing between the high level of malaria and the large number of residents tells them about public health, but nothing is known about the sources of malaria responsible for premature death," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and important for the protection of public health at the global level.
All particles are now supposed to be toxic.
But if fuel burning causes are more toxic, as some scientists deny, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Even so, Jerrett says "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture was not generally seen as a major source of air pollution or premature deaths and because it suggested that more attention should be given to agricultural sources, both from science and from political responsibilities."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study actually highlights the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in very popular areas of Asia.”
A statement by Victor Ponta tenses and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to engage with lies, the first Roman talks about attitudes that bring to the minds of Nazism
The relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of the construction of a granite with Romania, after the Serbian granite, have become aware of a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities of Budapest of treating refugees "with war and infiltration".
Hungarian diplomats have reacted very hard about the "extremely and false" statements, but Victor Ponta has no longer left himself behind and has accused government officials from neighboring countries as "a Russian" for Europe.
Noting that it is not for the first time when Ponta tries to tension the romantic relationship through the declarations made at delicate times or with electoral character.
It all started with a statement made last month by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
Your problem with our logistics ability to treat these people like some people, not how it treats our magic neighbors, with battle and invasion.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself in front of an angry and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, and that is a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our job to solve the problem.
"We'll treat those people like us," said Victor Ponta, quoted earlier.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta referred to when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but Cehia was recently in the centre of criticism after writing the numbers on the migrant hands found in several trains, in a gesture that remembered the Nazi procedure used to identify the Jewish prisoners of the concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the MTI news agency, taken by magyaridok.hu, that probably internal political crises that have undermined Victor Ponta's position made him make the statements "extremist and false".
The insarcinating with Roman business in Budapest was called to provide explanations, mediafax report, citing MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements on how Hungary manages the refugee crisis," explains the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
Awake Magyar, State Secretary for External Comert and External Affairs in Hungarian MAE, expressed "surprising" in connection with "the ongoing efforts of Victor Ponta to save his controversial moral position through anti-gaping lies", he underlined the diplomacy of Budapest.
"I don't want to respond to the provocations that come from some magical government representatives - but read the report below and you will understand the hatred that it feels like a man and a citizen of Europe, the girl of thinking and attitudes that Europe has only seen in the 1930s!!" wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, it is "the duty" to draw attention and punish "the constant behaviour of Hungarian top government officials" who are "a Russian for the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Sharma gimpata, aggressive laws, imprisonments and violence will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than Syria, Libya or other tariffs from which the refugees are fleeing!", Ponta accused, saying he believes in "solvency, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the highest European values" and "we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!"
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the worst of Europe, a dictator, Ponta asked what would happen if the Hungarian military attacked and shot or killed some children or some women, in a speech in which he made more references to Nazism.
In the debate, President UDMR, Kelemen Hunor, who believes that the Roman authorities should not have a "sensitivity approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a branch.
The UDMR leader claims that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against the Romans or the Roman citizens, showing that the guard could even help our army not become an intense route translated by four migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to highlight, say, that we don't have to want to take all of this as opposed to Romania and that we don't have to use it to burn any relationship that's not too good between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any emotional approach, the visceral isn't okay.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we have come here and we need to know and say this, that it's not against us, it's against Romania, it's against the Roma citizens, and it's not against the free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The campaign ignored Russia's offer to launch Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership in 2012
Russia has now proposed for more than 3 years the launch of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, a party to a peace agreement, as an official deputy involved at that time in the negotiations with the goods hidden between the Russian trade unions and the Federation, writes The Guardian.
The Finnish president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said that the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since then.
From 2012 until now, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been forced to flee the country, thanks to the most serious crises of refugees since the end of the second world war.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China), in February 2012.
This further stated that during the talks, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churchkin, offered a plan that included through others and Assad's proposal to withdraw power at a given time after the start of peace negotiations between the regime and the opposition.
This suggests three things:
One -- we don't have to arrest the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and opposition immediately.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way to get Assad back," Ahtisaari said, referring to the position of the Russian ambassador.
Insa, he also said that Ahtisaari, the United States, the British Sea and Franta were so convinced that the Syrian dictator followed each, ignoring the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a lost opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Officially, Russia strongly supported Bashar al-Assad over the four and a half years of war, claiming that its induction could not represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Now he thinks that Russia will never leave him.
Moscow recently started sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic state.
The live program on the Internet at Athens 3 will be available against cost
Antena 3 informed him, Tuesday, telespectors that from 1 November the program or live will be viewed online against cost, on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "television writer", the post of Intact trust claims that "we do this with a strange heart, and we want to get rid of our tools and in this new stage, driven by the conditions of the stone".
According to the same message, subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", the television promising that watching will be at a very good quality.
Antena 3 argues that "all these broadcasts directly from the marketplace and strangers, the campaigners, daily news were and are possible through a constant financial effort, summarily, which has assumed a permanent retention and focusing on quality".
We managed to support ourselves, under the conditions in which offline and online distributors contributed nothing for the continued offer.
The announcement comes under conditions where the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online platform Antena Play, where, on the other hand, it has been accessible to the most easily available and the recording of broadcasts from Antene.
Reports show that the population of animals and marine plants has doubled over the past 40 years.
The scale of the crisis faced by marine animals and plants is documented in a study that states that marine species from around the globe, including the essentials for human food safety, can be disastrous.
The unprecedented pressures of many directions at the global ocean system combine and create an age of difficulties for almost all marine life, says the WWF's "Albastral Planet" report.
The coral reefs are subject to serious risks of declin (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seaweeds, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while the entire population of fish with commercial value, such as macro and tonul, has fallen down by three spheres in the 1970s, showing the report.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans due to their high biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction until the middle of this century if the ocean’s incidence continues to deteriorate, as a result of the increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in a direct direct increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
"The health measures are a source of extraordinary natural beauty and dreams and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief marine policy adviser to the WWF-UK, who contributed to the completion of the report.
"By the excessive fishing that destroys coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we sow seeds of an ecological economic disaster," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of scientific literature published, but also on the Planet's Index, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas have disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) This has been researched by a wide variety of marine species, from fish, sea cucumbers and large-scale crustaceans - an animal similar to a vire, with asphalt skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algae areas decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of crop fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, taking fish faster than it can be reproduced and also destroying their banks.
There is a need for profound changes in order to ensure a vast ocean life in the following generations," said Marco Lambertini, director-general of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fish species for commercial purposes.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - macrou, ton and sardine - decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a course of fishing that could end with people being deprived of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and the poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and malnutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, ZL's scientific director, said: "These alarming figures prove how quickly the oceans change plants and animals and represent a clear warning of the problems we may encounter as a result."
Great iron: deep submarine "phesions" that capture rich minerals and stabilize the bottom of the sea.
During the last century, the coverage declined by 30%.
Mangrove: Their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas have disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral Reciples: Some of the richest and most productive habitats from a biological point of view of the earth.
A range of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three of them are currently threatened and many can disappear during this century if the oceans continue to deteriorate.
Long-term habitats: they are very little known about the longer areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these unavailable sites over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies the racial charges that his former coach from Liverpool, El-Hadji Diof, would have brought him to the trial.
In a passage from his autobiography "My Story" (My Story), serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticised the Senegalese player saying that "he's not really interested in football" and that he's the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
In response, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard's radio station with the translation attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked the color people."
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism brought to him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who made it public and before the false view of Diof, criticized the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his season spent at Liverpool as an example of how I can go both things," he writes.
"I think Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care much about Liverpool," he continued.
For example, the way he threw a big and old flag into a Celtic fan in a game of Cupa Uefa from the Parkhead in March 2003 represents evidence of his contemptuous and lanchiunos behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure all the time he spent on Anfield, his most famous night being the Celtic Park.
The next Senegalese officer was questioned by the police after the discharge episode and increased with his salary over two weeks at the club, a total of 60,000 pounds being given to a human organization at Celtic election.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diof as being gentle and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt like I wasn't just willing to do all the effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticized Gerrard publicly and attacked Gerrard's old friend and co-owner, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that none of Anfield liked the player who led the team to victory from the Campion's League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying Gerrard is "gelos".
He declared: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't reach the results I had in the football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the boss's status, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world, the biggest football experts have joined me between the first seven players at the World Championship and the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a sense of belonging.
Wherever they go in other countries, they're welcome, while Gerrard's aghast how many times he leaves his native town Liverpool.
From the hero the dancer professional: the quick way to Alek Skarlatos to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of “Dancing With the Stars”, Alek Skarlatos does not only play the role of the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, says producers.
"There are many categories and we always look for the most popular moment," Deena Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he's gonna find an impression after that.
It's fascinating.
He's got something special.
Before being competitive at the famous show - but just a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived at the international press after he took a serious risk.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, mobilized a man with an AK-47 in a full train from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, Skarlatos, a 22-year-old saint in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a telephone from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although it may be anticipated that some local values - Friday in Sacramento, there was a parade in youth - did not expect such positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Never in a million years would I have thought I would receive this offer," Skarlatos said Saturday, in a break from the dance rehearsals together with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
I think it's all new and crazy.
Even if before the show last night he recognized that he was "very excited", he developed as a professional at his first foxtroto, getting points that brought him close to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hugh, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best representatives of the series.
Katz and the executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said they want to keep a free place in the show for the last hundred meters invited competitors, as is the case of Skarlatos, who grew up in the eyes of the public.
In this case, Katz heard of the three American friends at the holiday, who fired an armed attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately decided to invite one of them to the dance competition.
He looked for social networks, found family members, and sent Skarlatos messages.
When it appeared at "Good Morning America" to report the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC sister program to avoid crossing through all the medium bars.
And he supported "the five-minute platform", then he was eager to find out if Skarlatos would agree to participate in "DWTS".
"At one time everything was very uncertain, because this is so different from what he does," Katz remarked.
It's been a while since the war in Afghanistan, and now I'm asking him if he's a dance leader.
Skarlatos, who is in a short concession from the National Guard, has not even seen a whole show until recently.
He refused to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just a scoundrel in evidence.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ass in hand: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with hand and foot amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite competition of the fans and finalists of the past season, and to ask him about his experience.
That must have been the critical point, along with Katz's undisputed "meaning" and "instinctive messages", she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army would be built and how my friends' image would be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great lover of sport and history, never dances until then, and Arnold has testified in interviews that he is trying to make him relax and give up on the military post quite hard.
But Kazz says it's reassuring that it's going to fit and that the spectators will react positively.
They will receive many love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and of what he has done.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But this will take only a few weeks.
To go further, you have to dance.
Skarlatos, who's bullacco and wants to become a cop, says he's been enjoying this completely unknown environment so far.
The program represented the worst battle, since it was often due to travel to Los Angeles between the moments when it was announced in the middle and the various awards.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"This lasted about a day and a half," he said.
Totally, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk of arresting a person who draws the media attention, but it is not common to be in the light of reflections, said executive producer Wade.
And the show wants to ensure that the competitor manages and entertainment.
"The pressure is great and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," said Wade.
"I don't want Alek to ever say, "Oh, what did I get into?"
Let's keep the pumps out of it.
McRib of McDonald's coming back.
It's time for those who wait all year for the pig meat sandwich in the form of mini-costs to enjoy.
But what's harder to find this year?
The CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's French people in the country offer this special season.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served the McRib sandwich.
"The 2015 McRib promotion is about 8,000 restaurants," said McDonald's spokesman, Lisa McComb, for The Times in an e-mail.
In the United States there are fewer than 14 300 restaurants of this fast-food.
However, according to McComb, the individual owners of the franchise decide whether to serve or not McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different in the past year," says McComb.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients last year with a video clip to show reality.
According to the video clip, McRib sandwich is prepared from pig meat, water, dextrose and conservants.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at the McDonald's restaurants that participate.
There is also a website with places where McRib (non-affiliated at McDonald's) can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can find the nearest place to use this sandwich.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib from Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight the BBQ pizza pot.
Keith Richards explains that he would prepare new Rolling Stones registrations
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflections with a new single album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, and the other members of the Rolling Stones team could join them in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others from Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - met recently in London and made "clear registration plans", as he says.
Last night, Richards spoke in the ICONS series from iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the team after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the body wasn't quite inactive.
In recent years they have had a lot of tournaments on stadiums and sang in many small concerts in L.A., while representatives at Echoplex and the Funda Theatre.
The last of these were the classic LP in 1971, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was employed this year in collaboration with the document “Keith Richards: Under the Influence”, scheduled to be launched on 18 September on Netflix.
This year, he launched only the "Crosseyed Heart" album of his third only career for five decades.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "Always the voice of Richards is a much more loving instrument than different...."
But Richards is a bit nervous about all the 15 tunes of the album and this always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the team will enter the most likely studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give other details, but, judging after the final concert, the body is still very full of life.
The Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman about childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already passed through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet drug that made them look much simpler than they actually were.
Some actors in television broadcasts such as "Silver Spoons" as adults have been reaffirmed in the role of an inexpressive typical in the television series "Crescent Situation" and in movies such as "Cheap Head".
The first film he worked as a director was a very accident "Bad Words" in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the International Film Festival in Toronto in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious film from the tone point of view, the adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The scenario is written by David Lindsay-Abire, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, in the role of the brothers with problems.
The film's like a festival that's looking for American distribution.
Many paper reviews considered it a comedy with strong emotional tentes; the film re-explains the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic side, more darker.
In an interview with our publication on March, Bateman says he has always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like that," he said.
In books, subjects and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was addressing a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The World Spring of the Month benefited from an introduction by the director of the festival's program, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially towards the “The Hogan Family” site at the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s, at which Bateman worked. “We didn’t meet too many “Hogan Family”, said Bateman dry when he hit the scene.
However, the few episodes he had in that seat brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has a family named Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with a medium reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example, by putting on the way a bank jiff with cables or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At age, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with a hunger strike, although she is more famous for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist who is trying to reach fame.
When Caleb and Camille disappeared in mysterious delusions, Annie and Baxter pretends that it is just another trick of theirs and tries to discover the truth about their parents and to find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the stories of the actors who want to evolve into adult life have reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very attractive one," says Bateman.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with my parents as manager, and this movie has many elements that are happening the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story right on a superficial and fun.
"It's a story I feel about and I understand it deeply," he added, "and, although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly how to show this film to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and it was the film producer who got the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, he was captured by Lindsay-Abire, who adapted his own piece "Reliance to reality", in which he played Kidman.
Bateman claims that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, present on stage in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not participate in the month's prize.
The author of the paper was found in the public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "a smart and caustic adaptation" which "gives to the clandestine guy too much of the dysfunctional family and disintegrates the mission, sometimes of his life, of children to understand parents in ways that can be fun and sweet-hearted, incisive and often very dark."
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very sharp portrait" and said that Bateman "shows visible progress and greater maturity as film director with this structured intelligent adaptation, but never too narrow or mechanical".
After the project of months, when Bateman and Walken were on the scene for the question session, the audience ovated him on the walker Walken.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I didn't come to believe the ease that changes between them the film director's work, which is very difficult, and the actor's in the scene.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman is sitting on a floor in the family's backyard, hiding in the bed, just a corner of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine the Bateman acting with the Bateman director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I think it's incredible that I'm interested in filming," said Bateman.
All my decisions stem from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
To have the privilege of being responsible for creating all the experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, to be an actor, is a complete thing.
Without saying that the actor wants a primary plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman concluded that after reading the scenario, he immediately thought of Walken for Caleb's role, but also the composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Especially known for the long-standing friendship with Coen's brothers, Burwell composed the sound column for two other films present at the Toronto Festival: Anomalis's animation film "Anomalis" - a story about the love and isolation of Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsters of Legend", explains Brian Helgeland about the geniuses of the English gangsters of the 1960s, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the sound column and for the "Carol" film of Todd Haynes.
"The lights with long-distance tones or boots seem very interesting to me," says Bateman, giving more explanations in March.
Navigate through those tones and guide the harmonious audience and something elegant from one to the next, through the film.
Carter built a career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate through the most complicated tunnels.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman made yet another step of surprise, both as a director and as an actor, in a dominated career of reinventing and decision making, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
After Bateman finished the film introduction to the World Cup of Months, "Well, unfortunately, it went out exactly as I wanted."
The festival sounds like the Oscars about Boston Globe research about pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 on the ball?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth more than $240,000 is unlimited for a month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the English Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd, Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, 16 other winning incomes have been registered throughout Australia, which have shared the estimated X-Lotto prize fund of $4 million.
SA Lotteries invites all those who bought tickets to X-Lotto from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them out as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extracting X-Lotto 3555 Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of English Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is eager to receive the good news that the one who won the big prize and checked the ticket at X-Lotto.
"We have tried to spread the news, because a person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
The detectives from the crime scene the house on the streets of Beadell, Burton, where last saw the missing man Daniel Hind
Her sister Hind, Chelsea Hind, said it's frustrating to wait for the information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of her last night's course.
Her family asked the police to check out the place from the disappearance of her brother.
"I hope they'll search the house, I wasn't informed that they'll do it," she said.
Mrs. Hind says that her family also wanted those who knew what was going on with her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have many other family members and half of us believe he's alive somewhere, and the other half thinks he's not.
Either way, we want him home and we're gonna finish the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometres of road
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new roads and repair 17 000 kilometres of major and secondary rivers.
The completion of the work for Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina, all being part of the pan-European transport corridor, is identified by the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved.
The plan aims to create a sustainable rail infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased safety on the rails and efficient management of transport on the rails, the Government stated.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the traffic of cultural goods in Syria
According to the interior minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit traffic of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical expansion.
During a lecture held at a conference on the struggle against the Jews of the Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was rejected to conform to the new context, stressing the prohibition of cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular the Directorate-General for Organized Crime (GDBOP), focused on preventing the illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He stated that Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, where recent studies have placed it on the third place, following Italy and Greece, in the area of the traffic of objects and cultural goods.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Interior has further shown that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in such areas as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has taken over, being described as a crime of extremely serious war.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the intended destruction of history.
Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, said that the illegal archeological excavities of Syria demonstrate that the country is affected by jaff in the industrial sphere.
The participants at the Wednesday conference recognized that the cultural heritage of Syria is more serious and that the international community must be united in order to stop the illegal traffic of cultural goods in the country of war.
The Rocketdine Army says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified.
Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketyne Holdings Inc stated that it is expected to complete a new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give statements on the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal actions for rocket launch by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
The analysts say that the proposed sum is a strategic move of the Aerojet to cross the Blue Origin River, a company held by the Amazon.com Foundation, Jeff Bezos, which develops a new engine that ULA wants to use to re-enter Vulcan.
ULA says that the Blue Origin motor program is about two years before the AR-1 engine at Aerojet, a statement that Aerojet is a contrast.
The task of the new engines became a priority after the US legislators adopted a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of American military or spying satellites, following the accession of the Ukraine Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet tests hardware equipment for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit both atlas 5 of ULA, now fed by the RD-180 engine, and in the new Vulcan rocket that develops an ULA that costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet says it will be less expensive and less risky to integrate the engine into Atlas 5 instead of developing a new engine and a completely new rocket, as he is currently going on ULA.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start the engine test on a wide scale in 2017, followed by the receipt of the certificate in 2019, but the date could be extended if the company does not receive enough funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
It further claims that the entire company was reluctant to see how the Air Force will share a funding of approximately $160 million between rival competitors.
He also says that Aerojet was thinking of trying other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
The competition from the Air Forces is a public-private partnership and each of the suppliers must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Forces cover two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have financed the engine creation process and say that they are not looking for the government's unlimited funding.
The Bever company AB InBev intends a merger worth 275 billion USD with SABMiller
Haneuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer producer, approached the rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) for a treatment that would form a colos that would produce a third of the total beer amount in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev' domination in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also some places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer-producing companies are trying to enter the new market and strengthen the weak points in North America and Europe, where consumers prefer to drink more wine produced by independent players or wine or spirit drinks.
SABMiller, the company located on two world sites and the manufacturer of more than 200 beer brands, while Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell announced the wish that it was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which should take place by 14 October at the latest, according to British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, named for its policy of reducing marketing costs, originally orchestrated the purchase of Burger King, the Heinz ketchup producer (KHC.O.) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of SAB said it's too early to say what he's going to do, because they didn't get any offer.
"At this moment, we are in the process of waiting and deciding," said the source.
Speculations on a merger, which would likely reduce anxiety about infringements of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have been around for years.
The moment of the approach, after better a decade of purchases carried out by AB InBev, follows a drop in approximately 15% of the SABMiller stock price starting in August.
"It's exactly the moment he expected," said analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
From a financial point of view, for the first time in many years, it has logic.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) for SAB Miller, perhaps 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to $130 billion, which would also include SABMiller debt.
This would be the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which is already announced a year after the financial crisis in 2008 from the point of view of the transaction's amount, and one of the biggest purchases in 1980 is still under way.
SAB's shares reached 19.9% at 36.14 pounds, with a gross capitalization of $90 billion.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Heineken rivals (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) argue that SAB could seek another merger as a defence strategy, as it happened last year when Heineken was offered to buy, but failed.
Since then, it has combined the African bottler with the Coca-Cola (KO.N.), and in recent weeks there has been a bond with Diageo or with the Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The overall market share of AB InBev, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts in the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a report between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) 2 times, from 2.5 present.
It is possible to achieve the goal in 2016, the most realistic date on which the transaction could be concluded, so it would have the means to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought the product company from Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with $ 52 billion, the biggest purchase of ice money from the history at that time. he left the report to grow more than 5 times.
A great call would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
The families that control AB InBev have fewer than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the producer of Altria (MO.N) and Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
Wednesday, Others refused to comment on the fact that AB InBev was approached, but, on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said during an analysis conference that assesss investments in SABMiller and that "this time we consider that the holding of assets is in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for the statements.
Neil Dwana, head of European investment equity at Allianz Global Investors, which has shares in both companies, says AB InBev has faced a growing pressure to return the surplus to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debt is somewhere around 15%.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this purchase would be a percentage of disappointment, 8%, after 10 years," Dwana said.
In the case of any combination, there are significant difficulties related to the infringement of competition rules, particularly in the United States, where companies have about 70% of the beer market.
"Economics that could be done in distribution operations are great, and the barriers to the infringement of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain 58 per cent of the company's participation in SABMiller's holding, in accordance with the operation agreement that it is governed.
A change of control to SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to gain 8 more per cent and to appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, with the denver seat, would have the right to the first and last offers for the remaining 50 percent.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment if the company was interested in a bid, but Molson’s actions increased by over 12 percent, to their highest value.
Any merger could also have to sell shares in China, where market leader is the association of SAB Miller's CR Snow with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that the combined group could have a 28% global market share.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warsaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accused an former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
The Pakistani police arrested an former Air Force pilot who would have been given further funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, declaring complaints of police officers for Reuters, in a rare case to those who support financial activity.
Suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
This paid for the treatment of the wounded Taliban soldiers at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militiamen involved in another month in an attack on a bus with members of Muslim and Islamic minorities, after which 45 people died, announced to the senior police officer Naveed Khawaja of the Department for Combating Terrorism in the province.
This will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has funded the Afghans more, we are still conducting research to see whether he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him," said the officer.
"So also, Ahmed has given more financial assistance to AQIS," he said, referring to Al Qaeda organisation on the Indian Subcontinent, an Al Qaeda framework founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, which is faced with activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, the Taliban had massacred about 150 people, most of the children, at a school of the army, the government had vowed to engage in activity.
There have been heavy attacks, as the army has also increased, and more in the tribal regions outside the Afghanistan border.
However, the militarized groups remain a threat and many have access to Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, at 52 years of age, used to preach to a mosque in the good area of the Authority of the Army of Karachi.
His public sermons were moderate, but, in particular, encouraged radicalism, those in the police.
He studied the Pakistanese Air Force College in Sargotha and left the Pakistanese Air Force in 1998, declared another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
Later he entered the wood industry and chemical substances.
The Rick Ross rapper rejected the author's claim for "Everyday I'm Hustlin"
The New York rapper Rick Ross can't claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin", he decided an American judge, refusing to complain against the LMFAO musical group, who sold tricks with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflelin".
In a decision published on March by federal court Miami, district judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' s slogan, a prominent part of his 2006 initial hit, "Hustlin" is a short statement for which the courts mentioned more than they could not receive copyrights.
Williams' judicial decision weakens the process of violating the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the two electropops of Los Angeles, quoted by Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin" for their own famous melody from 2010, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflelin".
The old hip hop said that the LMFAO melodia is "a evident attempt to capitalise hunger and the success of the Hustlin melodie".
He also gave Kia Motors in court for the use of the "Party Rock Anthem" melody in a advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright, selling tricks and other products with the sufflin slogan.
In the judgment of March, Williams says that "Hustlin" as a melodie is protected by copyright law.
But Ross's slogan of three words is quoted from the usual words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared him with other famous versions of music in the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "rolla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it's "a short expression, which all courts have declared it unanimityly impossible to put under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the LMFAO team's melody is an unauthorized copy of the Hustlin.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for the statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al., Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, U.S. District Court, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, the news politician Ben Carson is approached by bomb leader Donald Trump in the republican preliminary elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped in seven polls.
After 27% of Trump's support in the latest CBS/New York Times, Carson, retired neurosurgery, reaches the second with 23 percent, followed by Bush, by Mike Huckabee's television watch, from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each with about 6%.
The support of the Republican vote in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, governor of Ohio John Kasich and former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two, however, to the numbers of one digit.
Jeb Bush, who was governor of Florida and who goes further away from Bush's family standards, dropped seven percentage points a month, while Wisconsin's governor Scott Walker dropped eight points.
Last Sunday, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson gained greater support than Trump among graduates (29% face 21%), while Trump is before Carson in the voters' preferences without university degree (30% face 19%).
Trump is supported by more men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said that they are the ones who have been asked to support the preliminary elections in their state.
Those who said I know who will vote twice more on Trump than Carson.
It is too early to say for 63% of the Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT poll held between 9 and 13 September will be made public in the morning, before a presidential debate in the Republic.
Carson's assessment in this probe reflects the position of Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the president, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up of the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders has hit 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, respectively in New Hampshire, among the democratic voters for the preliminary ruling.
An ethics novelist claims that sexual robots should be banned
An ethics specialist in the robotic industry launched a campaign asking for the ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, professor of robotics at the University of Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to represent an increasingly important subject in the robotic industry, and the models that are inspired - the way they will show, what role they will have - are very exciting," she said to the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual slaves is not against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
He's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires technology development," she said for Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing sexual exploitation.
Although the sexual robots that are now manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that this represents the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but it has to be stopped.
I'm sure the industry seems to have it.
A few years ago, the real-time company True Company launched Roxxxy, "the first sexual robot in the world".
However, concern about the high risks of artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the great representatives of industry.
Even this morning, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that, in five years, something really is going on.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of human race".
Great Britain happens first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the following days, Great Britain will receive the first refugees who have fled from the Syrian war, announced Interior Minister Theresa May.
They will receive assistance under the extensive government reinstallation programme.
Refugees seeking asylum from camps located at the border with the country of war.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Interior Minister stated that the government "works fast" to ensure more neighbours.
In the United Kingdom's recovery process for vulnerable refugees, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve.
I know that the honourable members and the general public want to find out more about the number of persons and the date on which their arrival is estimated.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I need to emphasize that the level of enlargement requires careful and methic planning to ensure that everything is done properly.
Me and the Syrian Minister for Refugees, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the current House in this regard.
But I'm glad to tell the House that we expect to meet the first refugee wave in the next few days and work fast for planning many more events in the weeks to come.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew the anger of parliamentarians and soldiers when he announced the government's refugee plan, many of whom thought that the number was too small.
In September, Cameroon declared in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to the height of its moral responsibility" and will receive 20,000 refugees from the camps from the Middle East to the next general elections.
He added that refugees will not receive full asylum automatically, but a humanitarian status that will allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics observed that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and the former liberal democratic parliamentary Paddy Ashdown said the measures are "desirious".
Furthermore, Ashdown revealed that children included in this scheme will be deported when they will be 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
Also, important public views and personalities have condemned, on their part, the measures.
In a common letter, large names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the response to the crisis is "very, very late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our neighbours, not just thrown on the faces of the countries close to the conflicts that plague people in their homes," she wrote.
The rubla refers to the global uncertainty fund - RT Business
The Russian ruby was strengthened, being negotiated with 65.66 in front of the US dollar and with 73.98 in front of the euro at Moscow's Busa at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent of its lowest rate of 71 rubles for a dollar, on August 24th.
Researchers say that the return of the ruble was due to investors' reaction to current global market distortions resulting from China's difficulties, the potential increase in the US Federal Reserve rate and the excessive reaction to oil oil.
Brent's cuts grew with 61 cents, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, to US$ 45.31 per barrel.
CITIZEN MULT: the most likely, the profit rate will grow in the United States by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible to say the word, fueled by uncertainty about China and at the time of the increase in federal wealth rate, which will continue to give a tone for oil and rubella prices," said Bloomberg Piotr Mattys from Rabobank, an expert in monetary policy strategies on emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the support of the Russian world.
The main oil company Russians Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are linked to the US dollar, began buying rubles.
The global markets expect the flagship decision of the Federal Reserve, whether or not it will grow or not.
Markets believe that what could not be the first growth in the nine years of US prosperity rate will not occur and have been traded at larger markets.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together in the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with US government and companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve air space blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Cooperation comes as a result of a very widespread failure on the possibility of air pollution between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in the colours the potential negative effect.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capture data in urban areas with great density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research says.
Without a common set of technology protocols and air rules, the haosol could be installed.
According to Déta O'Cathain, Baroness of the Lorzilor Room, concerns have been amplified on the basis of the reports on events to the limit of the production of an accident and the operation of drones above football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, more than 400 calls made to the Metropolitan Police have been linked to drone incidents," said O'Cathain.
The solution is to build a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, regardless of whether they are driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As many small drones carry out commercial flights at a high level, beyond the visibility of the pilot, or even completely autonomous flights, an air traffic management infrastructure is needed to separate flights, with a view to ensuring the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of collections in the city," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as the design of the air space, methods to avoid adverse weather conditions and wind, traffic management, track planning and redirection by similar means to the rules laid down for road traffic, such as signalling and gas.
This is expected to have a functional prototype until 2019.
The drone industry is exploding in the European Union over the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative SMEs in the United Kingdom using this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and the media," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150 000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
The Dislike button: why Facebook wants to know what's bothering you
A Look Back works similarly, adding the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users inside the virtual borders of Facebook, which are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, a touch button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - approximately $240 billion after the latest statistics - is due to the unimaginated amounts of consumer data it holds.
Each interaction, postage, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of the complex, found in a permanent update, about your person and about the preferences you have.
This is especially valuable for advertising agencies, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people will see their ads on Facebook by selecting those who are interested in most of their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and, of course, opens a door for another type of advertising agents to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organizations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "simply" with the refugee crisis.
It will also likely change what you see in the News.
Facebook uses incredible algorithms of intelligent and sophisticated minds to restrict the enormous universe of content that you could see, in the smaller flow that you actually see.
This algorithm depends on what you have considered interesting in the past and, above all, what you liked.
There is no doubt on Facebook that many interesting posts, but unhappy, do not enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what angers you or makes you feel unhappy, it might decide to remove this kind of post from the News.
Facebook has started past experiments to understand how what you see in News affects you emotionally and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
The representatives of the academic environment call this "emotional contamination" and, although they sound sensitivous, it is likely that only a simple Facebook attempt (and published open, with their agreement) is to better understand the way their platform works and if they can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen with the empathy button remains on Facebook's laptop.
The real challenge is how a single company's decision to add a single button to its services can produce such speculation.
The reason for this may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences for us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, where we have access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another that leads to a constant struggle for survival in the Danish world of technology and social networks.
The decisions taken, including on new buttons, will be considered the most appropriate to remain on the surface in this course.
I think many people can feel that and soon they will have a button for this.
Biometric brothers can prevent crises in people with autism
During the ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have found that the body's signals can prevent these changes, sometimes violent, before they can be produced, giving such assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The kids with autism we're working with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say he hurts his head or he's "he's too mad here" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what they deliver to us, and we need to do this in a mild and non-intrusion way.
For example, simply viewing colors in an application can show the level of exposure. The hair can be used to warn of a change of behavior, and the whiteness for lack of interest, while understanding the assistant that the person is weak and needs encouragement.
The deadlines can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping the caregivers to understand the overall picture in which the person responds to various situations and which would be the most appropriate intervention.
I must say very clearly that we don't read the mind.
Biometric sensors aren't magic, they need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team will work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific for autism.
The survey was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of the services for clients at the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present the technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology from Manchester on October 1.
When you work with people who suffer from serious autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring it to the quality of their life technology. Now, the applications for iPad give themselves a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the kids learn to play with your cover.
"Who knows where this innovation might lead us," she says.
Assistive technologies can truly change our lives and feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organization for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to these information and also to discuss how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria “in the coming weeks”
In the following weeks, the French warplanes will launch air raids on Isis in Syria, the government announced a few days after President François Hollande declared the intervention a "need".
France will launch the first air raid on the Jewish Islamic state group in Syria "in the following weeks," the Minister of Defence, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said.
The French air forces are leaving recognition missions in Syria on 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the following weeks, as we will have clearly identified", Le Drian said for France Inter radio station.
Le Drian announced yesterday in parliament that the Islamic state has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern region of Aleppo.
"In the sea there is an extremely offensive place of power, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what is still called the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition or what is left of it," he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that bombes Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but the Netherlands has changed the strategy last week to extend actions in Syria, under conditions where political pressure is collected on the ground of the Jewish threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf states have already been involved in attacks on the Isis military in Syria.
The blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make your phone faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worried for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new function will allow users to download third-party extensions blocking cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the version for the Safari mobile browser from Apple.
In the test, it has been shown that, after the ads are blocked, news sites such as New York Times are charged twice as soon as possible, according to Reuters.
The blocking of advertising also helps users to preserve the use of battery data and autonomy.
Users will benefit from more advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop ads blocking tool, launched its own iOS web browser that restricts ads; its Creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use advertising software blockage software face a number of obstacles.
The ads are still displayed in applications (from here Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent visitors from using such advertising blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased by nearly 48% in the previous year.
The development of these huge online media challenges, which are mostly offered to consumers free of charge and is supported by advertising for many years.
One report says that blocking ads could cost online editors about 22 billion in the coming from ads only this year.
To enable blocking of ads in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable an extension for blocking the content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama met with King Philip VI of Spain in March at the White House, where the two discussed various subjects, but they were likely to reduce the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the kings have addressed the subject of the fight against the Islamic State and the increasingly urgent crisis of immigrants in Europe - which has already faced hundreds of thousands of people who have left the country of origin to go west.
"Spain has been trying very hard to address this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel and traffic," Obama said.
Of course, the problem got worse in the last few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, particularly in the context of which the Spanish territory of Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"As regards foreign policy, we have made a firm commitment to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The superior commander told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before the end of his mandate in 2017.
"We'll get you with the arms open," Philip answered.
First Lady, Michelle Obama, made the queen a tour of the White House and had a tea discussion.
That was the first visit of the royal couple in the United States from the entrance to the throne.
After they left Washington, they started making a visit to South Florida.
Alfred Woodard joins the "Luke Cage" serial team
Famous actress Alfred Woodard joined the distribution of the future series Netflix Luke Cage from Marvel. He will be an antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero who gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play Mariah Dillard's role - "a local politician from Harlem and the director of Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change on the stars he has grown," says a press release.
Her personal life and career are given over her head by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by her infamous actions, Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and frightening presentation on the screen, which makes it perfect for the role of the leader of the Harlem community," says Jeff Loeb, executive producer and president Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfred agreed to join us in this adventure.
The series will be awarded in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and will work as a showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, 62 years old, is known for the TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, desperate Neveste and the Academy of Lawyers, but also for the movies The lawyer of the Devil, mystery Obsession, The Family That Prices, 12 years of slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series from Netflix.
In addition, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will soon be deployed, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empir" have the world's prize on the same day
Fox provides many positive results before the two prizes of its most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season in Queens and the second in Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal prize.
As related to Variety, the strategy represents a trend applied to high-profile series, as traffic in global social networks ensures success.
"Hollywood considers how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series on which it speaks very much, such as Empire and Scream Queens," said the President of Fox International, Hernan Lopez, according to Deadline.
"We just hope to spread these very interesting series for the children of all the world," Lopez continued.
Telespectors we serve daily bring the success of a series at the prize and throughout his life cycle.
The next season of the Empire, where they will play famous views such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the prize in September.
The new Scream Queens series, which will play Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande, will be broadcast the second day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the World Cup of Spectre film
Prince Harry and the Dukes and Duke of Cambridge will take part in London next month at the world's most recent film with James Bond, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced the news of Wednesday on Twitter, calling the Royal Film Performance Award for Film and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release from producers, "Spectre" is the third special Bond film in 1946.
In the past, the Royal Awards have been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on 26 October at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a cartoon, which will benefit employees from the British film and television industry.
In addition, the film will also take part in the film distribution, including major actors Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomi Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Governor Sam Mendes and the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will go on the red roof with the royal family.
Spectrums will be broadcast in U.S. cinematographs in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and the musician John Mellencamp have been seen taking dinner together for months, highlighting the sound that both would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photos surprised Brinkley with both joy and excitement.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blues, thins and a yellow jacket, while the old rock at 63-year-old was dressed in broken blues, paltons and cicimes.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his love who disappears and who is constantly fighting, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp sent the old message to you on today's NBC issue, saying it was "an angel who was sent to me and I'm very happy".
He added that "nothing is done until it is done."
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, sat for Seventeen magazine, walking behind her mother.
The kings of arctic tanks are too big for a harpoon
Many studies have shown the species that have become more vulnerable because of the hottest climate, but global warming has proved to be a blessing to others.
One of these species is the Arctic landscape.
According to researchers from the Dartmouth College, the hottest temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the inhabitants of the region to appear earlier and grow larger, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dicky Centre for International Understanding from Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, and used field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic landscapes.
Their analysis predicts a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult patients in conditions of an increase of 2 degrees Celsius.
The farmers are small, but they represent important members of the Arctic and ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists anticipate better how a growing population could affect the food, birds and insects that feed on them and plants that pollinate them.
To build the demonstration, the scientists from Dartmouth combined the field results with the results of laboratory experiments that have examined how the temperature influences the development of insects and predictive of being eaten by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes the tunnels more vulnerable in front of the helicopters, it also offers them an early start in spring and makes the development of their valves faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More towns include a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that it can support the food sources of insects.
The ability of farmers to transform their improved survival rate into a improved reproduction rate depends on their ability to ensure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies show that breast-feeding women have no effect on the neuronal or behavioural development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) are at increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have stated that depression is a higher risk for women and their children, so it should be treated.
"These studies add to a growing set of evidence on the safety of anti-depressive administration during the task," said John Thorp, an associate editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Genetics, who published all three studies.
However, there are increased risks, so far the evidence shows that the risks of net depression are greater than those of anti-depressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51 404 children in the Norwegian Mother and Child Short Study, researching the effects of the use of SSRI for the development of engine capacity at 3 years of age.
Researchers have found that 381 SSRI mothers are using them during pregnancy, and 159 of them have been treated with medicines for an extended period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated with an increase in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that association “was not as significant as late as it would be of clinical significance”.
A group of researchers from the University of Adelaide, Australia, launched a study of data for 49,000 pregnant women from the national breast cancer to find out the effects of SSRI on children’s behaviour until 7 years of age.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioral problems.
In 210 of the children treated with SSRI, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to 231 children who were more predisposed to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialization problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more predisposed to bleeding after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born in a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal haemorrhage increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe haemorrhage or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers have said that, although the study linked SSRI to increased risk, there is a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information from researchers on the specific health concerns of women - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at a advanced stage of pregnancy should be the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal haemorrhage, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskiwiak, professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study, it is not recommended that women stop treatment against depression during pregnancy and be closely monitored to reduce the risk of a potential bleeding.
Matthew is accused of murder in the case of the murder of students from the University of Virginia
The man accused of killing students Hannah Graham from Virginia University was charged with murder in the case of a student from Virginia Technical University who disappeared in 2009, the authorities announced March.
The jury in Albemarle, Virginia, brought him to trial on Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33 years old, in Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, the officials say.
Matthew is also accused of rape with the intention of violence.
Each head of charge receives the maximum life imprisonment.
Harrington, aged 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the prosecution brought them relief.
"For six years we've been making decisions and inconceivable in this regard," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm glad to know that, when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences of your fact.
For Jesse Matthew, the domain parts of the consequences began to be buried.
The police say there's a medical-law relationship between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 Fairfax County sexual abuse.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of this last and expected the guilt in this case.
Stay in Charlottesville prison.
Jesse Matthew accused of qualified murder in the case of the death of a student from Virginia University
Harrington was brought to U-Va on October 17, 2009, along with his friends, to a metallic concert.
The group separated when Harrington came out of John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't come back.
Last time he was seen trying to take a taxi around 20:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed with a black triangle with the Panthers.
After her disappearance, Harrington's geeta and mobile phone were found in the arena parking.
Families and friends began an extensive search by Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a professor. Metallics wrote about their disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the trip to Charlottesville was found near an Irr of apartments.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lake, a farm in southwestern Charlottesville.
In the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it's not clear whether that period was over by the date that Harrington disappeared.
The police say that a significant advance in the expulsion of the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were linked to DNA evidence.
The investigators did not make the details of the new evidence that they decided to file Matthew under charges for Harrington's murder.
The defence lawyer Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in the case of Graham, refused to give statements.
The prosecution's announcement comes two days after the completion of a year of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This is similar to the case of Harrington: both were young students who disappeared when they left Charlottesville.
Graham, 18 years old, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a small town near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for a qualified murder in the case of Graham.
In the first days after Graham Toamna's disappearance in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the events and privileges organised for the student who was missing from U-Va.
Harrington says she has been disappointed with her daughter's speculations and criticisms in the media that must be reduced to silence the new charges against Matthew.
"At the same time there have been discussions of the kind "Why did it wear short?" and "And looking for light?" but this kind of question and judge is not valid when it is clear that we have to do it with a traitor on the back of the window," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was sentenced to sexual assault against a young man in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that, one evening in September, while she returned home from the store, a stranger came after her.
He took her to an inverted area, beat her and kicked her in the neck, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought the end had come to me, that I had to cut it forever," said the woman.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her hot on the run, told the woman.
A prosecutor told the jury that it's possible that Matthew might have been afraid of the car's dangers coming into a nearby parking lot.
It was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked it to this case.
Matthew's gonna get the feeling in October.
Matthew will come for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville Wednesday after tomorrow.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said that the most likely Wednesdays will come in Charlottesville and visit the place where his daughter was last seen.
"At least, today I have made a step," says Dan Harrington.

We don't have enough space for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres don't have to appear at the border, because they're more controlled here, migrants are trying to escape, because they're not interested in breaking up in Romania.

"Dorel" mounted the semi-transverse
In Suceava, the workers set up a semaphore with the floor down, so instead of being encouraged to wait 4 seconds longer, the processors receive the "h" message they don't know to decrypt.
It's not right, wherever the whole world passes through the rose, reports the truth.
Every one of them goes like he's got his head.
Two boys were to be taken up in a car because they went through the rose.
"The Rutiera politicians should be here to help, until you get used to the world," said a woman for the source quoted.
The Semaforel was recently mounted in the face of the Rock Mari in the center of Suceve, but the survivors do not seem to take any pity on him, as much as the information received seemed to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by a L, instead of serial 9-8-7.
If "Dorel" is going to do the job as necessary and someone finds himself in charge of getting the deal done, then there would be no more absurdity in this situation.
The chief of the Administration of Strazi and Systematic Rutiera from the First Suceava acknowledged that he was a girl when the semaforor began to function, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We gave it to them, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.

Tsipras, on the Greek drama - why is it in agreement with the third EU agreement?
The reason stated by former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from further austerity and to make a fundamental change in its relationship with the EU's leadership in Brussels.
As a result, the leader of Syria made Greece part of a third defence agreement for this country, which also involves many years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which holds an interview with it.
Now, in fact, Tsipras asks the Greeks to reject their first mandate again, in the context of the elections that he claims they will take their political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the demeaning of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, it clears the possibility of the debt restructuring for Greece," the former prime minister said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described in a strict manner.
"If we knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
This is the view that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the government of the elite, showing that all the financial needs of the territories are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras says that Greece "will certainly need reforms," stating that it must start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for the anticipated elections, in September, after 7 warm months in front of the Athens Executive, during which one third of Greece's rescue forces was approved.

Don't support terrorism anymore!
Syrian President Bashar of Assad gave a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he spoke of refugees and accused the West of supporting terrorists and of "showing" them to immigrants.
"Occident cries for them and the West supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said that this is a passive revolution," Assad said, in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus claims that the omologists of the West say the situation in Syria is also a terrorism of the Islamic state, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president."
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept or forced it as refugees, it's about not dealing with the cause.
If you're pregnant with them, you don't support terrorists anymore.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the entire issue of refugees," added the Syrian leader.
Assad has continued the charges to the Western States and regarding the treatment they have shown to the refugee girl.
It is as the West now cries out for refugees with one eye and takes them into consideration with a second eye munitions, because those refugees have actually stopped Syria because of terrorism, primarily because of terrorists and crimes and the second round because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and the destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the resources of life of the base, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they will be punished somewhere in this world," says Bashar of Assad.
"If we ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding as political forces, whether it is within or outside the government, "it should be settled around what the Syrian people want."
The President of Syria is of the opinion that the dialogue in Syria should continue "to achieve a consensus", which cannot be implemented "as long as we face terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask all the forces to fight against terrorism, because it is the way we can achieve the political goals that we as Syrians want through dialogue and political action," Bashar of Assad said.
This also spoke of one of its allies, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the Ukraine crisis, it was transformed, from a friend of the West, into a demon of it.
Bashar of Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West once again of falsifying the reality in both cases.
Note what happened in the western press after the invasion of Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a Western friend into a demon and was characterised as a latent.
It is represented as a dictator who has removed the opposition from Russia and has reached power through non-democratic means, despite the fact that he has been elected in democratic elections, and the West has acknowledged that the elections have been democratic.
Now, I'm not democratic anymore.
"This is Western propaganda," the leader of Damascus pointed out.
Not at last, it included Russia on the list of such friends - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar of Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbour, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without co-ordinating with the United States and with other Western tariffs".
In addition, Syria's president accused "International Coalition", the leader of the United States, who fought against terrorism: "In fact, when this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State began to expand."
In other words, coalition has gone out and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the West Bank, which provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with terrorism at the same time.
"If these so many are determined to change politics and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in a pocket, it will break you - then we have no intention of cooperating with all these so, given that it is a real and not false coalition, which will fight against terrorism," the leader of Damascus said.
Toamna?
Not a word.
Over 30 Degrees
The weather will be quite warm, especially in the dry season, where temperatures will pass by 30 degrees.
In Bucharest 26 degrees will be registered at noon.
At least two degrees will be on the coast, while all 26 degrees will be announced on the mountain in Brasov.
There will be 21 degrees to Moeceu, 23 to Bran, 23 to the Rece Paraul, 20 to Predeal and 20 to Busteni.

The map of the fairies with the biggest efficiencies and how Romania is
The pollution of oil cuts has caused significant losses in the last year to workers in the extraction of title, energy companies' shareholders and prices that depend heavily on this resource.
It exists and has a positive effect: gasoline has grown enormously.
A combined map of Bloomberg shows that, in October 2014 - July 2015, almost all the 76 prices taken in the calculation dropped at the cost of the fuel.
The most important reduction in pump pressure is seen in Venezuela.
In this tank, the engine worked 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
The opus is found in Saudi Arabia, where the price is fixed by four states.
The cost of the engine varies from row to row, depending on the refining conditions, the changes in the rate, but also the fluctuations in the value course.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg transformed the average price of each state into US dollars.
The Situation in Romania
The Bloomberg data show that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gas gallon (about 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
So, we're ranked 27 at the top of the tower with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this position in the top.
The last quarter of 2014, the gas went out to the Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a decrease of 10.6%.
However, the waves of the circle stand even better.
In Bulgaria, a gas gallon costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans are on the way to the world of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised last night that the federal government would agree to support supplementing the 16 countries of the Federation's accession and distribution of tens of thousands of migrants entering the camps in southern Europe.
After a close 4 hours interview with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel stated that "the most important thing now is to create a ordered and transparent process to make the large number of refugees," notes DPA.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial descendants as well as distribution centres.
"I need such pivot points," she insisted.
The entire team must provide a massive push to make the face of the crisis, added Merkel.
The country's prime minister asked for more help than the 6 billion euro agreed by the federal government coalition for more than a week.
Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Party of Stinga asked for a sum of "the small double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments on a local newspaper.
At the rally or, the prime minister of the country of Renania-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be rapidly integrated into German society.
"We need a national agreement between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that the bureaucracy in the handling of refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Elvetia completed the process in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seahofer expressed similar feelings.
To this day, Bavaria is the hardest port of the population, with most migrants arriving after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a powerful federal actor as head of the Crestin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into a public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual policy of benefits opened at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu scans after the humble infringement with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nerve car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach showed himself totally upset by the arrest, saying that the Sahtior lost his intruder was defavorized.
I said one thing before the game, that I want to be respected.
On the contrary, in the games with the important teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
I'm two different ways.
The new one's got a yellow cardboard right now, while the top teams don't.
In addition, the first sentence was not in any case!
Mingea hit him behind Darijo, without touching his hand.
A game of the same level should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regree that the Arbitrary broke the game," said Mircea Lucescu at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so bad here?"
They were eaten by the wounded husband.
A murder of a sadism from the community threatened the inhabitants of Thargu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, the markets in Türgu Frumos were able to see terrifying scenes near the main market entrance.
In the last three tombers, the killers have been "embedded" by what seemed to be the body of a man.
This was broken, but they lost their head, internal organs, and genetics.
Finally, he had to prove that it was the word of a former officer's body, which was broken by his wife, a professor of geography.
"Fire of Iaşi" has been talking to even the cabimeter who helped the killer, without knowing, at the end of the saxes with the body.
His stories make your hair soft.
The one who warned the police yesterday about the fact that a woman whose three sashes were in a terrible mood after eating from the body was found on the market was a taximeter from the Furmos.
As in American movies, the man helped himself in transporting bags full of human bones, which smelled hard, but without knowing, the crime being a client for a course.
The taximeter reported, exclusively for "The Iron of Iaşi", the shocking scenes he'd done through, helping him without wanting a killer to hide the samples.
This was done with the hands of the dog in which the husband of the professor of geography, who crossed it, found his body.
She came to the Furmos Tower to hide the evidence of the crime as far away from her home in Rome.
Maybe he's got mine.
I didn't know where you were.
She Mihai, as she is known by her friends who practice taximetry in Târgu Frumos, came to see her over the night in the small town where she lives.
This has seen American films all over the world, but never thought he would ever call himself the one who will be the basis for discovering a sad crime, and he will see with his eyes eating flesh.
This tells us that, on the night of the month to March, it is usually expected that car accidents that regularly take place in the area will occur.
This is close to the intersection of roads to Roman and Pascani.
The taximeter reports that the killer woman was observed in a retrovised mirror next to the dogs with the meat dishes supported by the indicator showing the nearby locations.
She came the night with Massaro's course from 1.30.
The car left it at ten meters of the bridge crossing in the Pascani, right at the bar where the mileage is shown.
The bags were rescheduled with the indicator.
After she left the car, I gave her ten meters to the marcher.
I opened the wallet and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Mister, what smells so bad here?"
I saw that she was an old woman, and I told her to help.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the disposal, maybe he's got mine, I didn't know where to know.
I thought he might want to touch someone with that horrible shit.
She's trying to raise a single bag, and I've been able to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified that I should go to the big rock gate, when I took her out of the car," he began telling Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He concluded that the woman did not say anything at all, and, as a result, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't say anything because I was nervous that he put my suit in my car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that he smells worse.
She gave down the bag from the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I got two meters behind to get back, and I realized I can't stay in the car anymore.
I left the wallet open and moved the car back and forth, so that the smell would disappear.
I didn't notice in the car if someone was helped to break the bag because I had the lights in the back and I didn't see it in the glasses.
"There were two plastic bags and a rifle," the man finished.
Seeing the woman's strange behavior, she says she's beginning to lose her curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something wasn't right.
After he gave her the dog down, I went to the hospital, to the Prime Minister, and when I got back, I was especially looking at what the woman was doing with the bag.
She crossed between the bathroom after the wall, where they are and the tunnels inside the market.
Then I left again.
It was a little agile because there was an Italian microwave and a car.
I saw how the woman went to their shoes to try to get in them, to disappear, but probably the shoes didn't want to take it, because they have international courses, and they don't take vacations.
The woman was very aggressive, walking back and forth.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she had done inside.
My uncle answered that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where she was the police patrol, because I've seen her in the past for a while.
I looked for him and found him coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them it was suspicious.
"Then I went to the other side, a course to the Belcești," he completed Mihai.
He told us that the woman became angry after she left the bathroom at the graveyard.
To me, the suspicion left that the bag disappeared, and I was curious what it did to him.
When the police went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and they showed her to me, saying that I noticed she had a suspicious bag.
Then the woman went to the tomb and showed them the bag.
"I came back to the place where he hid the bags around 3 o'clock when I made statements to the police and prosecutors from the place," he concluded the taximeter report.
The prosecutors of Neamț, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old professor Ana Zaharia was surprised by the rooms of a Romanian gas station at 0.55 hours, starting with the three cars.
She arrived at the Frustration at 1.30 p.m.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, who had been married for four years, with a knife, then had him in the house.
The man was called Gheorghe Zaharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday night, the woman put the meat in two plastic bags, which she carried to her car, and hid.
Otherwise, he carried one more, then decided what direction to go, and chose the Bucuresti car - Come out.
Yesterday, prosecutors still didn't know where the wife's internal organs were hiding, nor the genitals.
The head, however, was found raised in the day and pungies, in a detachment from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until yesterday, the prosecutors did not find out from the woman who was the reason he killed her husband with such cold blood and sadism.
The most likely, the professor will be trained mentally, and the body will be examined by legislators, in order to determine officially the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The first took national roads from the municipality's race, after years of this government-run campaign, to be used with money from the national budget, in an electoral campaign of 2004.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL) and, in order to be applied, a decision of the Government must be applied.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a sign because it was in a position to agree with the opinion of the General Banking Plan (PUG).
The first took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any case, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 requires the municipality to take the national roads that are transposing the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads unless the law is respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, the government will also have to be issued following this decision of the Local Council," Prime Minister Mihai Chirica said.
The national roads in the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28-star national road hits Iaşul on the streets: the village of Pácurari, the village of Monteni (the capital), the town of Moara de Foc, the village of Silvestr, the village of Silvestr, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Primaveri, the village of Chišinė, the village of Chišina, the village to the exit of Tomešti - Albizia.
The other national road, DN 24, covers the Bucium, Bd. Socola (up to the semafor), Bucium road (up to the Baza 3), Chişinau Street, Bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, B.C.A. Rosetti and exit to Cárlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Further describing some of Mircea Eliade's youth political sympathies, which, regardless of conviction, would be too large to present the size of a daily article and should be disseminated in a series, worthy, believed, evocated friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most frequent charges used by the Roman-sacrifice dictators.
A less umoral description would be, hopefully, useful in the real debate on which the recent law says "anti-geographical" would be used to alienate it into the Romanian intellectual environment.
Analysing critically the various versions of Eliade's regression in the Law through the Cubului "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin took to the discussion, in the volume Mircea Eliade.
The prison of history (Bucurešti, 2003), another hypothesis, which is at the top of our understanding of the resolution of the epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after the "Balcon scene" was played in Ceauşescu in August of that year.
Based on the documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation, in 1941, documents stored today in the SRI archive (FD, Dosar 573, f.15) as well as a note accompanying from 1938, Florin Üurcano says that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in so-called "Legionary family", a group of intellectuals, especially writers, led by Radu Gyr poets".
As for the Borough of Light there is no verifiable data, since the existence of this "legiation family" is discussed, what must be discussed is, until the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving the SRI's surprisingness to make these secret files available to Mr. Urcano, it is more evident that, at that time, the security tracking was "commandor" Radu Gyr, referring to Eliade, in the context of which Armand Călinescu, the Minister of Internals received the liberty to take all necessary measures to enable King Carol to impose the Royal Decree, suspending the parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legislators who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (the Allied Party for the three countries elected in 1937).
Eliade's arrest was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Uurcano: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, founded in the legal movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr."
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a bureaucratic coverage support for the repression in 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes would have been made at the table for the vast majority of legionists or sympathies in the public space who were to be arrested, but who were to be bound by an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's ol's olographic statement is remembered above, once arrested, in February 1941, after the legitimate rebellion, only to confirm it retrospectively at first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would be interesting to see if more details about the contents of the folder 573 are available.
Was it Elijah's or Radu Gyr's?
Because it must be a document built on the basis of security documents, but then worked for safety to be used either against one or the other.
There is an error here, as is the case with the use of the term "member" of the Mišcari, which only one who knows the acquisition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a pre-marketing stage, of proof, in which it acts as an active sympathizer, found during a three-year trial before becoming "came to be" by law.
In addition, all these forms of secondary organization, such as intellectual clubs or concerts, chairpersons, discussion groups with countries, youth organisations or students around a hill, were his "family", not his own, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of novelty completely escapes the unexploded reader by making Eliade's "member" status (which may be funny) understandable and used to describe political reorganization in the cave.
Of course, calling for subtilities to interpret this kind cannot hide the public activity of the Gárzii support and no clear sympathy for the Captain who encouraged Eliade during the 1935-1940 period, whether in Nae Ionescu's site or not.
The public support of a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean, and the political reorganization itself with so much more than, on a regular basis, intellectuals of this occupation maintain a kind of superiority over activities as an attack and does not go into politics unless they are directly given the privileges.
As far as I could think of Eliade's kind of thinking from that period, in which he was "the leader of the younger generation," I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the ironic rules of a legitimate class.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual descent, however!
To say nothing more than that, in any legitimate "door", what is first is the public activity that is anticipated as well as violence, both requires to be stigmatized, but in the case of Eliade, up to our trial.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence from 1968 - 1969, Mircea Hadoca, an advocate of Eliade, tries to punish Florin's claims (based on some archive documents, even if it was worthy of disseminating and contextualized) with a more controversial argument.
Mircea Hadoca notes in Our volume on Mircea Eliade (București, 2006), that "no line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr does not contain any hints to this framework".
Nor had he been like in 1968, when, once he came out of the communist scenes, Radu Gyr could not have risked any clues in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think she wanted to highlight Mircea Handoca is the fact that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, awe and affection without any doubt about Elijah’s rise.
There's no real idea that Radu Gyr would ever be the leader of Eliade.
Intelligently, the poet is forced to write on the Lord of the Fathers, from the head of the permanent condition of Eliade (which he knew very well what the mission had been doing with the constant denial of the right exile), in signature, after "your old friend" what to expect and is visiblely easy and happy when it responds to his anguish after nearly three decades of separation when "viclean time" has attracted him.
There is no doubt about the fact that, apart from the "mission" with which he was raised (he convinces Eliade that now in New Romania, he could come back at least to see his mother and friends) and that, of course, he fulfills a secret and through short, separated proposals, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows his interest only for literature.
It does not speak of esoteric austerity, of refined political complexity, or of any evocation of youth age in a register other than cultural.
It is difficult to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legitimate line, but until this version was strengthened with less circumstances than Florin's offer, we have in this corresponding memory chips that testify to a mutual value of people who have marked different, but stately, our culture and which, apart from all the trials of life, governs the tone of civilization and interbular education.
Human and cultural documents are important and, why not?, punitive for the strength of friendship and respect to each other beyond the "in time" purpose of the authors.
At the beginning of the 1970s, Eliade finally withdrew from the refugee status of American citizens and, under the pretext of health problems and flood disasters in the country, announced to the RSR authorities, through the embassy (which brings a sporadic correspondence used to get a passport for her sister), that she cannot run the invitation to return to the country.
The following was predictable: it's again on the index, "Toladot business" in Israel, the books sent to families and friends (Fragments of a newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, and she never sees her mother again.
Among the friends of the country, only Noica has a sporadic correspondence, although, surprisingly, as a personal record from Chicago, many private persons or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr no longer received permission to write it after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceauşescu regime tried the second operation to convince Eliade (by official invitations, Noica's duties, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr has already passed through the neighborhood.
New coach, foreign player
As a result of the fall in autohone volleyballs, Penicilina Iași was tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exhibits participate in training tournaments under the command of trainer Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year from Division A1 of women's volleyball, Penicillin Iași has kept its place in the first stage due to withdrawal and then defining the formation of the Miroslava Science, recently promoted in the first stage after a barajna tournament even discussed in the exit community.
The news took little by little the drive out of the group, which remained without main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, reaching second to Bacau Science) and many missing players, some delays such as Cristina Lung and the free Diana Studeneanu, or left, as Ana-Maria Berdil (at the campaign Volilei Alba Blì) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Ficá.
Fires, until the start of the campaign scheduled on October 10, there was and there was more time to complete the battalion.
Previously, a new trainer was found in Dan Gavril's person, from the team of LPS Piatra Neamț, who has been working for the past few years at Penicilina, which is about to sign a contract with the team led by the Far East Vasile.
Then two players were brought from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconița, being tried and some foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, almost transferred by the Swedish player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and the Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline battalion led by Dan Gavril performed a singing in Gura Humoru, after participating in a tournament held at Lugoj and equipped with the Cup of Banatu, in which the achievements have won a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
The following week, from 23 to 25 September, Penicillin will take part in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new champion we're trying to build a valuable team.
We have a professional coach and experience, but the player fund in Romania is quite low and therefore we will appeal to foreign volunteers, especially after deciding that the teams can use an unlimited number of players outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports from clubs in Romania.
"We were hoping to reach the end of the competition year at the 5-6 places, even if it would be very difficult," said ACS President Penicilina Iași.
It's an exciting meeting.
Men gathered after nearly 70 years
George Krzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69 years old, were born at the end of the Second World War, in Germany, after their mother of Polish origin had just been released from a labor camp.
Because she was too sick to care for them, the demons were sent to Poland to adoption, the two brothers being so separated not only from what gave them life, but also from one another.
For ten years George and Lucian did not know anything about the celestial existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents showing that he was adopted and that he has a brother.
In the 1960s, she asked the Red Cross to help her find her brother, but they found no trace to lead her to Lucian.
Early in 2015, thanks to the program , Restauranting Family Links" of the Red Cross, the gemen met again, and the moment was more than emotional.
BBC reporters have been surprised by this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought home four medals from Stuttgart to sports
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze were won by children from Germany Open Championship from Stuttgart, an international sports competition organised by the German Federation of Dance Sports and the World Federation of Dance Sports.
From Iași there were five parties that were trained at the Dance Energy Club and had played with 9,000 sportsmen from 20 countries.
The 10 children left participated in five different categories (Young People Ask... on 2 June 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pearls: Răzvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Târzianu (two medals of gold and silver), Vlad Constantin Donoza and Otilia Žtefana Gologan (Bronz medal).
And three others have succeeded in occupying the front seats: Bogdan Stelian Duminica and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad One and Antonia Ioana Josub Cujbă and not the last one on Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionița.
As an coach, I wanted enormously to confirm the results achieved in March this year, this confirmation is necessary for both us and sportsmen, as far as their future evolution is concerned.
The fact that we were able to hear the novel of Romania twice this year at German Open and to return home with four medals gives us tremendous joy and hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its sportsmen at a much higher level.
"All of this would be only possible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and very much work," said Andrea Ramona Manolache, the teacher of the children of the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented in this year by 34 clubs from the country, which is getting a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country at 4 of the 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Iaşi.
6 ways to relieve stress in a minute
A little bit of us let us run a weekend up the mountain to escape stress.
Some of us have time, other financial resources, and both of us are under ban.
There's so much the demand for anyone who wants to escape some stress.
These do not involve any high costs and no special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day-to-day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we treat them and how we treat them.
Instead of going into the inside and feeling like an implosion has a place in your mind, you better try the next relaxation tactics that didn't take you more than a minute.
Breathe alanc
Respiratory exercises are not intended solely for yoga soloists or practitioners.
He works for any man in part, and regulating breathing at a time tense helps release endorphine in the body, a process that leads to a restful state, informing Livestrong.
Be a child
We know we've gone too long for the kids, and we're not allowed to get out of here when we have our boss.
But that doesn't mean that we can't go to a office seat corner or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the roof) and don't type as much as we have the flames.
You can get rid of nerves and negative energy accumulated during a day with some healthy collections.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation calls for a replication during a psychotherapy session, but I didn't give up on psychology.
Imagine a beautiful place, which inspires us with calmness and calmness of the sun’s fury, can lead to the slowing of the old nerves.
It is, in fact, self-sustainment, a procedure that can actually change lives, both in good and in bad.
It's all up to what we're supposed to do.
The best thing is to look at ourselves at an indical place that's freezing our soul.
Listen to music
Put your pants in your ears and listen to rest music.
Attention, it's not the word of music that's preferred, because if it's the word of heavy metal, you might get into heavy trouble with rest.
Listen to even relaxation melodies, which are lined and do not contain verses, to rule the balance at the time your child opened.
Decojit or portocal
It's strange the advice to deduce a bottle in the nerves?
Well, it's not!
This is not the word of fruit in itself, because it does not contain a substance of miracles or Xanax to decompose us completely (occupational, too complete).
It's about aroma therapy!
The smell of Portuguese coji, during the decoy, stimulates the brain to produce endorphine, a hormone of good old age.
Mangaie an animal
Those who have animals near, whether it's the word of the house, or the word of the one who's sitting around the place of work, take a few seconds to drive him.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, animal management can reduce blood pressure.
hour and rock with violet and guitar
Two lovers of instruments like rivals, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous parts of the Roman folklore combined with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We have found us, and since then it has made us very happy to sing together, having an unlimited practical repertoire."
We thought this was the moment that a vicar with a guitar was invented.
Cristi: "From the first moment on we realized that what we sang was very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned from the passage from the cell repertoire and, what is very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there is a gap between classical music and the rest."
I think many people can listen to classical music.
And in the second row we stole a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the point between generations, we want to offer a kind of music that could make only those who listen to classical music listen to and rock, and those who listen only rock get to love them and classical music.
And I was surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they'd listen to something like that and they'd like it.

The Levites from Iaşi were more involved in traffic than at school on the first day after vacation
Hundreds of people came out yesterday morning "captiv" in hell traffic from more areas.
The Prime Minister announced that today it is closed to the Mangeron bulevar (plass Bahlui left), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
Prime Ministers have failed to respect the promises of carrying out work for the smoothing of traffic once in the beginning of the school year.
One of the insurance granted to the municipality, at least twice in the last week, was in the restoration of the grid of the International Land Area.
However, only a few elements of the interim were to be installed, and the last time of the work was the end of the last week, yesterday the shooting was not carried out.
The blacks of the victims were at the top of Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, bearing in mind that another Prime Minister's promise was violated: the shift of the Vamal activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "to the end of August", in the context of which the transfer is still under discussion since 2012.
Presently, Prime Minister Mihai Chirica says the problem of the International Gara is more complicated.
The movement will be made at the right time, we need to take account of the movement of traffic in the area, we need an opinion from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where it's time for the tramway to stay in the grid, but we'll solve it in some way," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to this, would be the stop of the tramway with a semaphore before screaming.
The problems in circulation were also in the section of the Red Podu.
The code of cars on the road the Holy Laszar was extended to the SRI seat.
"I've waited a good minute to get out of Podu Roș," said one out.
Through Podu Roș, it was necessary to move around to the CUG in September if the project "Sud functional Art Rehabilitation and Rehabilitation" was completed in the initial implementation period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complete at the beginning.
"I have withdrawn European funds for new jobs, for example overtime, on the initial variant of the Nicolina pass was August," Chirica commented.
The most recent time for the reintroducing of the trawls is October.
During the day of yesterday, exits have reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Pácurari, the Centre (Cucu Square, Independence, the Armenian Road) or the intersection of Base 3.
The admony could come back as chief at CJ.
In the morning you'll know for sure.
The Court’s judges will decide tomorrow if the suspended President of the Judiciary Council maintains judicial control and prohibitions.
The judges of the Iaşi Court resolved a new term in the "Album" document yesterday, in which the accused is also the suspended President of the Iaşi Judici Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to speak in the morning on the judicial control measure currently imposed against the Admonition.
This latter wants to take place or withdraw this measure, which is held away from CJ's headquarters for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if this will be kept fresh and by the Supreme Court, Cristian Admonition will be able to determine its role as President of the CJ.
The adjudicate was sent to court by the National Anti-Discrimination Directorate (DNA), accused of favouring the author and intellectual errors after saying to the Cororians, it would have been tried to mask an audit check after which a number of irregularities regarding receipts from a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co would have been detected.
The Ombudsman would have tried to hide the fact that the institution which led it would not have received any further promotional material from the Court of Justice of Iaşi, although in writing these materials appeared to be received by CJ.
In addition to him, justice and three directors of the CJ, but also Laser Co's administrator.
Another 3,500 exits are expected to vote until 25 September
The first is ready to distribute further issues if the 12,000 will be exposed.
The exits have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the teas on the Åtefan of the Sea.
According to municipal officials, some 8,500 of the 12 000 questionnaires distributed at the centre of the city and in three other additional points (Copou park, planned by Alexandru del Bun and Primaria).
A record came out Sunday in front of the Prime Minister.
According to the representatives of the Civic Group, "Iash loves you," 530 outlets voted in 140 minutes, respectively, almost four votes expressed each minute.
Instead, throughout the day of the month, about 440 people came out in the same place.
The Group's volunteers say that many exits announce the notification and the people are ineffective in public consultation.
As a result, they made a yesterday call to Internet users to print a display of information on the group's availability and to put it in block boxes.
The volunteers also showed that at the additional point in the Copou Park the last form was completed by Sunday exits.
We'll offer the form from the archives, where it's not too complete.
"The possible additions will be made when all the 12,000 forms will be completed," said municipal spokesman Sebastian Buraga yesterday.
"Scrotch noirs" will end on 25 September, and if the majority vote of exits is in favour of the replanting of the shoes then the Prime will plant your silver in this tonne.
The guests can express their opinion at the centre of the archives in Dcia, Fruitosa, Fathers, Nicolina and Pacuri, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.
The leaders of the Prime Minister decided to shut down the Wall Street at the beginning of 2013, an action that had resulted in an increase of 60,000 municipal lei.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without the consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civil group "Iash loves you", an online community that covers about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civil replanting group was signed by over 9,100 supporters until evening.
RECORD of married students at USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in the year I
The university has 920 students this year in the year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ion Ion Ionescu de la Brad" explained that this year were the most successful candidates ever from the history of higher education institutes from the beginning.
We are very grateful for the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of admitted students in the history of the university, about 920 students in the first year. We've never exceeded that number.
"We've also had higher average candidates, we've occupied the budget positions at the license and master," said Prof. Dr. Ioan zeneu, a prosecutor responsible for educational activities.
This has made it more clear that the university has met a considerable number of students at the rate, with 20% of the respective places, a significant figure greater than in other years.
Although the results have also been published on the Romanian language study lines, the continuing admission to the English study programme from the University of Veterinary Medicine, which has won 50 competitions, with a rate of EUR 5,000, and is now expected to respond to the Minister for the confirmation of students' files and the necessary study visas.
At the tone session, 120 files were deposited at 14 budgeted locations and 209 out of competition in "co tax" in the licensing studies.
Most of the files were from the Faculty of Agriculture, number 75, Horticulture was 23, and Zootehnia, 22.
At the master session, 18 files were delivered, at 150 places on the tax proposed by USAMV, seven of them on Agriculture, five on Horticulture and six on Zootehnie.
The victims are afraid to enter the car wheels in the top of Tudor Vladimirescu
The village over Bahlui from the Tudor Vladimirescu bulvar stayed as quiet as when "The Iron of Iaşi" wrote about the problems it presents, at the end of 10 days.
Our daily report then pointed out that on the axis that delimites the two senses of walking the asphalt has been left, showing deep groups, some even 20 centimetres, where concrete plays that represent the primary infrastructure of the pot are seen.
Also, the asphalt began to cool off on one side and on the other side of the axis, prior to setting signs that the lungs will rise.
At the same time, Prime Minister Mihai Chirica states that the pot has no structural problems, having recently been made a technical expertise, in order to delay a project to rehabilitate the pot and one of the trawls, with a value of EUR 5 million.
The first Chirica states that the area affected by fissures and groups will be signaled, following rapid recovery of the asphalt.
The only measures taken so far have been the installation of small and signalling tapes, without even a simple pumping.
During this period, we have focused more on opening schools and the necessary work for this purpose.
"It's a point-of-the-spot expert we're waiting for about a week with the necessary details of the intervention, considering that in the most two weeks we can go through the improvement of the situation," the prime minister said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know if I'm happy or I'm left with melancholy; I'm tired, I'm sick, to the second.
First, because I feel like they've only been three weeks, not three years since I took it for the first time, emotionally, to the grade.
Although it is easy to give up, neither a normal parent is happy that their children are growing up.
Secondly, because I remember the same day from my childhood, it started a story that didn't end until today.
I wasn't even what's usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I'd say.
But I always liked school.
So much, I chose to continue to practice it, even if as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy mission.
And no one with a month off.
That's because, like all of us, I've given over the whole class of teachers: better or worse, more sympathetic or insupportable, smarter or right-handed.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are people with other rooms in this bridge.
I think these are toxic, because it relieves enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form himself.
I've had the luck of giving, as long as I was a student or a student, over a few, a few, a few, exceptions.
These meetings can be decisive if they take place at the right time.
Who believes that the role of the cathedral is the base of the transmission of some information is amarnic.
This can do it to anyone; of course, you can tell the student very well by yourself, that we are only living in the time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, models the mind of the students.
He's making them, he's making them think.
Staying in the cathedral is not a privilege, as I think it is enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very motivous, they are demanding, insensitive, and always willing to look for the hives of those ahead of them.
That's how old they are, the temperature.
As a teenager, we all thought we knew everything, that we had convincing assurances of everything.
When we mature, we come to understand that we have nothing but doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to get him out of his self-sufficient category and make him think.
I mean, he's supposed to doubt himself, ask himself questions.
Find out your own answers, either them or the future.
To involve yourself in all that he does.
To lead him discreet to useful models.
It's very difficult, especially that most of the times the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
The one who just waited for him to take his feet wrong to punish him.
But, that corrects him, the innocent, rebellious, to live in full age, to look at him from the cathedral with suspicion.
That he just doesn't have the natural way to accept his attempt to order him.
Adolescents are not allowed to play at the point, they are not allowed to impose restrictions.
Or, if I imagine I'm doing it, they'll argue something.
And, of course, when a strong person is found in the cathedral, which is imposed by a long and uncommunicative nature, the students are at war with the given object.
They're thousands of teenagers who miss meetings with the great writers of the film, because of the lack of touch by the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a data insight, that mathematics is all that can be more obsessive for their incomprehensible mind.
I always tell my students: if you give it to a teacher you don't hire, who doesn't know how to communicate as from man to man with you, don't let him separate you from literature to whom you should be directed.
How did it happen to me that I became the doll myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He opened my mind to some of the texts that have been speaking to the audience since then on his understanding.
I've already met a university professor who opened my library door.
I looked at him as a man from another world: he had lost his house covered with broken paper scraps.
I was lost in his library, and I wanted to have one the same.
Now I might have it, but, if I hadn't taken my sister off the road, I might have decided to make a football player.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or anyone else knows what.
I don't think that kind of meeting is a coincidence.
I don't believe in gambling.
It's essential that you give over to the man who will take you by hand and direct you slowly to his own voice.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience helps me to discuss just what it means to give the literature.
It's just that the literature can't be passed.
There's no literature teacher, just like there's a math teacher.
How do you make the infamous concept?
You can, at the most, approach him without claiming to convey petrified truths.
The one in the cathedral can be the most guided reading, that's something else.
But especially you can apply some wonderful meetings, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open their mind, that can lift them up, someone's talking, tears in their eyes.
Therefore, the literature teacher must first succeed in making students understand (if they feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
Opposite!
A great thing, Al. Paleologu, says one thing just seemed paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not inverse!" and he was right.
That's why a good desk prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in any open area.
Happily, we've always learned a lot.
And we, professors; or especially us, professors.
Most of the time, it only repeats a great truth: not only the students have learned from their masters, but also the opposite.
In an ideal way, the teacher should be a teacher and a murderer.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
I'll find him at least, he's right.
But the master was the one who opened the stage.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a professor than to stand up for so many of such divisions.

FIFA is being searched throughout
U.S. Justice and Switzerland will lead to new arrests
American and Swiss authorities have announced that criminal penalties will begin in the case of new persons and organizations, in the context of the investigation of FIFA corruption, inform the international press.
American Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, in a press conference organised in Zurich, that the world football corruption investigation had been expanded.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional penalties to the address of new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, more FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been expelled from the United States.
"We hope that other people who follow the criminal will reach the U.S.," Lynch added.
Elvezia's Attorney General, Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, stated that the institution has deposited more goods, including housing and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the research carried out in collaboration with the USA.
"We haven't reached the end of the first rehearsal," said Lauber.
So far, a very large amount of information has been confiscated, 11 terabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are investigated.
In the interest of researchers, there was also a contract for the award of media rights at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and in 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a major scandal of corruption, after the U.S. court has accused 14 people, with two Vice Presidents FIFA and seven officials of the forum.
The detained persons are researched to take advantage of and receive other uses from the early 1990s and so far, totaling over $150 million.
As a result of this scandal, Elvet Joseph Blaster announced, at the beginning of July, that he was resigning from the FIFA President’s office, after he was real for the fifth time.
Battle as a movie at the theater
In Gale Supekombat from Milan, the outpost of Cătálin Moroșanu will fight with "the beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" of Cătálin Moroșanu, will take part, on October 2, in the Supercombat Gala from the Linear 4 Ciak of Milan, the last before the end of November, is shown in a communication message MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we'll be back in this tunnel with a new five-star gallery.
If we've always chosen a place to play, a theater, then we promise to fight like a movie.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
Along with the games with already dedicated views, we will have another gallery open, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Roma Cristi Speccu, Christian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"It will soon be announced and the full programme will be announced," said promoter Eduard Iriaa.
Catalin Moroșanu will fight under the Supercombat World Grand Prix Final Eradication with American James Wilson, after he participated in the last pyramid in the hard-organized category in Japan and numerous awards from the bodybuilding contests.
I'm just waiting to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's a real animal, but I hate him!
I'm still angry that last year I couldn't finally fight, so now I'm going to fight him.
"The animal turns it into a psyche," said Moroşanu.
As of 2015, the Andrei and Bogdan Stoica brothers will have the last confrontations in Italy before fighting for world titles on 7 November at the end of the sea.
Last year, both of them were implicated by KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the scenario.
I'm glad I'm back in Italy, the atmosphere last year was incredible.
"I just hope to meet the fans there again and promise them a new show of newitt," said World Championship Andrei Stoica.
Milano will also fight Raul Cătinaş with an opponent who will be set up.
A girl invited the Queen of England to her day, but she assured her in writing
A British girl sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to take part in her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for her longest lady, but she did not forget to mention that she was not allowed to visit her family in Buckingham Palace, when she went to visit her family.
The writing has not remained empty, but the girl has received an answer from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but asked her and apologized that she could not be present on September 27, because she even hated to entertain her family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Páunescu were invited together to a talkshow shortly before the poet Adrian Páunescu died.

Happily, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the speaker and the brightness of the car was divided.

A Syrian artist turned Super Mario into a refugee
A Syrian artist has created a version of the popular game "Super Mario", which recalls the difficult situation of his partners, on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Ciupers, the modified video game focuses on the Mario Refugee.
The person is trying to move from trafficking in persons and border police, on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses the Samir al-Muffti pseudonym for security reasons and declared that he performed the video game with the Mario refugee after his friends had arrived on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of the war.
At the Craiova Detention Centre, the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I
Justice Minister Robert Cazancious said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Centre, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in Class I, and the largest is 25 and is in Class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I have chosen to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Administration of Prisoners to try to attract attention, and in this way, on less-known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in Class I, and the largest is 25 years old and is enrolled in class XI.
"There are complex subjects that society is concerned about discussing at this moment, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we do not have to go through with the lesson that these over 100 young people from the Craiova Detention Centre offer," said Minister Robert Cazanicum, at the opening ceremony of the school year.
The Ministry of Justice drew attention to the fact that lack of education, motivated in many cases by lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, stating that young people in this centre would have a different chance in life if they could have followed the high school course of any child, if they had the opportunity not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to respect the law and what consequences it might have had.
"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate people who have violated the law, to shut them behind high walls, and to try to rehabilitate and prepare them, so that when they return to the community they have more opportunities to reintegrate," Cazanic added.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investment must be made and in the penal system, because, in many cases, detention conditions are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and personnel, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and because of this partnership, every year in the prison system, there are more than 2000 graduates of school education courses.
Of course, we won't be able to change over the night that hasn't been 25 years, but it's important steps we do.
"In all these times we need and support from society, and this support can only come if we prove that we are committed, that these young people at your job have a chance and do not pose a threat to society," Cazanic said.
The Ministry of Justice hated both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Highness of the Holy Cross, I would invite all the students and teachers to visit the Mausoleums from Sweden, March and not only, to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," said Robert Cazanic.

Doctoral schools have two crying schools to be downgraded!
Request for university students from Iaşi and the country
More than 200 researchers, academics, personalities and students from the country signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academy of Education and Research asking the Ministry of Education and Research to evaluate, punish and even defeat medical schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
The candidate signatories launched on 10 September are also listed as educational frameworks and teachers in Iaşi.
Through the university signatories of the academic environment, it is, for example, Prof. Livius Antonese.
At the national level, the petition has names from the various ministers of education, such as Mircea Miklea, to people of culture who are and educational frameworks of university, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Act provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this fact has not yet been carried out, so that there are no specific sanctions for doctoral schools which clearly violate the ethical rules of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," states the initiative.
This request specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right to function for any doctoral school in which more than two complaints have been found, until the assessment and correction of the situation.
The last requirement is to suspend the right to work for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral directors provided for by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Research Council in 2011 for the eligibility of projects of type IDEI.
Do you respect less a general without a doctor, or a politician, or an information agent in the Middle East?
"Why is there no other colleges in Europe that will provide doctors with secret services, and senior soldiers who give their doctor a degree to the autonomous academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, the founder of the petition, the original and she from Iaşi.
This can be completed by all lovers on the Society's website, and final signatures will be issued by the Ministry of Education and Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "Pentru Iaşi" party, founded by young political non-philanthropic IT managers, was launched alternates in the Copou Park.
The President of the "Pinru Iaşi" Initiative Group held an interview with "The Fire of Iaşi"
The island will have a dedicated party exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of non-political entrepreneurs and managers so far launched at the end of the last week of the Party for Iaşi organisation that will propose candidates to the local elections in 2016.
Now, the party's core is a form of IT specialists, but the training initiatives say that in the organisation are welcome to all people who want to participate in modernising the city.
The launch took place on Saturdays, in Copou Park, and the event involved over 200 sympathetic people, almost all being young.
The special invitation to action was Nicoşor Dan, President of the Association Save Bucharest.
He was surprised at the 2012 local elections, when, from the independent position, he was able to raise 10% of the votes of the participants for the capital's primary role.
"The people I've seen at "Pentru Iaşi" think they're very good to access the public administration of Iaşu".
I believe in this initiative, I think there are chances, I think there may be more chances in a community than in Bucharest.
"You'll always be with "Pentru Iaşi," said Nicușor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Yaşi to work in an IT foreign company?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more emotional and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, I've been living a year in Cluj.
I've come back every time, 'cause I feel like this is my house.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to establish a political party?
Andrei Postolache: Now that we have reached a certain age, we are a group of people who have started to know us for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could be involved.
At first, we were more concerned, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, with various charitable or charitable actions, and, somehow, things evolved natural and organic and now it happened to be the moment we reached the decision that we must involve more than that.
ZDI: Name three specific projects to enhance the activities of local public administration!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum awareness of the primary activity so that different departments, institutions and regions cooperate better.
But, more importantly, to be able to publish transparent data on the activities outlined in detail: bugs, reports, projects, etc. We speak of information organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular library, it is important to public consultation of affected people.
If we speak of efficiency, we must not forget transport in general, we have the worst buses in the country.
You have to buy a medium of new transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city is very much.
How did you promote Iaşul?
Andrei Postolache: You're on the plane and you're looking for investors from this world.
There are conferences, industrial events in which you can "sell" the city.
You must want to do this and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we bring customers to Iaşi.
ZDI: What's the iron of Iaş?
Andrei Postolache: My father is that we must be a city of technology, in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go to medicine, enter the robotic area, in 3D printing, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I'm referring here to the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iaşu already has a historical brand that must not be changed, that is, cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organizing, planning, communicating, people's business and project disposal.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not online party.
We don't want to have "willers" brought with the bus.
That means we're based on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there's enough people like this.
ZDI: The first Iaşu should be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary that the air of concern be in constant writing?
Andrei Postolache: No one else works.
First of all, you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make the known city, if you don't bring money into the city, at a time you'll stay without money and you won't be able to do, for example, crazy.
You have to do both at the same time and you need competent people around you.
The Prime Minister doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the primer's model, which comes and beats with the powder in the table and solves everything.
No, no, no.
We're a team.
The first is the coordinator of a orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can support the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an innocent reputation, to be clear integrity and to be honorable.
From this point of view, we have no other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview performed by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache works in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015 Introspecials established the company, after seven years he was the director of the Endava International case (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
The other four years (2003 - 2007) spent them at Syngy.
The company which established it along with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rabla treatment program proved to be a failure
The Director-General of SC IRU SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, stated that the encouragement programme of the national park for processing and agricultural machinery, launched in 2011, named and Rabla for processing, was a failure due to the bureaucracy.
As regards the Rabla programme, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it has proved to be a mistake, because the documentation was very workable and complicated for a farmer of a range, and the approvals were too long and the world was abandoned.
That program made it possible to sell something to 10 pieces.
"The need for treatment for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 cows," said Mircea Oltean.
According to this, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces a few hundred annual treaties, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by foreign companies, who know the needs of the Romanian markets.
It's a very big competition with those who come out, all world producers have put their eyes on Romania, I know these things I told them, and they have special policies.
"All the delay is great agglomeration, all the exposed producers come with all kinds of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who stressed that IRUM Reghin produces annually around 500 agricultural and forestry treatment.
Through the Rabla treatment programme, which started in 2011, those who owned old and other self-propelled treatments, such as combinations, could fly and received a valuable 17,000 mark instead.
The red dragon has grown.
The internal writing of the labs seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader becomes automatically his senior in the future elections.
You're raised, so, the rose-aprins/ Under his shoulders we're going to live and die.
That's what he sang last night, Jeremy Corbyn in the village of Sanctuary House.
It has witnessed many facts and assurances/ Let's not change the color now.
Readers who don't know the melodic line of this unofficial British and international left-wing stage (The Red Flag) can search the Internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With the heads discovered, let's swear with all of them that we'll wear it until we're done.
The author is not only an admirer of the red streets (and not those flying them), but he respects the democratic political traditions that are built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn will be able to catch the left of the morning with the morning, this story of love between him and the base of the Laburist Party will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think that's going to happen, but I think it's too late to talk about the sea and the inevitable electrical collapse, over five years, of an alternative leader.
Now, however, we can refer to the procedures: we have attended a democratic exercise of an impressive celebration.
Not British volunteers have invented the direct voting system for the party leader, on the left side of the western side.
For several years, French socialists have developed a more complex system, based on motivations, which allows all members and sympathetic people to express themselves; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for appointment of the candidate to the president of 2012.
However, the internal survey of labs seems more spectacular and more significant political, since the new elected leader becomes automatically his senior in future elections.
It is, of course, and a matter of political system, the personalization of power is more pronounced in the British Sea than in the other part of the Canal of Manecia.
In addition, the participation in the vote was large in all three "search": self-researched members, union members and other associated organisations of the party and, finally, the Group of Sympathetics (which received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This last group provides us with interesting information on the perceptions of left-wing segments of British society, particularly those formed by young people or middle-aged, educated, interested in political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to engage more, in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are no sociological research to tell us too much about the attitudes of this "external search" laburist, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we meet some similar attitudes to those of the Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with note that they will cross the traditional channels of the left.
If we have to identify a "antisystem" call, it is first reflected by the rejection of the centralist line, New Labor (for many, only a dissimulated form of that ulletism).
The second component would be the reputation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they didn't go to the left, that they didn't stand firm in the time of Tony Blair.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestively - is offered by the recent reference to the independence of Scotland.
If we extract the separatist message and concentrate strictly on the aspirations of other political topics, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energy of positive public segments of the social state and encouraged the aspirations of justice, adapting to disarmament and military intervention forces on the street, but always sensitive to the new themes of left: ecology, gender, assistance for the poor countries.
The Scottish labs have thus lost a elector who, at least in principle, should have a privileged access, but who can now recover it (see their enthusiasm towards Corbyn's campaign).
The same energy exists in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership could not attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his voice outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, "aristocrat" laburist.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I believe, rather than the left-hand anti-system of the southern European environment.
The "antisystem" term is too hard: "anti-setting" seems more appropriate to me.
Until next week we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first step, as the leader of the opposition.
We'll see if there's no red Steagull going to fall in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader is taking over his place, in the front of the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn wants now from his colleagues in Parliament is in first place - and in this regard he has reason to be concerned.
Capcan of manipulating with or without knowledge
While I wrote the article, I went through the head to check online the story of the former warrior and "commander Sirian Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin's person "Leith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the start of circumspect).
I didn't do it.
In the article last week (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in the parallel two places - the one with the young Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean valley and the one, in fact: the two occupying the Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a warrior, the second time as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh has been taken from the article "Serie Syrian fighters come with the valley of refugees" (named by Viorica Marin in the truth of September 3rd).
Last night, I put a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among others, a piece of bread from the friend (not just from the FB) Marius Cristian: "Subscribe, rather than a quote. Laith of Saleh is not a juhadist".
On the contrary, he's Al Assad's opponent, for democracy and the same.
"That you could add and manipulate the grosol in the table."
I've got to admit, I've got a feeling of relief.
As soon as I wrote the article, I went through the head to check online the story of the former warrior and "commander Sirian Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin of his "Laith Al-Saleh driver" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could themselves make me from the start of circumspect).
Because I had faith in the truth, in his journals.
On the contrary, I had no comment on the drawing of food from Marius Cristian rather than, "I need to do so if I had (a) believed in the Adevar"
After that, I've obviously taken the money off the story and I'm grateful to the readers with the correct presentation of the Syrian story Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest we found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader sections Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeking Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphititis and Dalton Bennett of August 17, 2015 on the island of Kos, Greece, where they noted, through the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man who is trying to order the chaos of the crowd.
The man was the Syrian suffocator Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "was used to be in command," since "he led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We further find that Al Saleh, aged 30, was charged with "a house, a wife and a normal life before the war began that cost more than 250,000 lives and placed a third of the Syrian population on the streets."
In an interview with the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells us that "all the world wants to leave Syria".
My home is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70 percent of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (a extremist group of Islamic states), the government wants me to fight against everyone.
Instead of being thrown out of an island supermarket, Kos would have been offered "a more intimate meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a moonist from government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we find that Laith (which is called leu in Arabic) was, in fact, on the way to the Netherlands, where he has a truth - he was a senior officer in the Syrian army and then he became a rebel and came to the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get there and then his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (closely old with the civil war in Syria, which started in March 2011).
After this, Laith Al-Saleh would not have been excluded from a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by Russians), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, allied Al-Qaeda.
A fool - who wants freedom has to fight in Syria, not one enemy alone, but three!
I gave more than a Serbian material on August 22, which I did not understand very much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come together with migrants: THRIJU MIGRANTIMA calls the title of a message from http://www.telegraph.rs/ves, in which I are added a post with Al Saleh with a barbage holding a Syrian steag in hand and that of the refugee in which the triangle with "THANK YOU".
On September 7, then, on the BBC website, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation with the help of the Syrian fighter: This viral photo fake claims to show an IS fighter posing as a refugee - This viral post wrongly claims to set up a fighter of the Islamic state knowing refugee.
We find that the poem (in fact, the poems - the Laith with the beard and the gun and the THANK YOU triangle) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would have been and would have asked for forgiveness between time.
Only before that, just on his walls, the picture with the two places would have been cut over 70,000 times, adding a few thousand comments.
That's what you're talking about, too late, the horse's gone!
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took over the story with the manipulation of BBC, but he mistranslated the title: "A fake photo became a viral show of an ISIS fighter on his right to refugees."
Obviously, not the photograph is false, but interpretation was a false, wrong, short, manipulative.
21 - year - old champion
Winner in Iaşu Raul, Simone Tempestini assured the national title of the race, becoming the youngest in the history of the campaign
Iasu Cotnari 2015 finished with a wonderful result of young pilot Simone Tempestini, an Italian with a Romanian citizen, who won all the new special tests of the most difficult stages of the National Railway Championship.
