Seminars against the prosecutors: The Cassation of the former Vice-President of Tartu will be discussed on 4 August
This means that the decision on it will be made, most recently, at the beginning of September.
The courts of the first two institutions rejected the request for a hearing, but in April its appeal was filed by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complainant ' s complaint because it did not enter into its jurisdiction.
The court ruled that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during the criminal proceedings.
“Relative such matters is to be dealt with by the prosecutor and the court of departure,” the ERR Press Secretary of the Tartu Court, Anett Creetsmann, explained earlier.
In her statement, Valvo Semilarski appealed to the District Court, which did not alter the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now you have to say the Lord.
According to the lawyer of Semilarski, a lawyer, Olivier Nies, his client had been unjustly suspected of being outlawed for about two years.
He now requires the prosecutor to refute false claims in his address and replace him with moral damage.
The reason for the complaint in court was the complaint made by the Special Prosecutor of the Luna District Prosecutor Margus Grossa in October 2017 when Semilarski, together with others at the time, was detained by the Vice-President of Tartu Artem Suvarov, for suspected of committing several crimes.
"We remember that when I was arrested, the security and prosecution police immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local self-government bodies, were sold.
These airborne public suspects followed me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the prosecutor is not willing to say anything about them," Semilarski commented early in August 2019.
According to Olivier Niesa, the prosecutor attended the press conference outside the legal framework in which the prosecutor was to act.
"The claim of receipts and sales has been false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its resolutions on Russia and Lithuania that, at the stage of the election of representatives of the State, the suspects should be careful not to be represented in the role of the offenders before the trial.
The prosecutor is also bound by the premise of innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said Nees.
“The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a hostage in circumstances where facts on the basis of suspicion are yet to be found to be unacceptable is that it is not acceptable to disagree with the assumption of innocence and unjust treatment of the complainant,” the lawyer added.
As wrote by Rus.err.ee, former Vice-President Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held responsible for the prosecution of the appeal - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former officer was accused of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions in particular large amounts.
According to the charge, during the period 2015-2017, the former Vice-President of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city administration meetings in making decisions relating to the companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or leaders whose seminars were active at the external level.
According to Grossa, in all of these cases, the Semilarski had personal interests and therefore had to refrain from taking part in the decision-making process.
Previously, as wrote by Rus.err.ee, the prosecutor had voiced the Semilar ' s suspicion of receiving and violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions in particular large amounts.
This occurred in October 2016 when he was detained along with another deputy, Mr. Artem Suvarov (Central Party).
The prosecutor and the security police then stated that there was strong evidence against both of the two officers.
After that, the two officers were dismissed.
The case of Suvarov was later brought to court, which had completely justified the policy.
The case of Valvo Semilarski is still pending.
The ex-solicist of the "Uphands" group visited the Tverska area
The ex-solist of the " handed-over" team, and now the sole executive, businessman and actor Sergei Jukov, has posted an official photo account from the Calais Tever district.
Photo posted yesterday, Saturday, 25 July.
"I'm gonna put my hands up under the new "Crosque" and give you a drink and fresh air!
Write your comments, what time is it in your city?
We've got no rain today, but more than +20 until it's up," says Jukov.
The singer is likely to breathe in a beautiful town in the Turkish area along with the family.
The residents of the region have already thanked the visitor and have expressed hope for the meeting and for the personal community.
The new "Cross" that goes into the post is probably due to the new version of the old song that Jukov now wrote with blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).

Support me with the Hand Up fans, "We don't need a new piece."
Most of them write directly that the originals of their time are more popular.

How the decision of the CB to reduce the key rate affects the economy
We're waiting for Russia's bank to reassess the key.
It was still at 0.25 per cent point, up to 4.25 per cent of the year - a formally limited historical minimum.
The Court of Justice will consider the economic prospects more optimistic than ever before, as well as the seriousness of the CB statements and the updated projections on the Russian economy.
This means that the current cycle of money-credit policy mitigation can be maintained as soon as possible.
"We have continued to mitigate monetary and credit policy, firstly taking into account that the risk of inflation remains low from 4 per cent in 2021," the head of the Russian Bank Elvira Naboulina reported.
They are linked to a significant reduction in economic activity, domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, Naboulin said, would take more than half a year.
She noted, however, that following the removal of restrictions on the pandemic, economic processes were alive: energy consumption, consumer demand and investment have been restored, the construction and release of consumer goods have slowed down the annual pace of reduction of transport, production.
According to the CB's clear forecast, in 2020 the economic downturn was 4.5-5.5 per cent (expected 4-6 per cent) and the economic recovery growth in 2021 was 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, in 2022 - 2.5 to 3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised annual oil prices to $38 and $40 for the Urals barrier in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB had waited 27 and 35 dollars for Barrel.
Finally, the 2020 inflation forecast of the Bank of Russia amounted to 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy becomes more optimistic, which approaches us to the end of the freezing cycle, the Russian economists and the Russians consider Renesans Capitala Sofia Donez and Andrey Melaštenko.
Yes, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of the summer, it has already dropped to 3.5 per cent.
At the last meeting, in June, the CB quickly reduced it to one percentage point due to low inflation due to the demand and the need to stimulate the latent result of the pandemic and its economic constraints.
The opportunities for monetary-credit policy are maintained (at the next meeting, 18 September and before the end of the year), but, far closer, the main analysis of the Rosbank Evgeni Koschelev is agreed.
The aggregate of inflational risks also points to the proximity of breaks in the mitigation of a percentage policy - broken supply chains, the possible increase in costs due to measures to prevent the epidemic and faster (as expected) recovery of demand, he says.
In order to complete the following actions, the Bank of Russia needs more attention to the inflation process during the harvest season, as well as to the external vulnerability that has increased on the basis of geopolitical conflicts, Koselev points out.
In other words, a reduction in the key rate will lead to further reductions in rates for the most reliable lenders, and perhaps, on the assumption, the senior analyst of the opening bank, Maxim Petronević.
The correction of the rate would be less pronounced than the reduction of the rate.
Consumer credit rates can still fall to 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates can end year in the 6,2-7 per cent range, not excluding BCS Prime Minister Anton Pokatovic.
The average contribution rates, he believes, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5 per cent (now just above 4.5 per cent).

The Podmoskoja authorities have discussed the fate of closed talks
In Podmoskok, solid home wastes continue to be closed.
In this year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing river basins are modernized in modern mosero-transoperating complexes.
But this option is not possible for every polygon - many of them have expanded flat roofs.
After the poligon is closed, it is formed into a reculpture, the polignon body is rescinded with grunts, the degasation system and the removal of the infiltration.
This allows the chemical process to cease inside the dust so that it does not melt, it does not grow worse, it does not disintegrate soil and deep water.
And then the exhalation remains to be lifted by a useless dog in the midst of its dwelling structure.
Why don't you do something useful about it?
For example, in Russia, where the cultivation of the "Annino" is literally completed on days, the authorities consider the option to make a doll of a gorno-shell.
This polygon, operating from 1976 to 2016, is expanding beyond the boundaries of the land under it.
Therefore, a neighboring area has to be purchased in reculture, which has already been lost by a musor.
"Sometime he's going to be, he's going to sit down," he's gonna get tired, and we're gonna think we can do what he can to get started.

Two polygons will become areas for renewable energy sources
"Torbeevo" in Luberc and "Timkhova" in the Bohorods District will become the fields of renewable energy sources from greenhouse and biological gas.
At the end of the year, a gas power station will be launched to generate up to 8 million power-hours per year and a range of 0.95 glucals of heat, which will provide their own fuel needs - heating of administrative and manufacturing facilities.
"Temohov" will produce 72.5 million hours of horsepower and will continue to work as a muscle transplanting complex.
A museum may be created on the Balachin Peninsula "Kukino", which was closed after the people's complaints on the Straight Line with the president of the country.

Russia's actor responded to the charges of "LGBT propaganda and feminism"
The actor of the Russian Chiki series, who was accused of “proposal of LGBT and feminism”, responded to a claim to the film.
The authors "considered the seriousness of the subjects raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Steven Thomas Oxner, in the absence of the edition of "Go".
"I think it's a story of power and the general aspects of human life.
It's nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said an actor playing the father of a boy who moved into a woman's dress.
He stressed that he was proud of his work and that he did not consider it a propaganda.
