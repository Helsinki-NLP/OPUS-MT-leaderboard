No novelty for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament has rejected the request to withdraw the paragraphs of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the framework of an appeal, based on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced.
The new arrangements that could have opened the way for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to be released were the members of the Chamber at the second reading of the application for a remedy for the punishment for economic difficulties.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment in October because of the conclusion of a alleged subsequent contract with Russia on the purchase of land gas.
The Court of Justice is not yet legal, and in December the appeal of the judges is to be brought before the Court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as the political framework of the regime, and also in the West, the process has caused the court to be suspicious of the pre-triality.
The application, paragraph 365, on which the Prime Minister was sentenced to withdraw from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 members.
226 votes would have been necessary for his adoption.
Libbyscher Sieg
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or the Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gadafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region is commonly seen in the elections of Islamists, the question is only which - those that are balanced or radical.
The National Transitional Council was known for the customary law of the Scharí, from which you have a certain idea with God now.
Libya would be in the country without crime, because for the fatty lot, you'll cut your hand short.
Women should also forget the idea of emancipation as soon as possible, any religious convictions should be corrected, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be drawn up in the future by the Quran from opposing tribes.
short-term - in Libya, there will be an order which will not be visible to these countries and, above all, will not be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objective view now, but also not the best and the exchange would hardly fit the above-mentioned Liberians.
It is even more encouraging to see that the Muslim fighters have been helped by the faithless dogs.
To their apology, the fact may only serve the fact that NATO’s air strikes were not directed by any general from America, but by God himself, whose power was granted after any successful encounter.
The winner in Libya?
We only took part in a committee exchange, served the interests of Islam and our politicians defeated in the person of the dictator of a political alliance without having had any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw more of a military occupation of Libya.
That is why the Hissai are a worry - that is, the spread of the cruisers.
But do the mining companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
Of course not, and so the West can finally defend itself with the right to self-determination in matters of the protection of human rights.
If this does not cause them to lose their Scharijua.
Start a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of the investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm was needed through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy continued to lie compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
But today, the bond market deserves all records.
The investors not only maintain Greece, but also between Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical authorities of the European Area, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
The GDP in Germany is expected to grow by 0.5%, which in France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected (increased by 0.3% instead of 0.1%), while France increased slightly by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent this year in the third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product increased and according to Tsch. The Statistical Office thus confirmed the trend in growth in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent this year in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, however.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the whole euro area and the EU, the economy increased by 0.2 per cent between July and September, compared to the previous quarter, in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The interest rates from their 10-year state loans decreased by 28.45%.
The rates of the Italian and Spanish state companies rise to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to solve problems...
The rates in the Czech State are below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes are to be taken by the ECB to be a believer of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they win 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football choice has raised the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-founded tower Czech and a wonderful tower by Petr Jiráček they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to protect its luxurious origin from the game and will not be missed again in the European Union.
IHNED.cz followed up the game in a detailed report.
Less alarm in the first half and a rice proportion happiness in the second half.
The Czech election also won thanks to the final weakness of the household, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, exactly 1:0 and thus opened her ticket for the football-em.
In addition, because of the precise defense of the Czech mansion, they were able to put the Montenegriner under more pressure in the second half of the year.
The dog birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucic, who shot two chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech election will be joined by the European masters for the next year, it is also happy that the domestic football has a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, it was played by a straight football.
Both men combined for a long time and were especially played around the medium line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the household remained high, and the broad conclusions before the trial were successfully rejected by the Czech opposition.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core programme.
They were making a living picture.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living painting around here about a core object in Iran.
With these gifts, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the country's country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students of the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a living scene around the core technology centre in Isfahan, in the Uran on Tuesday.
They wanted to make it possible for them to be ready to protect their country's core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently concluded in its report that Iran has not shown any evidence of its efforts for nuclear weapons.
In Israel, too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
The students had prayed before entering the complex on Wednesday and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack carried out in the minds of the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press would also be the nuclear weapons plant in Nathan's attack target.
The food map of a pregnant child: It doesn't breakfast and eats for dinner break Wurst
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9% of all students and 5% of all children.
Show current questions - adipous children are mostly from families with poor lifestyle.
Once again, it shows how important for the healthy development of a person is the millennium in which he grows and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipulative children up to half the time are on the table than in families where normal-born children live.
More than 19 per cent of the overweight children had an accident at the front of the statement under the motto "Adiposas is not an accident" of pommes for the evening break.
In families with Dickerchen, sports is not just about the favorite jobs, but also about the majority of today's students - only 15 percent said that their parents found themselves at least once a week for active movements.
Question of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, where nearly 900 children from primary schools were questioned throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is no accident", supported by the General Hospital and Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the increasing number of children with overweight or even fattyness.
"Only half of the children interviewed, for example, five times a day, in the morning-second morning lunch break - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and breakfast for breakfast
Experts point out that also relatively minorities, such as regular family breakfast, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In Chechnya, however, only 23 percent of the students' families have breakfast.
And, in most families, everyone gets to be alone.
The worst was the determination that will not be cut off in every tenth family.
The breakfast applies to this as the basis for healthy daily food.
The survey included the day when overweight children were consumed much more than unhealthful pommes in families.
And almost everyone - no back on weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 per cent of the children in question are sports, only less than half of their parents do so — only 15 per cent.
Merge your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 young people and 172 girls from 13 schools) to combine their own diet plan from offered options to appetit and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto food is far from the ideal of healthy food.
Among their favorite dishes are many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweet sauces.
"Alarming is particularly the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report highlights this question.
At noon, then the main court, ten-year-olds won almost in front of flights.
The children were almost unable to bear fruit, and also the popularity of fish and vegetables was very small as lunchtime.
Health Care
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are ready to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, a significant breakdown of the preferences to the principles of healthy food was recorded in the results of the project following the conclusion of the Adipositas ruling.
Suddenly this was, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed many other flights or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less beef or sweet food.
Professionals demand - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introduction article on how to learn about stylesists, I had a little mixed up that this was a little too much for the beginning.
I didn't know what else was coming.
Presentations of three professors from the industry, the clothing of problem figures and a seminar on how it runs "on the spot".
It's gonna get worse.
The closer we get to the test, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every day and every Sunday, it is full.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (at the course no single man participates) how to treat a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
And these are still most of us.
The one has a very short neck, the other one is a very young figure without proper curves and others are soft.
It is the case of the stylist, to dig wide holes optically, to extend the neck or to improve the necessary curves.
We also get tips on how to wear a female type like Jennifer Lopez - so with large buses, wide lifts and small tires - beautiful and figure-tone without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between size and height is so large that the rock or the hose does not really fit, at least one piece should be cut to size.
This will certainly not be true, because good seating is easy to pay.
In such a scaled rock, you feel much better than in one of the pillars that always falls up and down in the valley, etc.
Juvenile figures can also be allowed to wear clothing with fall, bausques, applications, stickers or scraping.
With these lots of information and figures, I am glad that I have a whole week's time to let everything go fundamentally through my head.
Nevertheless, I am afraid that in view of the proposed household assignment, it is almost impossible to create.
Each of the trainers was given a promi to consider their appropriate expenses - day clothing and abbreviation.
We should take into account the current appearance, the model style of the respective star and its figure type.
I'm going to "take Miranda," maybe you know from the campaign Victoria's secret.
In the inside I jubilant, because this is much better for me personally than to draw Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably taken hundreds of kilos (well, that's a little overt), or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothing items should be cut off from magazines or searched, printed, and subsequently processed on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our whole personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic page of the styling.
The stylelist refers not only to the models but also to the so-called product page in the journals (by specific standards, for example trend handle bags, coins, etc.).
That's what the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's only Sunday.
That means a guy's got to have a good overall view.
The Saturday proposal, which was filled with information on figures, was accompanied by three visitors from the industry:
by Stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylelist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylelist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in all different ways.
The word Zauber is variable.
So, for example, you can wear a break coat as usual over the Jeans, just like a T-shirt or mantel, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear haircuts and wear it as clothing.
It's enough to raise the brain or the forces and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play the lady," he stressed.
But most of the advice came to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"First you must hurt her," said Jacob.
Finally, I can explain why we need to break all these teachings, what you can combine with, and why even if you often see anything different in modern journals.
Get off fashion shoes.
Thanks to photographer Ben I know now that a stylelist has to prepare a lot more clothing options than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (about ten outfits) to make at least fifty styles.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks quite different than in reality.
So with all that, you have to figure out when you're planning the exit.
The image and style of the success in half the time, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
There's only one time Madonna needs to look at a not just brilliant singer, who made a world star from the image and marketing.
In Chechnya, the services of a stylelist are more reserved.
Also known personalities often hold this for money spent (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is twofold).
And if any one of us is already styled, then we should think that he or she will force us to a completely different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you just need to go on and go on to make sure that the bowl Vardpresse writes that the relevant promi has to be re-examined or removed, etc.
Jan and Mario told us on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist should focus only on the fashion and then "consolidate" the output.
In his work, he has to communicate primarily with the people he controls and must be a serious psychologist.
People appreciate it without offering themselves and their opinions.
"If we are commanded by any manager to look at her skin cancer and find beautiful pieces, then we can't get her out of it and say, "My God, that's terrible."
"I have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend what you can bring," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "platz bag" must contain.
So this is a bag that is attached to the toilet and is attached to all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as shoes, hairdryers or safety needles, they also contain such tools as a nylon faden (to help the stylist in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the outer garment is covered, if it is too large (suckles or other clothing are undercut so that the fabric is not cut) and naturally close.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly cover shoes.
Even when photographing in the theater, where the floor is above, you can damage the shower, wash the outside.
We're dressed and we're dressed...
You can't even touch the shoes, so you can't hurt them.
So you really have to go forward.
Mario welcomed me by praising my "Creation" without restrictions.
That is not just my strength.
All of this was only part of what we had to hear at the second weekend.
One thing has become clear between me - to focus on the style at professional level, is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree drive is completely preventable by a series of diletarian errors on the road to the morning ship.
It has been a long time to meet the ambitions to a large part, but what does it have to do if no one apparently had fun to do a little more.
Just before he came to the Ladentic, the new part developed with the title "The Run" high expectations.
However, he promised that the already-old "need for Speed" series would move a piece again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he did not actually appear to be just one of many action games.
We were also curious how the adjusted passports, in which the main protagonist rises from the car and continues to walk.
But as you're already used to NFS, there's a lot else in the end than you've expected.
Sure - potentially there are right-hand arcade races, but the game of some overflowing errors, which have been present in this series for a few years or less.
So there are actually no errors anymore, but rather signaling an inconsistencies in the principle of the player.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time in history, its main figure, Jack, has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal competition between America and America.
In San Francisco, then in the West Coast, you are on the Leckroad - with the task of being first in New York.
The background contains a series of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided into ten stages and into more than five individual rows.
This means that each race will be extended to other stages and that the individual stages will be located in different, sufficiently different and interesting miles.
You don't have a moment to think that game would always offer the same thing again.
Some of the environments are still quite interesting to see, although the technical level of the graph does not differ from that of the earlier parts of the series.
So there's nothing going on in the world.
But the road through the desert, through the remnantland or high up through deep-shadow landscape is very pleasant in sight.
Here and again, typical elements bring a little different into the individual rows.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains again, you have to make sure you don't get hurt by a lion.
In addition, the individual rows are properly built around each other.
Just a few, but they're enough.
For a long time, you try to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to take time (classic race against the stoppage), then expect another personal double with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are doing. They want to change the whole thing.
A novelty is passengers in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack flies before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less of such passports in the game than you would expect (mostly only three).
Finally, this is more beneficial, because at least this element has no chance to be long-term - it is part of the context of the above-mentioned elements that make the game more flexible.
The model of driving is shown in the headings of the preceding parts.
This means, from today's point of view, it does not reach out to any trees, otherwise it could not be claimed it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations must look different.
But an action-charged racer will continue to be well justified despite the fact that it could be found better in competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems occur only after some time.
Unlike the vehicle model, the collition model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that complicated deformations and collisions are calculated, but if you actually don't have a look at any object before, how the car behaves, it's obviously not all right.
Typical example: When a car is overloaded or overloaded, you “strike” the other cars in some places only easily, in others, almost identical situations, you come into the stairs and turn wild pirates.
Or the career goes down to the same length.
Thanks to the restart system, however, it doesn't go on anymore, it's all embarrassing.
The restarts are solved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then a game will return to the last stop point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five reboots.
If you've made it out, everything's going to be out of front.
So the remnants are more like a means of helping, for the fact that something doesn't work out, but you shouldn't be left there.
Sometimes, however, it doesn't help the restart, because nothing helps to learn anything else than the critical section from the head.
Speaking out is uncomfortable that the same things often happen at the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be carried out in a very specific way, or simply do not pass through.
On the other hand, you always meet at the appropriate location "civil" cars in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly alarming in situations where you see that the opponent is in front of a two-off car, but until you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to turn them around or brake them.
And it's okay when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes close to this situation before your nose.
The competitors have further advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you will always be overcome by the same opponent and even here again without turning back at the moment.
The crazyest is to finish the game on the long bridge that is being dealt with.
The opponent has to get out of here, obviously, on the devil.
And if he's already in front of one, then he's taking a look of course, so you start driving your own car a few times in Klump.
Of course - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this idea is so clear that it will soon lose the joy of the game.
And that's bad, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is completely sustainable and is also being carried out so that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, what's "debt" on it - the concept with five unique routes, the ordering of the race in a way that no long paths can come up, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the change in driving during the race.
You can't look at the tanks on the street, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is enough that you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are suitable for the urban areas, which are strong American limos for the actual cars and exotic super sports cars for the technical vehicles, such as the serpentins in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode goes also the task mode (history challenges) - so the race in the different locations that you know from history.
Here there are not only media, but also learning points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (history) and history.
To achieve the higher driving level, different items must be closed: start from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also connected to the online function Autolog, which is similar to the results obtained by the other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible cuts is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come with the car in an u-road tunnel (i.e. in the middle), where you climb in the dark on the skis (i.e. in the middle).
At the tacho, the figures look between 150 and 200 km/h (the road), but there comes a U-road at once from the back and leads to an uncompromising break.
In our edition, we may still be struggling with whether it was a blackout of the player or whether the authors held us for such a blood.
The technical page is not overwhelming, but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is even more alarming that at some exciting moments, image heights will slow down and this will be somewhat dramatic.
However, this is the case with a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is not useful either.
The soundtrack is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is a taste case.
In an effort to reach as wide as possible a scale as possible more young audiences, a soundtrack a la "of every thing" arose - but who buys such a game because of music already?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game wasn't matched by the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have claimed with the Brustton of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last few years.
But that's how the game works somehow.
Enjoy a class, but you should be prepared to make this mistake with the power of air traffic controllers.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought equal weight to the individual institutions from the lot."
I didn't expect such a hard war to come out."
"It will last five or six years until the eggs are hatched and everyone has become accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began with her speech at the legal college.
As she takes seriously the motto "Suppliedly and openly about Europe", she has already shown in the first part of her speech, in which she was able to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she would have been able to subscribe to such a number of lecturer at the University of Karls.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new Permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning it was critical that he was too innocent - a grave officer who had not been raised in such a role, but I must say that it has caused everyone to lose the spirit as well as he has accepted the matter.
"It is a person who brings it to an end to patiently listening to seven-hundred Member States to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas on how it should go with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: Who really is the European Union? What number am I to call?", so as an important step to agree and improve the flexibility of EU policies towards countries, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil hunter Quargel.
Ms Vicenová also focused on the agenda, which the European Union lived, lived and thought about in the near future.
Two years ago, the Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs had celebrated the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the Government during the Presidency was described as a major negative one that seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU now has to do everything in its power.
With the words of the messenger, it went not only to the president, but also to the coming crisis that has not been overemphasized so far.
The EU's seven-year budget must yet be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it is a slender and fragmented budget, which is given economic priority, which countries are more and less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The messenger also remembers her own slogans, which she came to Brussels: "Responsively about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there's terrible throats, foreign words, and a professional dog who doesn't understand.
How do I really know if you think of yourself as a citizen in Brussels really cruel or around churches and different large bananas or if you really want to ban the quargel?
It would also like to use the EU's soil to obtain more checks in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are calling for Eurosceptics to be more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is therefore more difficult.
There are many factors that are responsible, including the retention of our candidates whose inability to write motivation letters and not only the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also took the power and cooperation of the Visagrad Group, which was also the case with V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the French says to me, "He, what are your heads together - that's your V4?" and it makes a pretty pure mining.
Mrs Vicenové, the EU is looking forward, above all, to strict rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
As much more realistic, as a "European federation" it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthening Cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only countries should cooperate, who want it and those who don't want it, should be left alone."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately pass on a strong "Europe of the Various Speeds", expects Mrs. Vicenová.
In this regard, she also respected the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, namely, that all issues affecting the whole EU by all Member States should be discussed, not just by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to find a suitable word that the strategy of IBM was the most accurate, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the broad public IBM is the Synonym for technological revolution, known as modern companies, although it has been a century since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity had already been laid by her first head - the visionist Thomas J. Watson.
Once he's left the slogan, unsatisfied world problems can easily be solved if people are ready to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became so marked that it should play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the internal magazine that was released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture originally prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM therefore survived and has been successful for a whole century because it has remained firm in its principles and did not hesitate to change all other ring sum.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmsano, today's director of the company from the start of the anniversary.
Trusted system
Whatson had already worked in the thirty-year social affairs of his employees - similar to the Băa entrepreneur in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees, insurance by entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as working clothes and a well-planned pay system for the best newers and dealers.
The long-term relations of IBM with their customers are also well explained.
The company was, at the beginning, a great deal of talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world, the IBM took on any discrimination - and was able to examine itself accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, which is to be replaced by a woman, will be replaced by Virginia Rometty's wife in the next year.
It has been in IBM for thirty years until it has taken the position of the vetriebs, marketing and strategic capital.
IBM is making so-called online business distortions in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations have grown.
No wonder - there are enough ideas in the company, almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Your unsustainable position in the business ensures a strong image and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution as a mere technology company," said economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony of the Consulting Company Forrester Research.
As the company stresses itself, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logos for family "Big Blue", has grown to be one of the world's largest companies in one century.
It is one of the largest technology companies in the world - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its most known findings include banknotes, credit cards, financial swaps, strip code or the discs.
With approximately 220 billion dollars of Börsenvalt (market capitalisation) this year IBM was the second largest technology company (as well as Apple), where it was first over Microsoft since 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations were the taste of customers today - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or even the IBM PC computer jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't relate emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmsano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if it does not work, it will also leave them.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who is in principle with his Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
To the maximum extent IBM is involved in services, software and hardware, to the highest extent one fifth is involved.
It was still in 1990 hardware with a maximum of more than 50 percent.
Since 2000, IBM has invested little profit in the value of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested 58 billion in the purchase of future-powered technologies.
In these investments IBM also continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis first hit the world as a storm.
Here IBM also believed in the power of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the middle of the Great World Economy crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is experiencing the present crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased dramatically by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company’s net profit continues to grow.
The business log of IBM: everything can change - not just the values.
That is why it can also be expected that this flexible giant will also raise the next crisis.
IBM history: from cash-flower to world flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York 100 years ago had a fairly complex name - Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted only in 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a download in Canada and South America.
The basis for later company IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They have technologies such as the famous charts to register the beginning and end of work.
To the architects of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who had also been in the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed Thomas J. Watson's head of the competition company to help him lead the company.
This leader then even put the basis of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas today on the company's inexhaustible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, start as the name already exists, with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from Wurst-and-Kassessettes, to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded to and on all continents.
Watson was so irresponsible for the company that he spent 40 years in the capital, first he was fired by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under this direction IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, engineers and computers of IBM of NASA fly to All - to Mercur and Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard at that time came under the name IBM 5150 on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand it purchased the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus increased fully and fully in the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that is paid by IBM in the last three years is the concept "Smart Planet".
It undermines the intention to use technologies in a slow way in unplanned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector IBM recently introduced the "Smart Trade" platform to help dealers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Chechnya.
In 1932 IBM established a download in the then Czech Republic - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brönn.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and here is also a world-wide superseded team that includes voice recognition technology.
Darina rychtárová over her entire streets:
Iveta - this eagle can keep you, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtárová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband, Josef Rychtář (53) became the protector of Iveta Bartosšová (45) to his lover, Darina still had the hope that Joseph would wake up and come home from his rosary dream.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life she has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtárová.
If Darina rychtárová had invited the singer I. Bartosšová to visit her own house, she would probably not have fallen into the dream as it did with her husband.
When Iveta returned to Ríčany after 30 days on her knees, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved her.
In time, Darina redesigned, and it seemed as if she wanted to marry her trusted husband again - but now she finally gave him the walkway.
Rychytár is equal to who his wife sleeps with
If Dr. Iveta Bartoshová should be left in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms.
"He's the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I won't let him go."
"But not as beloved, dearer old esal, but as a man with whom I still have certain connections," said Mrs. Rychtárová; but she also said that she had been emotionally separated from him and existed only on mutual jurisdiction.
The condition that Darina has hit him in the back is that Joseph is still with him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper wedding and I want to respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I buy."
"With Darina, I kept myself quite normal, only the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtár (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop her from it.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm clear that it's my fault that I loved me in Iveta and that's why I take every responsibility.
The worst female offenders: How's it going with you?
If you invite men to call some typical female unaccompanieds, then they will immediately shoot some prompts out of the brain.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let some unsitting Revue pass again, which allows men to shed blood in the adrenals?
Procurement
Do they expect their boyfriend to be shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hat every week?
Would you like to go shopping and can it be a little more?
Then it's really going to be a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their shopping deadline under control.
But what woman's hand on the heart, which she already seems to be looking for a good surface clothing just to burn through a clothing business and not even try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if the purchase for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
But let them tell you how many times they've told their husband - you've ever been out...
Standing Disappointment
"Am I not too thick?"
"I had to give up at least five kilos - should I start playing, jogging, or making Gymnatics?"
"May I ever fall for you?"
Do they know anything about it?
Yeah?
Then you may also belong to the women who have the right to know how they look.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex is few - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are always inseparable.
Order and safety at first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Punching windows, floating windows and stubs, at least twice a week, when they jump - and this is at least twice a week.
Swim with her partner, because once again he passes with dirty shoes on the clean rivers, you beat the children because the newly cut wash basin is already drunk and because the glass in the living room has already printed the fingernails, but where does the cop make it so much?
If you suffer under this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you can't exceed anything and that the order and purity in family life are not at first.
In the end, this unsanitary cleaning plant can also damage the mutual relations and especially the peace of the family.
Styles
"Smuggling Turnhosen comes into the pool."
"Do you really want to take the old shoes again tomorrow?"
"A nassa hat is not just on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyrant, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, that doesn't mean bad, but they just want everything that's in order.
If the men knew that, the women might not have to mix so much.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women would like to cry and shout, because behind the back, they will be moved or even hurt or hurt ties.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they want to discuss such topics, such as who, where, how, and why, for example.
Well, each of us women has a little unharmed klatsch and tratsch on the store.
Hands on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with the most terrible calibers, which is nothing and no one is holy, who would rather consider everyone in their environment and pose a serious threat especially to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček joined Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockeysturmer Jaromír Jágr had two assistants large part at the NHL at 5:3-Siege of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is therefore the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who was also an assistant and became the best player of the match, took advantage of the insight of the nine-year-old Eishockeystar.
Two assistants in the same game also named Jágr's player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game journalists against Giroux had a great prophecy night.
"Before the game, I'm telling him that he's got a hittrick today."
I felt it somewhere."
"He and again experience such a feeling," explained Jágr, after his action Giroux had already obtained a door on the first board of the Flyers.
A little later, the second encounter also had "a Czech trail".
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and put it between the circles of the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the third round, the home player Patrick Dwyer obtained a short hand, but then the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Special Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he reached his third hit, then Wayne Simmonds linked his shot to the fourth door.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the League, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said his center.
"I wouldn't be able to play with such an eishockey player at the end of my career like him."
"That makes me rich."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my players put their game on me and now turn around the mirror," said Jágr.
Carolina was still playing the drama - through the encounter with Tuoma Rutua and once again twice, who was transferred from a criminal committee, it came to a door.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was successful in number two against one.
"Adequately, pronger was still active in our area."
"He raised the puck, I took a ride and (read) went to get away from the poodles."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad he's touched," Voráček described the last encounter of the party from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and shot in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candians, along with their experienced beck, also had their leadership an unprecedented in Penalty Shoes 2:3.
One of the criminal committees was unable to change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the trainer of the home society, although the high-skilled accident in the defense - the game only played with five players at the end.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we only played with one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do to make it done," said Jacques Martin.
"With each exchange, an attack wave after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We would have made the game easier and have to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reservations here," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czech Torréj Pavelec left thirty pieces of Tampa Bay and thus contributed to 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which thus ended a series of five lowlands, there were five different protected parts.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five approved state travel offices in the then ČSSR: Čedok, sports tourism, CKM, Recrea and Auto tourism.
The travel offices were then sold mainly for travel in the socialist Eastern bloc countries, and in the West they were only allowed to choose.
And so Czech tourists travel to the Baltic (in the German Democratic Republic – the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Black Sea Peninsula), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when travel to Yugoslavia was allowed, then Yugoslavia entered a trial course and therefore the travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries of the East block (also the Czechs).
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise it was not possible for individual travel.
In the past, the travel offices also made trips to the west, but they had to buy huge shouts or even spend the night in front of the travel office, or at least "good-known" in the travel office.
It wasn't the same for a long time.
The so-called dividends - the condition of a trip in the West - were only "politically reliable" people - the others could not even travel.
The Czech Slovak currency was therefore not a free exchange currency, without divisibility, so it would have been impossible to extend the necessary financial resources (west currency) for a trip to the west.
Therefore, most of the other Czechs bought their holiday in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and such ones - a habit that continues to this day.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a revolution of the Czechs on foot.
By 1989, while a holiday in DDR or Bulgaria had been the measure of everything, the Czechs had spent 4.5 million of their foreign shares in countries around the world.
A powerful paradox, which is no longer recognized today, is the fact that in the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, it was not possible to travel until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Similarly, since the beginning of the 1990s in the past century, the obligation to provide services has been raised in the neighbouring Western European countries, leading to a violent wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechs could not get enough time from their journeys to the west, each wanted to be there for at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech holiday breakers travel to Paris on the ground floor in the park, for who had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature in the travel of Chechen was a pre-conservations, beer and long-lasting, etc. full-packed coffee room.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists could finally buy the western currency.
Our standard of living, as well as this, also increases the average levels, which in 1997 emerged in another important moment.
Due to the increased demand for travel, the travel offices began to prepare regular trips by charter flights after 1997, which made it impossible for the airlines to negotiate multiple discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had a separate payout with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
For another interesting moment in the history of the "post-all" travel, it came in 2000, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to distant sunny countries each year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are directly from Chechnya.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually in exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the era, which marked our post-survivor development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States assumed the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitely took place among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs sold more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, and gave up more than 15 CZK per head for a single holiday period, including the costs of the holiday resort.
The main meeting is to find a new president - again a pact.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no president, and it seems that the successor of Ivan Hashek will not be known at the top of the Czech football league (FAČR) even after the extraordinary main assembly on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is still no agreement on which assessment is to be chosen.
And without this, there is no vote on the three potential followers.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hashek returned from his function, where he had urged his colleagues to find themselves too few and a strong personality that could lead to football in the future.
Only - in the era to Hashek, the old roots between the two interconnected rooms are re-examined, which cannot be attributed to a joint candidate.
This proved to be a stone and clear on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the main assembly were quite different from the people's house in Prague, where the negotiations did not lead to results, and this was not just about the choice itself.
It was not even possible for some who were actually voting in the plenary - only the legislative representatives or the officials who were fully equipped with the power.
In this single point, it was at least partially agreed that the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law should not be taken into account on the basis of a representation based on full power.
However, the disputes about valuation continue to arise.
Nor did the Executive Committee make any further clarification of the matter at its meetings - whether it is orderly or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views regarding the choice have changed a few times - the neural point remains the same.
The question arises: how should you proceed in round 3 to avoid a patent situation?
"The focus is on whether to proceed in accordance with the set, or whether a completely different model is to be found," Dušan Svoboda, one of the three chairpersons of the FAČR, pointed out in the management of the professional football.
According to the legal model, in the third round of the candidate, who receives the largest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is applying.
Seas are apparently ready to enter into the compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes in both rooms.
The Czech side is again on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority at this percentage of votes.
"Then the two rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-room concept," Svoboda understands the impressions of the Maori side that it was best not to add the rating, but rather to choose a valid set.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this too, even though it is stated that the legitimate evaluation of all candidates is likely to be opposed to Pelta at first.
"My wish is to be chosen as much as possible after the sentence."
"In order not to be overlooked, as in the last main assembly," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time has been candidate and was particularly limited in his opinion against Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburg and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the National Mission for Football-Em today would certainly contribute to the reconciliation of farmers."
"If the football is only on the euphoric well, then there is also a greater willingness to cooperate," says the staff member of Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three approaches and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope to agree, but the situation is sad."
"This is not a matter between the people of the mountains and the seas, but there are certain efforts to "delegate the rules for their own purposes."
"This is why a new blockage in the main assembly is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind will finally see," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to take all sides no longer.
Some negotiations should probably be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football will be complete until the qualification game is complete.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague the morning because of a technical disturbance, and thus a fireman was looking for a replacement, such as to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the east of the Barrage game.
Finally, however, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial to arrive on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Education, Youth and Body Training, would like to move the split parties within the country's largest sports link.
It is very much at stake: state applications, the reliability of the Czech football and also the upcoming main assembly of the ČSTV, which will show the Czech sport in the wake of Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik goes into the struggle for the position of the president, because he does not see suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, head of the Pilsner football club prior to the extraordinary main assembly, could have made a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his suggestions on the new president of the football league in the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have been involved in the struggle for this excellence.
"If there were any good enemies, I would fight for him and abandon the choice."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adoption," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favor of the choice, Pelta, to the tip of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he will only consider exercising the role of the President for only one year, until 2013, until the end of the general meeting.
In the position of the president, he would like to see an experienced top manager who has not been very involved in the football game.
"With some people asking questions, I have spoken personally."
"I can't believe some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"I'd like to change such views," he said.
In most cases, Paclík is alleged to interfere with Pelta's connection with the president of the Pilsner district football league, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation that is considered to be a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegation approvals at major assemblies.
For Paclik, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta had the position of the president.
"By his victory, the present state would be preserved and in the Czech football field it was not going forward at all."
"The support by Berbr, a smart business man, doubles the football," Paclik stressed.
In this way he also points out that Pelta's name fell in connection with telephone calls for detection in a corruption case, but the Pelta made criminal charges.
"I don't know what reward a victory of Pelta should bring to the (e.g.) football."
"And how we would fall into the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who said earlier, "will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta presidents are going to be", but he has already seen something lower.
If Paclík is to be seen in the Donnerstaval, however, he can imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
A further candidate - Rajchl, who had supported the Paclik prior to the major assembly in October, was also thinking of a further candidate.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could give him a good example as head of the National Mission."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the connection as a manager."
"I don't get my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had taken care of seeing that in September, he was on the spot with Luděk Macella, who replaced Dagmar Damková after the trial of the Court of Justice.
Paclík himself claimed that he felt the role of the co-chairperson.
And this calls on his ability to lead private companies, since last summer he is also chief of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the League with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence discipline and vocational commissions, which has resulted in adverse situations," Paclik pointed out, who did not make a hero out of his antipathy, for example, against the Sparta Chief Daniel Krétínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help him to lobby for more money from the lottery.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new president should focus on."
"If it comes to the control of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say briefly and clearly where the money goes," he said.
Its connection to the Pilsner Club also does not seem to Paclík as a handy, although he himself stresses that the president of the FAČR must be "participative".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not just ideal."
"But it does not make much sense to transfer my shares to the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after half a century," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new set-ups of the FAČR, which will end a patent situation in the future.
Two days before the Main Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, will make it strong in the event of his election that the FAČR will come to new status, which will end in future disputes over the assessment of priorities.
The Jablonec staff is confident that the elections will be held in Nymburk prior to the Donnerday negotiations, and believes that the election will be successful if the Czech election is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September, he wanted to focus on the national parliament and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election prior to the last major assembly and thus had the opportunity to help him to defend his ideas on the leadership of the football team and in a broader context.
"People at all levels turn to football, they are impatient and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the relationship will be directed by someone, he thinks that the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonezer Club, who has also been active for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
That is why he also believes that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that prevailed in times of Ivan Hashek.
"The leaders were admitted to the main assembly in June, which were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different explanations, we had already had a president since September," Pelta said.
After reviewing the most important document of the Civil Society, he used it as a lockboard for the delegates.
"If I become president, then I take it personally and I am ready to take responsibility personally if it does not fall."
"That's a basic thing, without which he can't be," claims Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his opponents.
He had already announced that he could offer a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education and he knew very well that his opponent would be his first representative.
Even Tomáš Paclik hasn't touched him for a long time, which is why he didn't let any dry feet on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to some success."
"But his attacks were devastating, and many people were shocked by his campaign of election."
"And that is why many now doubt his true character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his announcements, which he had already published in September.
According to his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes to the National Mission.
And this is supposed to be a Czech football match.
"I would also try to end all disputes - from the cause of Bohemians, to the consequences of the corruption scandal of the past year."
"I would also be involved in negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure adequate financial resources for the entire football game," said the six-year-old ČTK candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football club would not mean any personal dives.
"I first had to trust the contents of all the employees," he said, pointing to Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, it is reasonable to rule out nervousness.
Despite the recent catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the current major assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday do not go to Nymburk.
"If we really should be the only strict point, as you choose in the third round, then we'll go."
"The football needs credibility and only wins it back if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possible decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard with him
If the President-in-Office of the Czech Republic, Mr Rajchl, were to be elected on Thursday at the main meeting to be the new president of the football league in the Czech Republic, this would obviously be the case for many people in the relationship.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce changes to the system and to take responsibility for the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields.
In addition, he promised to resolve the Bohemian case to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to spend more money on football and to continue the work that the former president Ivan Hashek began.
"As president, I want to take the football as a whole."
Get from the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, through the national election, the professional football, to the youth football.
"That's why I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the ČTK talk.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to share the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member is assigned a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that the football will come in every segment with mileage."
Many would not just be surprised because they had to start working hard now instead of criticising others' work," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, no further candidates have been considered.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't hesitate to strike a link between my legs and every step I make to question," he said as a statement why he delayed.
"Many people told me that I shouldn't give up because there would be others to do."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
He is also likely to be motivated to continue the work that he began under Hashek.
"In two years we've handled a lot of work, and I don't want to just get rid of it."
"It was initiated processes, which probably only came to power in a few years and I would only see young people stop," he thought and expressed his thoughts that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose to return the situation in the times ahead of Hashek.
"I believe in systematic events and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"The people behind him, above all, who would make the football so that he would only be chosen for those who have been chosen."
I can't say anything, but I'm not going to be a part of it."
"I strive to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's all going well and not just the chosen ones," noted Rajchl.
He also rejects the claim that he is only a president of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claimed the opposite, I really have the best option for fish."
"For example, it is time to pass whether you should not share the League in a Czech and a Hungarian part whose winners then rise to the first League."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three marble clubs are playing in the league, which is especially a problem for young players in the Moon," Rajchl says.
Since the chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclik has now joined the struggle for the role of the president, Rajchl is not unable to assess his chances of being elected.
"I look forward to a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to represent its vice presidents and now recognizes that clear success lies behind me," Rajchl, who also pointed out the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unsustainable contracts, the agreement on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly responsible for the fact that the connection does not belong to a single strangler.
While he says from Pelta, "who is primarily disqualified to help the Czech football new confidence," he holds the second Rivalen - Paclik for a strong candidate who has really offered the football something.
"No one can question that he has worked in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were chosen, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hashek has introduced, and he would obviously not change his personal opinion in the Commission."
He would certainly not want to give the things to his own good," Rajchl explains about his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Spring in Blue
From Julia Stanek
Plankbekbeken in Ufo-Optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonders - and after a city tour or a journey, they can blow their feet out of mud.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip in the last half years, one in her bag was not missing: her bath access.
Backing on the water, she looked high in artificially designed dolls, they turned against soft marble doors waiting on her backside, and stood about acrylicly restored youth-style baths.
She picked up a bath, took it quickly in her notebook - as well as valuable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 Swimmbangeder learned the architecture history of Meder in this way - and now presents it in its very distinguished book "Badefrezen": Volkswimmehlen in Munich, historical bathroom in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete" in Taunus.
From 13 countries, she took her "travel to the most common baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sports they don't have much on the hat, says Meder - only in the water is the other one.
It's only interesting that we have to find swimming fans with blue keels and chloragesstank, while Jogger is able to unload the damaged dust of fictitious forests or fresh bird nests in the park.
"I have asked myself one day why Swimmbangers really must always be so hot," says the Mede living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface duplicated architecture
The wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are served as honey.
And if the builders have given themselves a taste, swimming can be a real sight: "The state of a foot-and-mouthed ground has a surface of water in the baths."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high oil, hot kechels, spray brakes.
The small-information image band "Badefrieden" delivers at 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness - but above all, makes fun of a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in their search in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent health baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrosated water in an uur karsthöle (Höhllenbad in Miscolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle - shaped building (Várasio Termáfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views nevertheless offer many popular holiday destinations in Switzerland and Austria: While from Züricher Dachbad you have the whole city in your eye, you can look at the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the ride on the ski pista.
The most unusual pool design may be expected by the bathroom guests in the long range: The Aquadome Ötztal looks just like an ufo in the Alps.
From three to three open stairs, it falls in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the east fall into the sky.
Alhambra in Blackzwald
Not in every swimming pool, the pool-sampler of the throat of Chlor rose to the nose.
Many thermal baths flow to Switzerland, in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Bequescsaba, it is so strong that it is not believed to be in a health bath.
The smell comes from alkaline-hydrogen carbonate-containing water, which is almost black and its effect on the skin, as soon as you are allowed to join the beaks - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, Iris Meder was also surprised to find a nice bathroom for her: To visit the free and sunny bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found an abandoned terrace.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed between.
As the Meder looked through the frozen window of the red-white- yellow youth-style building, she saw how unkraut rose between the rivers.
The event was rejected in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three stages of construction have already been behind this bath; not only can you discover the neuromanic elements that came from its construction in 1844, but also a marine hall in Alhambra style, which was added about 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the pool-kenner Iris Meder - and this is not just because it originally comes from the black wall.
"It's already a performance, so different construction styles to melt into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the decline in the thermal pool is only obvious.
Agra-Speculation
Deutsche Bank leaves raw material business to be clarified
Van Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the impact of speculation on the poor of the world.
In January the head of the company wanted to see the consequences.
Hamburg-
For the German citizens, it is clear that 84 percent of the Germans find it unacceptable that banks with agricultural raw materials such as white or mais are speculating.
Two thirds of the respondents also claim that the German Bank and other credit institutions are growing out of this business because it raises the problems of the world's leaders.
This is the result of a Forsa inquiry in the order of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by the footwatch in mid-October.
In this regard, author Harald Schumann shows that the weather on global raw materials drives prices high - and therefore banks are guilty of global hunger problems.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against the German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
In the past, raw materials laws were intended to ensure dealers against price changes.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that the sugars have been linked to supply and demand - and at the cost of the most expensive.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the claims and said that no business would be "valued to put the good reputation of the German bank on the game".
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the requirements of the feedwatch report.
By the end of the year the test should be completed, then the results will be presented to the German Bank Board - and a recommendation on how to proceed.
At the end of January, the bank wants to inform the bank of its consequences.
Finally, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even complete withdrawal.
Ackermann restored his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The rising prices of food are particularly tragic, as banks today have no regard for the general welfare."
Ackermann is now the chief bankenlobyist especially in the obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must extract all the facilities from its portfolio, where money for weather is used at food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or about the reputation of the German bank."
The look of Ackermann comes at the first glance, but it is clear that the company manager wanted to give a perfect picture a few months before he left the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the Board would not be transferred to the Board of Supervisors other than planned.
With a withdrawal from the disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible introductions, he would hardly need to worry – so he would finally have to do his followers.
Each second would cancel raw materials
Footwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
Already more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute of Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
The German Bank therefore maintains that it is legitimate to offer facilities at prices for food.
Many banknotes would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such business: each second the survey would have announced all the facilities where money flowed into the raw material speculation.
43% would open up from such a bank, 49% would allow them to think about publishing their accounts and moving to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The surrounding Pavilion
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depth and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 was awarded prices, became a museum in Vienna, and became empty and exhausted.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern postwar architecture is heated by clear forms, glazed halls, courageous shelves and new materials that are typical for the technical progress of faith, then the Austrian Pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a striking and famous example.
Swanzers Pavilon was then able to obtain the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and moving active steel glass construction.
The building is still considered to be the stone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built Austria’s Pavilon at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhouse plus a magnificent nearby in Munich, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
After the world exhibition in the Swiss garden, Pavilon, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was built in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" was called.
However, the building was neither spacious nor technically as a museum - no walls to hold the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna came to a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come more and more down.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has built the Pavilon, now called the "21st house" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
The museum of Belvedere, which is part of the house, opens the first exhibition – a happy event in every respect.
Through this, Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted artistic history with great careers, etc. in the youth as an artist, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Moderne Salzburg, laid the foundation for politicians and memory defenders, created public funds and private sponsors, and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the painting house were to be performed by the same-named Foundation, a coffee and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built to do so.
Streets And Alleys
Then Krischanitz was the ideal setting for the implementation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna had developed and expanded significantly and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilon was a "very important place" for him, where he had "closed every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur project, and he knew the problems of the building that had already been lost when he moved to Vienna and his use of greatness and ease.
In today's construction, there were far greater problems: the building was "a energy elevator", says Krischanitz.
The glassfassade window profiles were replaced with a glass glass-enforced glass and replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold brake stoppers have been strengthened or replaced, and asbesty-filled tyres have been cured.
Two subspecies brought space for the new use, a cut-off lamp between the house and the street provides for lighting, a bridge leads to entrance - almost a nubula, but still the light switch-Pavilon.
The original exteriors are left, the house is lined up in the old red-brown rose protection colourton.
And the kinosaal is even as exactly as it used to be.
And that's all under the strict supervision of the memory authority and with a small Etate.
"If a material had to be found, it was good and cheap and also appreciated the memory protection," Krischanitz says, pointing to a fallen ground in the basement.
Despite all the obstacles, problems and obstacles, the building is flexible and easy to stay.
It's hard to have been with the Pavilon, "who came from Brussels," has recently said Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City story".
Such a architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants "to develop a proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building accident: To create the Swiss garden here, the fully-planned " main train station" with office and housing.
And another accident may still occur: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you hear it, she already negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Swiss garden.
Bahn plant winter crisis package in million heights
The train has set up a crisis plan to prevent flooding in the winter.
The number of employees to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-conditioned accidents and delays, the German Railway has reported an additional EUR 70 million this year.
The "Image" Zeitung reported earlier on an internal crisis plan, with investments totalling around 300 million euros by 2015.
This will also improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for the cutting edge on railway and road roads to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free railways up to the start of operation and 90 per cent of the working water for use within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube had also warned of an emergency meeting with the government and industry prior to arrivals and delays in this winter.
In the past winter, the train in passenger transport had serious problems, as it lacked reservations, inter alia, under difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorisation from the Railway Agency for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been making it possible for years to make it more often to check the axles of ICE trains in the workshop after an ICE in the Kolner main train station has had an axle brake.
German Bank pays millions of fines in the United States
After the tumult of Chief Josef Ackermann comes from the United States: The Deutsche Bank has to pay a million boutiques there.
If the problems were not enough for the German Bank, the industry still holds its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in a comparison to contribute to conflicts due to the plague of five major economic banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The Financial Market Regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks to have led the economic banks with false contracts for the purchase of financial products; they would have taken the risks down.
Such paper was lost during the financial crisis at great value and the banks grew in depth.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without having to bring the parties to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not make a mistake with the comparison.
This is also true of the Citi group that committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA president, Debbie Mattz, welcomed the arrival of the two households.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Beneficiary Banks and is involved in stakeholders to protect the customer's facilities.
The NCUA seeks to replace the resulting billions of serious damages.
Now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also set up other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
It's about so-called Mortgage-backed Security.
These are home credit bases.
When the 2007 US real estate blouse took place, this became a set of financial firms to be linked.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers turned.
Even if the events have been back a few years, the banks are now in the United States with a heavy wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous complaints to receive recovery or to refuse orders.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has solved the largest clause.
It proposes 18 international banks to have overspended the two state-owned US real estate funders Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgages in the volume of about 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank also has to submit a complaint from the FHFA, which includes several businesses in the value of 14.2 billion dollars in total from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurter to be just present for "substantial losses" without, however, calling a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had shown the demands as permanent and explained that they wanted to stay.
Warren Buffett is rising with 10 billion at IBM
Finance Buffett invests heavily in IT companies IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares in the value of more than ten billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of companies was only bad forecasting.
However, he has now read the business report from IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM provided services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a resort in the financial sector.
As a result, the IT image of IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now realized in the US economy CNBC that he has bought IBM shares in the value of $10.7 billion since March.
Its investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway is thus one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said he didn't even know anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, which had been provided even in the economic crisis for good gain.
"They've done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been spending more time on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of computer centres.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice to both powerful business computers.
Buffett had been able to collect technology companies until the date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffet is about to be taken by a freight train, by a lubricant manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries also parts of a whole range of large companies such as the Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it with sound investments into one of the world's most valuable companies.
However, his life-style has been reported.
That is why he is a cultural figure for countless people around the world.
His almost unambiguous sense of financial value brought him the name "Omaha's Orakel".
According to the Buffet Investments, IBM's share increased by a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars at the pool and thus is counted together with Apple and Microsoft to the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to interfere.
Founder Bill Gates is a friend.
The threat is fatal
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cells" the Turkish media doubled in the German state of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that now survives again.
The deaths of eight Turkish immigrants and a Greek retailer in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-hand extremism background.
This message is answered in Turkey and within the German population in Germany with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German Turks, a long-term resuscitated effort is needed: since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is a danger in Germany, however, was not in question.
However, the right-extremist network, which has been discovered, reveals the size of which is still unseen.
"Does the blue ideology go on again?" the Internet release of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
In addition, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators should be a V-man of the Constitution, and shows concern that German authorities could also be developed in the legal summit.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted to the attack on the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a month's wake in front of the Brandenburg Tower.
Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish Community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turkey Agreement.
In joyful colors, the fellowship was focused - as a story of success.
As an ohrfeige works as the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fifth" renders an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backdrops of the series of murders.
Nor can the German edition of the "Hürriyet" be taken to draw this positive link.
"It's starting to shrink," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people were killed, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to rebuilding Germany with their work.
Most critically, the conduct of the police and their subsequent arrests are discussed in German Internet forums.
Why the German authorities have not done much more to search for suspects in the right-extreme circles.
At least one has shown itself rationally to be prepared for drastic measures: "If we continue to fall here, the migrants remain nothing but self-defence and defence."
"It's probably the best self-defense."
"From the goodness of the disclosure and appropriateness of the persecution of the whole network, the internal peace in Germany depends very strongly on it," says "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger is explained by the accession of Möllen and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of Solingen's fireplace is deeply enchanted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tremendous threat, and to the Germans that mystery and distance can be heard in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks destroyed the feelings of We-We on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the error of the past
In the Turkish press, in particular, the failure of German politics was ignored after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Möllen.
After the fire of Solingen, he sent a guidegram to the Turkish presidents, but he was allowed to be present at the funeral in Cologne, but by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was then counting on how many charges these Turks had been charged.
As a whole, the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current media reporting again shows how deep the mystery of many Germans in this legal state is worse.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive declaration and reassessment of extreme terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurich
The most ambitious bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The U.S. went into the financial crisis almost to the bank and either of the next crisis shuts down.
Now it's going to be a German.
That's what Axel Weber probably didn't think.
After his spectacular departure from the summit of the Bundesbank in July, it was announced that it would take almost a new job in 2013: President of the Governing Council of Switzerland, U.S. U.A. - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was happy publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the U.S. for its new solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The U.S. has created the tournament."
"I welcome the cooperation with Kaspar Williger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it became clear that everything would come quite different.
A trader in London had crossed all the bank’s security systems and sold around 1.7 billion euros.
U.S. President Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's famous banker, had to go.
The President of the Governing Council of the Union has since been called up - and all of them have asked: When will the end come to Axel Weber?
Weber has already been known to advise the Bank of February 2012.
And the Management Board is already taking over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's hard.
He is not a banker, much more economic professor and notation banker, and would certainly have needed a working time.
He then assumes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has demonstrated once again that it deserves the title "largest scandal bank Europe".
Because the U.S. is rich on the one hand - until recently it was the world's largest resource manager - and, on the other hand, closes from a scandal in the next few years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the first so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the U.S. had an excellent reputation.
The image of the moved and solid but also raised Swiss property manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment bank.
Thus, the U.S. 2007 managed with $1.6 billion more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she was represented as an investment bank in the League of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The single banker and many years later bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told me: "My students have always held the U.S. as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I just get so mad?"
He screamed violently.
In 2007, it was first discovered that something belonged to the U.S. vessel.
In the middle of the year, chief Peter Wuffli returned with a surprising return, which he considered to be a high-tech and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, you knew how he went.
The Bank's investment party had requested subprime papers and had to write billions.
To cover this, the U.S. announced a capital increase in terms of money and wrote 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who had been affected by the noses until recently: an intransparable Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so removed that it was not even known its name.
But that was just the first shot.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to report new billions of losses, and the Swiss Governing Council, President Marcel Ospel, 2006 was still the second most paid Administrative Board.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the U.S. was in view of its failure to invest in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved from the state.
The National Bank purchased the U.S. currency for tens of billions of problematic securities, which the Swiss Eid Society gave six billion francs for a force-debt loan that they could provide as a subsidiary of the Bank.
The whole Switzerland was devastated - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it is inhabited by such large banks.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We couldn't save the U.S. again," says Banken researcher Geiger.
At the first disaster, the second one was closed.
For a few months, the U.S. government has capitalised in the U.S. tax struggle and has declared itself ready to issue the data to the existing customers who have been able to withdraw with the help of the Bank of Taxation.
In addition, she agreed to pay an amount of $780 million - as a repayment of unfair profits from these businesses and punishments.
To that end, the U.S. was known as more or less open to help with tax relief.
At the same time, she lost something that has been her capital since she was in the competition for many customers: the Nimbus of Disability.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the President and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in the investment bank through speculation and in the management of assets by aid for tax relief.
And just as something calmed down again, just as you thought, now the U.S. will have it back, as this strange business story follows: A single dealer asks 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going on.
And it will be obvious: With the risk management in the investment bank, it is still not obvious.
"In the case of Aboboli, it is necessary to establish that the risk control has changed slightly," says Martin Janssen, Econom and Financial Professor at the University of Zurich.
The financial situation of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of the U.S. is that it does not have risk control in the grip."
However, it was precisely the idea that the Swiss Bankiers had long been involved in becoming victims of the world's great wealth: there were no too great risks to security for money - it was also possible to combine the world apart from the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' treasures were a symbol of unwavering trust such as Lindt and Springli for particularly noble chocolates.
The centre of the U.S. in Zurich is still suitable for the click of the giant Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
It's already a classic situation.
The bank has its main seat at the Zurich Railway Station, which leads from the main train station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snow covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are impressive, the lodges belong to the highest in Europe.
Juwelier like Tiffany's is found here between Swiss tradition business like the confierie sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank over the Palace of Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The U.S. reception hall is made up of a heavy duty.
Inside the walls are marbled, before there are thick leather belts, along with the bank logo, a large sign signpost for "safe".
The U.S. knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
These ideas of the Swiss Bank have both Swiss Grand Banks, U.S.A. and Credit Suisse, but at some point have been confused or disappointed as the head of a Swiss private bank is found.
He does not want to read his name in the newspaper, but he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the two large banks of business.
The U.S. has become too big, and he finds - especially in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxans have also expanded.
The Swiss had nothing to say back there.
"And if so, they have adjusted the seats of the angels for a long time."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxic Investment Bank that changed the U.S., provided for its first high profits and then the deficit: no European financial institution has lost as much money as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was seen.
"In that middle week, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the biggest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The U.S. Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, politicians volunteered to save the large bank that stood before the bank.
How could you get it?
You talk to Swiss banks, so they see the problem, especially in the size of the U.S.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks joined a violent group.
There was a bank that was already too big for the small Swiss and growing.
The two different banks of the U.S. were complemented by a rich but sleepy bank with the emphasis on asset management in Zurich and a worse but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the international investment banks came to a great deal of money that they could drive a wide range of routes.
Two names are linked to this rise of the UU: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UU Group, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banken researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-tech, communications, which understands a lot of models and statistics, and ospel, the man who worked from the bankhouse to the top."
But Ospel has left to the end of Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the truth," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Overconference came before the case.
Staff members of the U.S. are clearly reminded of the leadership contests on which the Chief Wiffli issued the same password: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the ranks that documented the success of banks at that time.
Then the U.S. wanted to go up completely.
Some steps have already been made.
In the retail business and in the stock trade, she played all over with it.
However, corporate consultants who have been assigned have made a mistake: In international interest business, in the banking language 'Fixed Income', there is a strong distance to the largest banks.
The U.S. has gaps in American hypothetical products.
To close this gap, U.S. took part in an adventure that cost them almost the existence.
In the wake of growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund were invested in American subprime facilities.
She developed into a powerful machine that packed and expanded the securities on American mortgage credits - but also held risks.
Even if other banks are looking for the rise.
"Even in summer 2007, when the American real estate market was in Flamen, the U.S. had bought it," says Banken expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other, when the attempt to get up was more difficult than thought.
Posts at the U.S. have been placed in the locker seat and are awake to this day.
Whoever runs the Grand Bank now has a almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that is capable of handling all the underlying business models.
Banking researchers Geiger already has an idea: Close with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go as far as possible.
But the investment banking is going to crash so hard, so much is now clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian Swiss was actually just thought of as a transitional solution when the bank was miraculously separated from previous Grübel.
In the meantime, he did: he was to keep the U.S. business going on, he shared with the Züricher bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the state in the mid-nine years.
He's sending 3500 seats.
But that won't be enough.
The U.S. needs a vision.
Who is she?
Where do they want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
He's only publicly saying that he and his wife will be looking for a home in Zurich for the first time.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe charged US-Burse
The dramatic recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors for the weekend.
The government exchanges in Athens and Rome remain without force.
The broken industrial production on the continent raised the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the Keim.
The general simplification of the government change in Rome and Athens could not be applied.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been half full in the past week, not half empty - but now the problems were again in the background, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard value noted a trade closure with a minimum of 0.6 per cent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market margin fell between 12.027 and 12.177 points.
The wider S&P-500 index was closed at 1251 points, a minimum of one percent.
Nasdaq's technologist index lost 0.8 percent and went with 2657 points from trade.
In Frankfurt, the Dax was divided by a minimum of 1.2 per cent in 5985 figures.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is moving towards the end of the rise.
In September, companies produced two percent less here than in the premonmonition, as Eurostat reported.
The U.S. investors voted skeptically: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to break free as soon as possible, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment leader Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European public institutions or banks.
Instead, Buffett had a ten-year-old principle over his head and increased to the U.S. technology industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the company's share rate and allowed it to first notice a percentage higher than the trend in trade.
The paper is almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid $170 per piece according to his own data and now earns 5.5 per cent.
The share rate of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 per cent.
The Bank of America showed a 2.6% significantly stronger than the market.
The house slid almost the rest of its share at the China Construction Bank and is worth $6.6 billion for it.
The Institute wants to raise its capital quota with the net profit from the business and therefore to achieve further regulatory objectives.
The air carrier Boeing set up and therefore limited the losses in the dock.
The share won 1.5 per cent after the group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emmirates ordered 50 long-streck machines of type 777 on Sunday and reported the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
In addition to options on 20 other machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
In New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares were transferred to the owners.
719 values were added, 2281 returned and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, 1,38 billion shares 630 in Plus, 1913 in Minus and 82 are unchanged.
Intelligent wars spread out in cities
In many places satacres are considered "problems": however, the high-quality animals are no longer able to move out of the cities, accused experts.
The one who wants to get rid of them quickly: Wars have been in the city scene for centuries, but in many communities there are people's complaints about the pressure and heat of the animals.
This is a means of combating the "problems" so far.
Saats were no longer able to get out of the cities, experts said at the first wheat symposium in the East Fries.
There, professionals from the entire federal area are divided over possible routes.
You are searching for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also brought back the problems in cities to the landscape of the particularly protected salts: the chemical use in agriculture has destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction and the fall of typical broth trees made life difficult for the birds.
Wars are under natural protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 Brutpaerans are located in the West, in the north-west, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, there was a controversial project for mass killing of cows in the country's circle for negative hits.
Critics had referred to the catch of animals in birds and the release of bats as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the collapse, doesn't bring anything," stated the town and rural planner Werner Klöver from empty.
Next with water spraying or falling trees, there are often undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dry out, big colonies split up and spread to other locations."
Deforestation is only possible as an exception to hospitals, seniors or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away anymore."
Without the change, the problem will not be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is thought to be a combination of wild animals from sensitive habitats and lock-ups to relocate them to other places.
On the contrary, the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens for a very different approach to animals were: "A pickle in the face we can end up with the best self-consciousness."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Ascheberger Kröhen teaching path, informing the speaker about the life of the high-powered satikre.
The project will already be accepted by tourists.
Jürgens had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds: "There is every amount of communication that has to say a lot."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legible: Saats use not only tools to get to a nurse’s bed, but also their tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University tested at least four satacres, as far as the intelligence of birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to carry a weapon with stones in order to reach such a target.
Without much training, they recognized objectively the size and shape of a stone to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the pfifies had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers had placed a small enamel with a mottellarve in a narrowed cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the snow.
However, the researchers had attached them to trimmings.
From there all four of the animals formed a hack, and with its help they then pulled the eggs out of the hole.
Three of the four satacres were even on the aid.
Cristian Ronaldo takes Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of Bosnia and Turkey on a cup remained.
Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are also in favour of the EM 2012.
In the playoffs, Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the latest tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Initiated by the double successful Superstar Christiane Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in the game perfect after the 0:0.
The check was right in the play-off back game at the outside page of Montenegro a 1:0 (0:0), after the game was already a clear thing (2:0).
Not yet burned Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland held a locker 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80).
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga Prof. Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41) and Captain Emir Spahic (65) had doubled for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Rote Map (54.).
Bosnia was already divided into the Playoffs for the 2010 WM in South Africa to Portugal.
At the stadium of Luz in Lisbon, Portugal exchanged a measure of start-up.
Ronaldo was hunting a free tours of about 30 metres for early driving in the masks.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed her width and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hours, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English Table Leader Manchester City set a headball on the side of the latte, which, however, does not exceed the Torline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Chechnya
Next came Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Straffa, Stark decided on the sword and showed the Portuguese the silver card (36).
On the other hand, Stark made a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who certainly transformed the Misimovic.
After the break, however, the 2004 European mayor made it clear by four encounters.
For Czechs, Petr Jiracek ended up in 81. Minutes also the last doubts.
In this way, the master of Europe of 1976 is following the EM for the fifth time.
However, the mansion of trainer Michal Bilek with the German legionaries Michael Kadlek (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (FC Nürnberg) had also been happy and had to be in the beginning for a second.
Schlossmann Petr Cech stopped a possible owner by Thomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stefan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic had just passed through the door of Cech in the 40th minute from the direction of the brake line.
After the break, the Querlate had to save for the already defeated world-class waiter of the Czechs, again the FC Seoul stormers had withdrawn (50.).
The door soon before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey then replaced the football Wender of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks didn't get to Zagreb over a 0:0.
While national trainer Guus Hiddink needs to rent as well as secure his place on the World Bank of the Third World in 2002, Croatians should be pleased to participate in an EM round.
Before 31,000 visitors to the Maximir stadium had been able to discover the Turks almost a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance committee only the pofostos, attacker Kazim Kazim, could not break the trigger in the tower either.
But after a second of a second, Croatia took control of it.
Even after the break, the Croats were not allowed to burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, who made it from 62. minutes for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intacht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapatoni goes to EM
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the mansion from Trainer Giovanni Trapatoni, who had already provided the 4:0 success in the game for a preliminary decision, in the 32 minutes leading.
Konstantin Vassilijev (57.) shines out for the guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes from the beginning, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian opposition prevent the possible leadership effort.
In the 32th minute, it was as far as possible.
After a failed break by Castleman Pavel Londondak, Ward was in position and pressed the ball at 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to double the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were due to fly, the Dax companies shared with them on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up appropriate staff," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced on a customer meeting in Beijing.
The membership is currently expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of the world market leader's discounts for corporate software will be doubled from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers live in the Boomland.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Deeply and deeply, Peter Englunds begins a new book "Greed and Strecking. A story of the first world war, tells in nine new cases" with a long list of leading people who go to heart.
Here is a tip how you could go forward: Cut this page carefully and turn it into your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in England’s novelty story very well. And these main people will work as your GPS, as a light tower at these few moments in which you are lost like English men and women in the Nebel of the war and your illusions are relieved.
Peter Englund is a Swiss historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not portray as an "a work of ancient history".
It contains only a few great names, important treaties or famous battles. There are hardly any messengers, angry reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "Emotions, impressions, experiences and voices".
"Greed and trembling" is almost the experience of more than 20 more or less uneven men and women on both sides of the war, from students and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, drivers, and offices.
Some of these people are going to hell.
Some will be caught in war, lose weight, be betrayed or killed.
Every one of these lives flakes like the vocal cords in a church, some come to come, while others are wiped out.
England's book takes away from the ordinary history books.
It also corrects the idea that the first world war was only the dominant position in the Westfront.
"Greed and shake" goes through other warheads with an expert view: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
For the soldiers in this book, beecars, a celebrated Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, sex flights are an unsolved problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war overwhelms the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a Hurrikan Katrina, who reigns after Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and cannon fire in the distance. Will you stay or get the flight?
Who's coming at all?
No one really understands what happens or why this war is going on.
"Superious facts," says England, "are surrounded by confusion, acceptances, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, distortion theories, dreams, alpine dreams and dreams."
"Breathness and shock" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmaster.
Your stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be shocking or exciting, but they are extremely vivid in England of the small collection that is lost in detail.
Many of them are poor and seek help.
In the history of a German student, he says, "Every substitute."
"Serving coffee, false aluminium, false radar rubber, paper binder, wood knobs."
He tells more about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "The meat made from printed rice and baked in hamlet (and last served with a false bone from wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes that were salted with wood."
It said, as he noted, "837 registered food products authorised in the production of Würstchen, 511 registered coffee products."
Some stories are of honor and integrity.
An American recognizes his own thirst for dignity and says about the war: "I feel that despite all of this, what was expected for men was to sit in the living room with the evening sheet or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so, as such a fascated civilization and as it does not give a barbarium behind its own strong and recommended roof."
Again, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that he will not take notice of it or take care of it.
"When you think of giving yourself up, taking a break, you want to think that this happens before a public," he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a convicted man who was held in secret."
Other observations are made by the old Europe, which falls apart, and by new kinds of terrorism.
"The conflict has become increasingly a economic struggle," writes England, "a war between factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the possession of the younger generation": "the word used and ideologically convincing mass murder in the measure that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unprecedented manner and in a way, and there are also freer attitudes like heroism.
In England, the soldiers who actively tried to sign up to a prostitute with a sexual disease to get out of the front.
"The great expression of it can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and injured on their knees, hoping to get into the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were truly confused call him in the eyes, which led to their being blind to the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish version of Peter Graves, England's poetry is beautiful and yet unsatisfied and perfectly fits its human task.
In tens of thousands of small scenes, he begins the way in which the war "simply eliminated uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious Hass".
People start to wonder why their leaders bring them to war.
The best books about the first world war were most popular like Paul Fussels "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romane like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" as extensive historical books.
England's band joins an unconventional space hall.
His book has the most glorious ending I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it here anymore.
But it is as if he had removed us with his book with this page with the main characters before the nose and burned us with a string of wood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned round
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of whom were using drugs.
You had decided to spend the night of Monday on Tuesday because at this time there are not many people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. All the others believed at first to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past week, such as the use of Pfeffer spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the decree and has made housekeepers a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer able to resume.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the Protestants from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared this by observing how legislation has been dealt with in other cities.
A disaster treatment had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called Chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - in order to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit found Montagnacht on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "in the last minute," said someone who was trusted with the orders what was said for a declaration as "precise".
"The few police officers who were involved in my knowledge didn't know it was going to the Zuccotti Park," said one who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the top officials of the resource."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On 14 October, officials wanted to rent the park, but later they returned, as hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned about these plans.
Offices of various police units were involved in the operation of the day of duty, including operating orders from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are normally used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people went into and out of the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the minimum number of people stood in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers stood in front of the exit at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the messages recorded above that flowed from the speakers seemed to attract many Protestants.
When the public officials entered their bright wind jackets in the park, many Protestants simply found their cases together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 no cells would be fixed to give the protestors time to pack their assets and goods together.
Other teams of officials have seen how they gathered in the environment to get in touch with the need for arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, president of the police, said this was about their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop watching the police in the park, and they said that the conduct of the officials had been very serious.
Mr. Browne said that television cars could have been made in the Church Street on the west side of the park photos.
When the police in the direction of the West, through the great crowd on personal matters of the Protestants, including horses, arts and clubs with clothes, moved, their officers followed up the city training that had been abandoned.
Some Protestants who refused to go were thrown outside. Images of this appeared soon afterwards on the Internet.
A main source of protestors was near the kitchen area of the warehouse in the centre of the park position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter join their arms.
And two people stood on trees themselves, said Mr. Kelly.
The officials of the disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were conducted in the park until 3:30 p.m.
The room was closed 75 minutes after the police said it was.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
It came to most of the arrests, as he said, due to "independence and resistance against a arrest".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest uniformed office of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the criminal department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not perform the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In order to access them, a second group of officials were waiting on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortland Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, Barkikaden was built.
It could be observed how these locations from the police continued to spread around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place many officers were observed, many of them with protective scenes, people running outside.
About 28 people are located in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 o'clock in the south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the refence of a police bus.
In one place, the amount was a piece of sperm.
At the end, an officer and a Protestant came into the hospital.
The manager's work will file a complaint against the city due to discharges.
The company, which has lost hundreds of students in the past month, plans to accuse the city on Wednesday because of its inadequate influence on the schools that teach poor students, is not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity the Association, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the exemptions.
Six hundred-two-year-old school assistants, care coordinators and other workers who were the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs on October 7th, described the trade leader as a political case to refuse access to a health fund that the working groups were supposed to have concluded during the last year.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city court, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the budget had been approved in June.
A member of the City Treaty came back and told him that there was nothing specific in the budget that the staff of the school would be released.
The officials of the city court said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. On Wednesday, a press conference will be held to announce the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be filed by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as accused and count eight dismissed workers as complainers who are all colourful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in a position to file the complaint and could therefore not comment on its individual allegations.
According to a New York Times complaint, the company focused on the number of exemptions from schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint due to inequality. It claimed that poor schools had lost more help since they had been financed in a chronic manner.
It shows that while there were no discounts on the States of Iceland and only a few discounts in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants in the districts 8 and 9 were released in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight students who were in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students were living in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighboring parent who can organize funds to get budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 per cent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for the extrafinance for each school entry.
The company also regrets that the leaders of the High Schools were led by language in a memo in Ireland, which allowed the discharge of the management coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: overlay) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's salary list into a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixteenteenth care coordinators were released, not transferred," said the complainant.
Mission ended, Congress ready to understand Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republican and Democrats in Washington would already understand the situation in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolution, the arrest and execution of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American invasion.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate adopted a resolution which, together with Senator John McCain (Arisona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), endorsed by President John Kerry (Massachusset) and the U.S. troops for their "dead" in Libya for the successful rebellion.
"This resolution commends the courageous people of Libya who started rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but it has not been easy in the Libyan debate before.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House dispute the choice of a number of resolutions for the creation or representation of the role of the US military in NATO's Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution which allowed the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was issued in the Senate by a broad group of two parties, and it came to no vote.
However, on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber voted in favour of reducing the funds for American operations in Libya.
This led the US mission to a kind of legislative fire - with a convention that had been held enough to criticise Obama in advance within the mission, but not hot enough to finally remove him from the ground under his feet.
Then the unanimity of the Congress was overemphasized by the events.
In August, Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Committee's resolution on international relations "gratuises Libyans with their great courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-restraint" and "the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners, who support military operations for the protection of the people in Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Are the new measures fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board, or will they be broken down by the lawmakers, as the law of June has done?
The last sentence is based on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugars spoke on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the chapter, it is in the Senate to agree this week on a constitutional change which requires a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every period of Congressary and certain Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or in another area, which will come at the time of the vote at the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried successfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Good luck is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and includes a whole range of topics.
Some are doubled - the same law has been proposed for both the Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone, and another dozen of them would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - in particular the beginners of the Republicans who want to improve their course of life - the possibility of saying that they have "constitutional" such action.
The budgetary control legislation adopted in August calls for both the Senate and the Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that can be submitted by the members of the Congress, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wishes to limit the limitation on the two official times of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage under equality is as a change that prevents the burning of prisoners, a constant proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States refuse to do so.
As bold as the Members propose changes, they move as quickly as they have in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, 77 such amendments were proposed by lawmakers at 110th Congress 66.
The time is reduced in comparison with the early 1990s, in which members regularly propose more than 150 amendments every two years, the figures made available in the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but has already been proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"To meet but not to win," said Giffords in the first television interview after the interview
Ten months after a armed man had shot her during a election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on the national television. She sang only to the Broadway section "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that she wanted to get her as much as she wanted to go back to the convention.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared in the ABC messages "20/20", she ran to words and needed help to go.
The message showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bullet shared, the left-hand side of her brain, and the head of her head stretched from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she returned to the convention with surprise to express her voice at the door.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford laughed and sang - and described her release as "hard".
When Sawyer asked them how they felt, Gifford answered (41): "Good luck."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a unique "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the wife: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special is following Gifford's generation since the attack on January 8th.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first week, you see her in the hospital bed, with a cool pink head and a long neck over the stars.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she carries out simple movements.
A nikken with the head.
A cup of tea with the lip.
And then their first words are, "What?"
After a few days, Giffords has a second word: "Toast". You want her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's generation: You see how the congressmen sing together with the therapists at Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wana Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours each day with therapy, said that she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12th he had read an article of a daily report about the attack, when she interrupted him and asked for the first time after the six people who were killed during the attack.
The necessary protection of Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is severely medically treated while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"heart, heart, heart."
During the marriage of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you haven't been seen," said Kelly.
You just got caught.
And you'll get through it and you'll get it, and you'll get back stronger than ever.
The troops received more guidance than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala that collected millions of dollars for undiscovered veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sings a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a stickword, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The amount in black foamings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the charity in the spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things by the Chief of Staff and the then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as children," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers have meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was mercy.
The sharp opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most remote, sometimes surprising American public.
The troops are often overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the lobby has its price, say service members.
The public is growing as they do people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, the troops in Iraq ordered and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support them is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not appear undisclosed or in conflict with the public they serve.
They have also found that the forest that returned troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse than it was.
As a result, discussions on membership in the style and privacy of war veterans are held.
After his two sons returned from war with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of respect as they conquered rebellions and fled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "extraordinary, violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took up a lofty state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he said that some of the respondents asked subtil if he was able to stand up to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions," Kancian explained to his sons.
The lack of flexibility of the military is due to the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield will be taken by a country that has little experience with the military and sees only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely taken out as a lobby.
"We as a nation don't value military heroism as much as it was in the second world war," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of a servant.
Groups will find recognition for the number of attacks they have committed, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military is the growing pressure for hard transitions in the administration.
This week, an important hearing will be held on whether 28 women and men are accused of rape in a military court.
Unless it comes to this, hundreds of complaints are prepared for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant on the 11th week when she was raped by a military colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her casino in Miramar north of San Diego from the evenings with a friend when she met a male colleague who took a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if she should accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm clocks went up," said Lyman.
But the Texaner increased their thinking.
I thought, "What, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my feelings."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man followed her, pushed her down and raped her, arrested her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military representatives were waiting for a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a complaint they have filed against former defence minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld will be allowed before court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread violence within the military and undermining the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint was filed at the beginning of 17 complaints, but the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men all claimed to have been raped or abused by military colleagues, and that the military failed to detect, prosecute, or make an appropriate legal statement after the partial attacks.
Burke says she's following the highest military command, as the problem begins there.
"The military has been built hierarchically," she says.
"Who are the individual people who are in the position to expel the culture of which? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted about 400 more survivors, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Its strategy: Instead of putting all the complainants in a basket so that they can put their eggs in a basket, they will submit many more complaints, if necessary, to receive the press directly.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, commissioned by the Federal Government Officer Neil MacBride, has asked for a complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are the case in Newsweek, are explicitly the defence strategy, firstly, that the military cannot be charged with any damage caused by the current or former soldiers to whom it has arrived in the armed forces.
Because of a law of the Supreme Court of the 1950s, the so-called Feres Doctor, the government does not have to pay for injuries which are added to the current service of soldiers.
"The possible damage occurred during the military service of the complainants," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence rejects every comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not yet allowed to serve in the struggle, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars have only very clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in the war areas.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints, except for her, are binding.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four major military cadmiums due to the need to promote a female hostile atmosphere.
In spite of this, the joint ventured Vietnam Veterans of America raises a complaint against the military, in which one focuses on the diagnosis of "individual personality disorder", the rape victims received to release them from the service - a common practice known as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the administration of the war veterans) in which they prevented their discriminatory practices in their dealings with performance requirements for persons engaged in sexual abuse in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress offering a number of reception points.
According to the 2010 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Ministry of Defence.
However, most of the deficits are not reported at all, and this figure takes into account about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report published in March also examined the prosecution rates: 20 per cent of the cases reported in the military before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The complainants in Burkes case describe their attacks as just the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported that the military police had been forced to rape less than an hour after the accident.
On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole number of police officers, doctors and commanding officers.
She had a measure of rape and the blood of her attacker, who was from a cut in his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before she died.
Six people said as characters in the name of the forced act that was finally released.
"I still remember the day when the sentence was read," says Lyman.
"I thought we'd use it. I ran out of court. "
"They brought me into the psychiatric department, and I remember that when I returned home, I said to my commander, "It wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to search for a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and explained it for service.
In January 2010, she was immediately released, so she received no support.
Whether the complaint filed by Lyman and the other complainants is a clear speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "I think they should come."
What lies between them and a court case is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm currently a critic of the Fairy Doctor.
The military is a decade ago, because they do not have the same attraction and the same cut-off that brings a burden to themselves.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the lawyer's lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Words have eyes: How Researchers Watch You Watch on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many young people who sent their anti-transmission opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who was in charge of a massacre in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have worked alone, he is also not alone in cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time in front of his computer and has been charged with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find it?
This is easy - you only have to log in on Facebook.
"We have found it not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British Idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook Hide of personal data is so enzyclopadic, Bartlett says that researchers need to simply use the website's website's advertising tool to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as the marketers have done for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of associating with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users were invited to a survey, in which they were asked for their status of education, their attitude toward violence and their appreciation of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 members of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a real new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online breeders of right-wing groups are mostly young, male and concerned about immigration.
But in a manner of surprise, "those who combine their online activity with an offline activity are more profitable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factory, medical researchers and political scientists use the page to study everything from health questions to social trends such as "likes", text messages and statistics.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day to the average, Facebook generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works on this page in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, it's all gone - you're going straight to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and address social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their complete conversation on Facebook are more likely to drink less of the problem than students who struggle with this subject.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as housing consultants, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many statistics.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify threatened children who would not otherwise have been found."
Moreover, Facebook regularly captures the data of its own population.
The page's database has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, selection of the 2010 elections and a national Glucksindex (which were used in the first line only on Facebook access - Master of digital freedom has known for a long time that the page should make its large database available for other research purposes.)
However, Facebook users know that the page watches it whether they want it now or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is away from thousands of miles, you will be allowed to share your personal data on the page.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know anything?
While researchers have strictly established guidelines on how to collect their data online, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it's only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the details are true in a user profile and in attachments.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So, despite his age, Selwyn thinks as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a stick are still the best research tools that anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out in the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of the social environment - and every amount of social life remains offline."
"Handy and Inhuman": Other Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Another Behring Breivik, the man who had two amoklauds killed in this summer in Norway, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Norwegn's Temperritter," he said before a court hearing with more than 500 people.
"I appeal against the court because you have received your mandate from organizations to support Hassidiology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't blame myself."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, as he "he didn't want to give Brivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to use Breivik, who made a written statement, the permission to return to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also arranged that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will check all visits and the total correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind lock and ring.
Everyone shared the goal that everything should go on a move.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian NRK sender.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it's going to be a bit more after I saw and heard the suspects."
Breivik took a dark approach and a blue tie and acted peacefully and professionally throughout the entire hearing. He watched journalists and survivors in the eyes as he carried out and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's strange hint, he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not spiritually sick and said that there was no evidence that he had complications.
It may have happened to some that the attacks of July 22 appeared to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the room and confusion that still scares a whole nation?
"I wanted him to look like a monster, but he doesn't do it," said the victim's representative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compare him to Henry Ford and prefer technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple-Fans may find in the most recent recent job interview, which was created this week before special film performances on the major markets, is how much this creative head of business has understood processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even a renowned hippie, but he was also an acribian organizer, who devoted himself to diagrams - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from "a disease of mind" "that a really great idea produces 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of manual art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fachidiotes" about the interruption of the personal computer. And he spent more than an hour with jobs, in which they conducted one of the rare, exciting conversations.
At this time, more than 10 years had passed since Apple was forced out of jobs. And he was already working hard at his new company NeXT, and he was happy for the wide use of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he says that the copies of the interview were missing during delivery.
A complete VHS copy was discovered in the manager's garage just after Job's death.
This easily redesigned film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes into the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who knows that he has taken out extensive interviews, Jobs here appear to be extremely zealous in explaining his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incrediblely suspicious.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds later, in which the job clearly reflects his thoughts and strives to be accurate.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes at day when he seems to react impatiently to Ringelly's questions and tends to get him into more important issues and topics.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview seems to be something mysterious if jobs evaluate what other companies think is right or wrong and their own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthume claims of career Jobs. But Jobs here as the beginning dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Soon after he had done all this here, he went out and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of lost interviews:
As he learned to run a company:
"For all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why do you know things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one really thinks about things.
That's what I found.
Jobs will continue his efforts to rationalise the accounting with Apple.
Remarked as costs were recorded - most started with "standard costs", which were applied to mere confusion and then adjusted to "dispersion" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the cost could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was cursed:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that was able to connect to the telephone company and to conduct foreign talks.
The device has already been written a lot, but Job's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization, is remarkable.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a responsible phone, act on a call and then connect to another AT&T network, while passing as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a thousand times around the globe, and when you called, it came back a minute later on the phone," Jobs says.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would give without them Apple.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious string, the Wozniak and he had taken almost off when they called in the middle of the night through Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were so well able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called up in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomats, the two had to leave before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he loved the technology (and unpretentiously called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for replacement parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone, she received jobs for the summer part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable effect on me. It was the only company I had seen in my old age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs of one of the HP employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever built."
He was as big as a boxer, had a small screen with Braunscher Röhre, and I loved him.
I'd stick up at HP as a teenager and rely on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Many times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to find spontaneous new products.
Earlier in his career, when he built some platinum, he was asked by a customer to compile the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the composition and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the overwhelming arguments... they swore to me that it would take five years to build a wall that would cost $300 and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Nine days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredible.
Over large companies remaining:
Long before he re-lived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrialists were engaged with their vision in columns and lost control of their actions.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, then?"
They own the share monopol, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [i.e. such people], which ultimately lead the companies and the product that people are forced to make.
The product gene, which has led to this monopolisation, is driven by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - hand art is necessary.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times larger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
They've cleared the floor of the victory.
About Innovation as an art form:
"There is every amount of craft between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You're learning a lot about his qualities.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to notice 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes on to the taste, it goes beyond trying to be with the best witness that humans have created, sets them apart, and then tries to bring these things together to what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, make great artists.
We're always very good at making great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh did great was that the people who work there were musicians, artists, artists, zoologists, historians, and eventually the world's best computer scientists.
Had it not been the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dance with the adoption of health laws, as a court case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the political issue of whether a violation of President Obama's health law would be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was asked by the Chancellor to present the case before the court.
The case took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the requests for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint that 26 countries have raised against the broad reform of health, which was decided by the Congress last year, a law that was violated by conservatives throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to listen. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion will be expected in March, which will probably lead to the 2012 presidential contest, which will be fully in place at the time of the decision of the Court.
The lawyer who stands before the court and is accused of breaking the law is probably Paul Clement, the first general government attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two thousand companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an ageing group that focused on protecting conservative legal principles.
Another company that represents the Diner Sponsor, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which adopts the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is deeply involved in the results of the process.
The dinner was located a few hours after the court had consulted the case, in a Washington hotel.
The service included Mitch McConnell, head of the Republicans' Group in the Senate and a clear opponent of the health reform
The guest of the dinner?
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably be subject to the Code 4c, which states: "A judge may take part in legal proceedings closer to and other organizations, where the judge cannot be a speaker, honorary or programmed to be a guest of such an event."
On the other hand, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the Chancellors involved in the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert moral-and-government activists.
"This confusing breach with moral and the contrary to the Codex condemns the complaints of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil law movement in the United States.
"The judges won and graduated during a benefit-making event with lawyers with soft procedures at the court."
Their presence and their support for a grant action for this event undermines any claim for impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little feedback to critics who say that they would easily interfere with groups led by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Gini is a well-known conservative activist.
On the contrary, the conservatives claimed that it was Judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general state lawyer under the Obama government when the first legal proceedings were brought before the Court.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of prejudice, because they were too committed to the defence of the law in order to be unconstitutional.
Kagan doesn't make any arrangements to do this.
Boeing pays a record mission of 18 billion dollars to land
Flight company Emmirate ordered 50 two-wheeled aircraft from Type Boeing 777 with an option of 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It's really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company of the air carrier Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is totaled at a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Also unusual is the driver of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need $450 billion in the next 20 years, 2.520 aircraft.
Boeing announced his greatest assignment for commercial aircraft on the weekend, measured at the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer airport came from Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai Aircraft Schau, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total listing price at $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improved the gas consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"It's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a mayor of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they don't only have the money to pay the aircraft. More is an increase in oil prices that usually damage airlines, since this is one of their largest cost points, not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to drive less than other airlines to steal or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emmirates confirms Boings' leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep the airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the pre-authorisation with the A350.
Boeings Victory on the airway will come four months after Airbus announced, the introduction of the largest A350, which is directly competing with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was made to gain more confidence after the customers had asked for a higher benefit and range.
Boeing shares rise by 1.5% to $67,94.
The Mexican President's sister apparently lost the election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer against Fausto Vallejo has supported the PRI in running the government posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her application for the office of Governor Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed that on Monday, drug dealers would have affected the race for the benefit of one of her opponents.
Following the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the run for government posts in the western state by the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The introduction of organized crime during the entire election process and especially on the coming day is alarming, not just for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... You have occupied electoral cabinets, built street blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have shot only a few times, which was still leading in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Action National PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvana Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, who is currently an active governor, came to the place of Trie, a difficult sub-position for the presidential election of 2012 and a strong and happy link leadership.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, lies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in Marihuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates were afraid of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, regardless of how strongly the elections in Michoacan appear too.
The man who is likely to be represented by the PRI in the run for the presidential office, Enrique Pena Nieto, who graduated from Washington, said: "I think this victory will give us courage in the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its heavy debt crisis to prevent a long-term decline that will slow Asia's economic growth.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB administration with a seat in Manila, said that both of the world's fastest growing economies "all in power" must be done to speed up the recovery of the currency block either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who looked at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources would help to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy through Asia.
"We're all sitting in the same boat."
"So is everyone helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
In the past months, the European currency union has been in a heavy debt crisis.
In the past days, Italy's customs costs are at risk and the Prime Minister has returned from Italy and Greece.
The emerging heavy debt crisis in Europe suggests that the global economy could collapse into the recession and led to calls for the leading debt countries to come together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag said that any support for Asia would be channelled by the IWF, but he said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue funds, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) - would offer European partners in Asia greater negotiating power.
And Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy now leads to the decline in exports and the withdrawal of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro zone to remain stable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to achieve a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because elsewhere we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as India, are not allowed to help the many Europeans if they are themselves facing major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India for Europe, of whom more than 800 million are living or less than $2 a day.
"At the same time, they will find out that the Greeks go in interest with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economy Forum, asked why India's reserves should be used to keep in Greece the many and well-paid employees in public service, with jobs in bad condition, lost institutions such as the railways.
Mr Naga said that the crisis in the Eurozone would have "significant domino effect" throughout Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the year 2011/is now "the risk of abortion" due to the alarming danger of Europe.
He said that harmful forestry markets had to create "crisenplans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant increase in capital formation in their economies.
Urgent warnings from the pentagon before possible interruptions in the protective tissue
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta attended the convention on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security, thus opening a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the warheads in Afghanistan and the civilian air exchanges.
The pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now feared that further cuts will be needed at $600 billion or more if the convention cannot reach an end in expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be commendable for the ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement leading to such a decision would result in 23% of general cuts and a peak of many new projects.
"So a high cut, carried out in such an unexpected way, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects ineffective - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves voluntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians with limited certainty to reach the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who receive our military directly and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts finally met the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents are not directly affected by the decision-making, the difficult impact on the basic budget would have a significant impact on the efforts of the war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been cut down which would lead to delays in the settings and the configuration overview that would support the war."
"The staff's holders would be cut off, which would lead to late payments to wartimers and would violate the legal and political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a decision by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military force of the world."
"We are strongly opposed to this dramatic action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it's certainly no one to force us."
"The decision is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to enter it."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to take out the Friday of cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly voiced the possible cuts, although she was able to collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and the White House before she came to the summit of the Pentecostal, and she knows that she is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence took a sad picture of what might happen - a soldier with a sword but without a core.
"It's a ship without matros."
"It's a bridge without munition."
"It's an air-armed gun-fighter without a sufficient charge of pilots."
"It is a piece of paper, an army of casinos, buildings and bombs without sufficient dedicated soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening speech at the Pentecost.
"It is a struggle which is lacking in moral and alertness and which is not able to take it with potential enemies."
"It lets be really hot."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how "significant operational risks are created: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious restrictions on our world-wide capacity for use and recovery, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects of the strike could happen to victims, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic U-boats, the new Littoral Battle Ship and the new underground vehicle, the army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If it were to stop further development and testing of F35, this would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the sponsors would say that it is a more important step to repair, so that possible risks can be linked by China and other opponents.
How to Avoid a Lie
A look at the current figures shows how suspicious and widespread confusion and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate for the Republican, Herman Cain, is working to become the accused of sexual abuse by several women. Both sides are involved in the lie.
The leadership of Penn State is charged with the fact that there are reports that a retired football trainer has been sexually abused.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy accused American President Barack Obama of being a liar by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
False corrupt careers and corrupt countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a narcissist when he started a story that was quickly rejected by undisputed evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is charged with the failure to finance the campaign, which is linked to the replacement of an extraordinary deal.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it has forgotten the media circus, which President Bill Clinton has solved when he has lied to Monica Levinsky during his second office time in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky.
History of fraud in school and college trials has been widely spread.
There were cases in which teachers gave their students the exam answers so that they could get well into their performance exams.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and gossip are okay.
How much confusion do we experience?
As studies show, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, serve as reminders.
Another study shows that the stranger is present three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or to "discover lies" is one that is important for every person, and this is for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as a drawback, in which the goal is to call "Have you!" is to draw up a series of sciences based on scientific data collected in the past six decades to the universities, which have carried out extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most old myths were raised over the lie.
Lies look one in the eyes.
They stop, stop, grow up, and don't always jump.
However, it cannot be concluded that these lies are difficult to detect and detect.
A well-known doctor can go through the truth by learning something about the structure of the arrest, the fine facial expressions, the question and timing.
I've spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of exclusion. And it is clear that the removal of a tension is a modern capacity that is easy to learn and helps us in our complex world, especially if the establishment or question of persons or negotiations or administration is related to our own professional responsibilities.
Good lies are very good to appreciate other people's interests and to control their own emotions, and they smell intuitively how they are taken from others.
Thanks to the research we know that extroverted people often lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often "self-oriented" lying than women who lie more "orientate themselves" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often accused of their partners than unwed people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fatly lies").
We also know that when a person is expelled as a rival, others feel less guilty of having joined him.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
It's called "baselinering", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluations of changes.
Watch the attitude, the lips, the voice quality of their test person.
They should know better when a person normally tries with his foot, so that they do not accuse him of injustice when he walks in a fight with his foot.
Then pay attention to invitations to more casual and nonverbal behaviour.
View these attachments as alarm clocks that scream, not as evidence of a withdrawal.
People who are confused may wake up when they try to remember their history. Maybe they show their feet towards the door or they lean toward the exit direction, change their position in a significant way or show a "response after the setup conversation", this deep, relaxing look and change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questioners often signal that a configuration dialogue is in progress only to keep an overview after this delay.
Also focus on the language of your test person.
The expositor of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the form of the past, when he claimed, his murdered wife was still alive and a national search for her.
Vulnerable people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Vivinsky" or if you have repeated a serious question in the whole.
The most common white marks are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a queer question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to the best knowledge and knowledge."
In this way, the answer is more serious than the fact that the alarm clocks often shout.
There is no magic device to remove lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which removal is possible.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can rarely be the victim of abuses, both in private and in professional life.
Reconstitutional plan of an oil pipeline will be revised after a threat by delayed US acceptance
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, where the companies were damaged and the same environmental defenders, the Pipeline building companies are trying to redesign the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be removed from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Purbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will finally be approved, even with another pass.
This was followed by a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal contract was to be rejected until the new possible operation was checked, which included the Sandillas region in Nebraska and the Ogalla-Aquifer, a large supply of water.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may reject a decision by 2013, following the elections in the coming year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would be able to pump 700,000 oil daily from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
In this case, the Pipeline had to pass through six countries.
They have environmental protection, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the Pipeline is creating 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weaken the laws to force a withdrawal from the region of Sandhills and the Ogalla-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and sanitation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy industry said that the primer of the ministry called for a separate sin of the review procedure, focusing on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist, founded by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was the 2008 consultant of Hillary Clinton, was involved in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inadequate choice as it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle complains that she seems to be forced by a child of fear to break up.
A New Yorker family claimed that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had received a suicide attack that would have put her little daughter in such fear that she had passed away in fear.
The thirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer, 18 months old Genevieve Monk, was so afraid that she was suffering from "personal changes, loss of sleep" and "greater fear of strangers", said her family in front of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was the last year of November 10, when the pioneer worker Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, wanted to break into a family flight, and Genevieve.
While Kevin Monk was driving the car, Roseanna Monk went with the bag and Geneva on the arm to the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said that she had stayed near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone looked behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to get her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle reminded the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't have your daughter sit near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to laugh - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to tap water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you have done with my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle was shocked at the mother who still took Geneva on the arm, and had to stay away from her companion and be taken to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby cried so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family wrote about an apology, but no answer was received.
LaBelles Lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a no-closed set of damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he did not take into account honour and that the family plan, the money they get, will be spent on childcare assistance.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take over responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed by a child nurse against the day that an 18-month-old baby wears on the arm."
Climate change is the fastest economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments returned and the economy increased.
In 2011 the economic history of Sinaloas will remain in mind. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who is himself the founder of the change and has expressed great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, because of the climate conditions, growth cannot be the talk, but the most important economic indicators have failed.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses to millions in agriculture, but also reduced the growth of the state economy to some limits, and in the first quarter caused a overall decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent, mainly due to the historical development of agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which had an impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report issued by the Council of Mexicoo para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (e.g. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land used were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 per cent had been destroyed.
The decline in economic activity has continued to slow down in the Mexican state. In the first quarter, the Instituto National de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55,053 of the inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, representing a 4.53% of the population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6,19 per cent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa.
Low liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa goes back to several factors in the year. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the University of Autónoma University of Economic and Social Sciences (UAS), comments that public institutions' policies are indirect in terms of increasing unemployment.
"What we have now seen is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the legality of the media, which has been adopted to combat money laundering at the Congress, because it is not easy for those who purchase prohibited dollars to work for themselves, invest them or use something else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has gone back. This is on the one hand to return to the problem of entry and on the other, because it is also difficult to find work. These people stay here and look for work that leaves them unemployed," he says.
Black Work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult when it takes into account the high proportion of black labour. This includes, according to INEGI 60.38 per cent of the workers in the country who work without paying in the social security cases.
The low wages, the lowest in all Mexico, are due to unemployment and black labour, according to statistics from the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labourjo y Prevision Social (Governmental Office for Labour and Social Services in Mexico).
The average monthly income of the workers in Sinaloa remained until September 5352 pesos; this is much less than the total average of 775 pesos.
ADI's retreat
In addition to the development of economic activity and growing unemployment in 2011, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) has been reported in 2011. According to the Secretariat of the Economy (State Economic Authority), the ADI is estimated at US$ 630,597 in January to June, which represents an estimated 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretariat of Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development), on the other hand, refers to a total investment of 17,280,000 people in 2011, which consists primarily of enterprises from the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the Government of the country at the National Congress requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities. The country Congress approved an amount of 200,600 000 pesos, but by November it could not have established any positive effects on any of the economic partners in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the company, Mario López Valdés made the government’s capacity manifest in the first year of government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara National de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the processing industry in Mexico), believes that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the Government of Mexico.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really necessary in this year. It must be worked hard to restore the land lost in this year and we must try to double our efforts in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already agreed government teams have not been sufficiently agreed," he said.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the cold at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and long-term.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the cold. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to develop a dynamic economy that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefined Appointments
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Intrepreneur band Mexicoos) in Sinaloa, said that the State should be allowed to operate dynamically.
"In general, we have observed that it has been worked. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to reassess the economic profession and the country's line, as it is important to activate all the material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would reduce government efforts in better ways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has come ahead, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current State power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has dealt more widely. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still much work ahead of it," he said.
Concentration due to 8 kg Marihuana
Five years of imprisonment and 100 days of imprisonment, a population of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of Marihuana.
The State authorities of the Republic announced that the drug dealer Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - this is Marihuana's particular possession for trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in monitoring the Cipriano Valdez road against guard No 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was in a white delivery car in which he kept a black smoke in a box in the car and on the parking lot, where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the contested goods were handed over to the district judge and the penalty continues to be in the enforcement agency.
Debts for construction work
The social constructions for migrants in the programmes of Hábitat, Recate de Spacios Publicos and 3x1 are in danger of not being produced due to the lack of funds or simply with great disappointment, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Mayor of the City Authority for Social Development explained that although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger because the government has not paid the funds it has spent on the three programmes of 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, 25 percent of which fell to the state. To date, only the Federación and the community had contributed to the construction work, so that it would be expected to delay the construction ban.
"12 million will have to beat them, and even though the year is to end, they have not given us any money, and that, although they have already paid us a part in July," he said. "To be not late, we have already started with the construction work, and they have already made much progress, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, so at the beginning of that time the Community had to receive a loan of 7 million.
"This has been the case for us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continue to exist, and this year we had to create the funds that the State had not taken to participate in," he said.
Even if the public authorities are obliged to pay this amount, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was asked to speed up the administration work and to pay the outstanding amount as quickly as possible.
"At least 12 million will have to beat them, and even though the year is to end, they have not given us a pfennig."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogues into digital signals is one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) has shown the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidyary House and has the power to submit analogs to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes which are necessary for legal enforcement.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the bill with the details of the operation on the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute in the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to enable the court to decide whether the constitutionality or non-constitutionality were decided. The law remains in force.
The draft complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero was proposed to clarify the legislative code for constitutional reasons, since the Commission is responsible for radio and television regulations, the Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico, which would therefore be contrary to the hierarchy's principles and to the provisions of the law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the members of the Chamber refer to constitutional complaints against the bill. Following the adoption of the complaint, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer appealed to the bill and introduced all activities for the establishment of the digital transfer.
The Council of Ministers also raised the complaint filed by the Chamber without participating in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister did not agree with the arguments of the project, but in the sense that the Government of the country should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration.
"I also do not believe that if you do this, the independence of the regulatory system would be affected," she also recalled that for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because this leads to state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The changes in translation, she said, were an increase in the use of digitalization, which was a decision in the public interest which was not only technical points of view, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "make the whole system's trade necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they contained a set of features that were legitimised by the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, and even on the government, although they had highly specialized institutions.
It is impossible to conclude that the government, by issuing the proposed decree, has surrendered to the competences of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be in compliance with it," she assured.
The possibility of listing the votes in Michoacán separately will be considered
According to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the election of the Governor is almost 27 per cent, with 879 votes totalling 6074.
The possibility of single counting of votes is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, as according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultsos Electorales Preliminaries (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the government elections is almost 27 per cent, with 879 votes of total 6074 not yet counted.
In this regard, the President of the Council of the General del Instituto Elektoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ánges Länderal Zaragoza, recalled that on November 9th, the election place had adopted a number of regulations to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the Federal States in the event of elections.
It should be remembered that neither his political constitution nor his election law had adapted his law on electoral reform to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they were not in force at this election round. Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel refused to publish its publication in the state witness within the deadlines to which it was scheduled to come with the argument, even today.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaints filed by the local legislation and considered the state authority's voice to the constitutional reforms as "illegal and legal" since it did not have the right to "decision or to impose a Veto against it".
María de los Ánges Länderal explained in an interview on the possibility of the single counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the General Council, the IEM now has the possibility that the local electoral authority may take part or complete the list of votes.
The results of the Protocols may be partly disaggregated under the following conditions: the Protocol on the calculation and calculation of the votes shall not be an actuarial or not in the possession of the Chairman of the Committee of Elections or there shall be manifest errors or changes in the Protocols.
Furthermore, if there is a difference between the required winner and the one on the second place, which is equal to or less than a percentage, the total number of fully completed elections may be expected at the beginning of the meeting, an explicit request from the party or coalition president, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The voting calculation may also take place in its entirety when it is determined that the difference between the potential winner and the candidate on the second place is equal to or less than a percentage, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party which has become second candidate. In this case, the electoral packages that have been issued in part would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second places is almost 0.16 per cent, although the votes of 129 have not yet been counted by total 923.
His last will
His ass is spread over the Zapalinamé mountain, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilots, Felipe Bacio Cortés, slept this Sunday afternoon on Saltillo, his place of birth, below. On Monday the sight of death and a deathmatch took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Superintendent was that his ass would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain.
After a while, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others, returned to the capital city of Coahuila in a car in a Mexican aircraft crash when the accident took place at the ceremony in Campo Marte.
About twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the axle of the Superintendent landed on the trailer located at Boulevard Nazirio Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends arrived.
About 17.30 hours his remains were examined at the Institute of Technology by Saltillo. This bodyview was conducted by his former students from the technical Abitur and his American football team, Philip Bacio during his preparation of the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ass would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Superintendent had fulfilled all his dreams and she thought that he had been in the full of his life. "He was a successful man, especially as a father and as a son, a loving brother and always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés lost the place of Saltillo very young to join Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not catch it because they thought it would even be on a truck quickly. Nevertheless, he always tried to become his dream, his pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He never came to Saltillo, and he already wanted to welcome the whole family, as when he took Martha Sahaccono to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that he was even at seven years of age after Zapopán was in danger of graduating from his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he best liked: fly a plane.
A Last Distinct
The Superintendent of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was appointed under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honour was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the schoolmen and students of the technical education agency of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and attended both the study and the sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when he was arrested by a rapist who was also arrested by State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority.
About 18.05, the sealed remnants of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be handed over to members of the shipping company, led by Major Jaime Martinez, to be handed over by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, sister and other members, students and teachers.
The left body was found on a ground floor at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, military officers presented the media with eleven persons who had been arrested in the same place in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different parts of the body and a glove in a left Finca at Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at a point 1.5 km from Cadereyta to Santiago on the height of the village of El Castillo.

11 Persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa National (State Defence Secretariat) presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a crime that was mainly committed in the Cadereyta area, who were involved in executions, murder, semi-coneo (human-jagd) and domestic investigations.
Following the information made public, eight persons were arrested on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a phone were secured. The prisoners confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".

In the middle of the week, the new Italian Government's education
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this to the new government, which is responsible for the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this to the new government, which is responsible for the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday, to confirm government training.
It will be concluded that he will be presented with a majority of the bureaucracy composed of technocrats, although it is still not clear when the new Prime Minister will be present at his office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on government training.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to complete with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly endorse government education, but his comments suggest that the obstacles are overcome.
"The frame is now well sealed," he added.
Monti has been able to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Still, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has brought the cost of debt to an unprecedented level.
The new government led by former EU Commissioner Monti has to adopt a strong spare package called for by the Europoliters to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on oil, which is charged on Monti, was even strengthened by the changing market, due to the fact that the Italian State loans were charged with 7 per cent interest for 10 years. This is in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcagagglia, president of the Italian Confindustria Industry Association, shared the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The success chances of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to return on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are determined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Central Law Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest part of Italy, is important because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of the existing government, which forms the Monti.
Parliament's support
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the most likely unfavourable savings measures.
Opposition to its efforts or the urgency of the reforms could again result in a growing attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has its hint, a failed Montis is a disaster, as is the press.
Monti started his debate on Monday with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurs as well as youth and women's organisations.
The meeting schedule should be terminated by the service day.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, has put in place an extremely rapid government change.
Following a brief wake at the end of the last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would return, the new Prime Minister's success in achieving the costs of the Italian State Council has again reached critical limits.
An Italian rescue with a state debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government had to wait until the next elections, which were expected to be held in 2013, despite the fact that the politicians were only given time to implement the reforms.
Monti said he would like to take politicians into his office, but the major parties are that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual misunderstandings and differences between the parties make the involvement of people from political life difficult.
Spain has more toys than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on the Buckel.
From the Costa Ricas side, only one of the 22 games intruders has 50 games behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the game of friendship, which takes place today at 15.05 a.m. at San José's National Stadium.
While the world- and European masters, the number one on the FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A elections, the three-coloured man has only over the defense player Michael Umana as one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the room of Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential Premier League Clubs of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup masters) as well as high European Cups such as the League Championships.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish furry comes with complex settlement games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers have several international encounters within the Concaf, which is located on the FIFA range list below.
We will see how the Spanish Mansion sees its last record: The Iker Casillas Tower, which on the last Saturday against England (Netherlands 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games, achieved a match with the former Andoni Zubizarreta tower.
Casillas is today playing against the three-colored man and Spain is playing a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian men who had reached the 100 magic number: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the medium storm of Schalke, Raúl Gonzalez, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also close to Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso followed him with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Inista with 62, Csc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side tower Júnior Díaz has 48 games and the tower Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five on 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least of the games.
Less than 30 games are shown in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santiago Santiago Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the National Mission comes at less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even approach the 20th range.
While Nachha Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, named in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet had their debut.
The historic Torhüter Spain is David Villa with 50 matches followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine of the most towers, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett in Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old heritage
"In Costa Rica to play is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is ready to give the next Sunday at the national stadium of her best concert.
For more than 20 years, they have been expected, but the band ensures that they have a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva the last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will meet at 19.30 a.m. at the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an extract from the conversation to find its complete copy in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream happens when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also works for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've just been to the holiday in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we're going to stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are all over the place. They're experiencing the days before the concert.
What do you say your favorite fans?
Thank you, all these years to be on our side.
We've spent almost 21 years in Costa Rica. Thanks for waiting so long and it's sorry for us, so long as we're here.
Some people even think your concert will become the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have been taking place in the last two weeks.
We've played some Riesenshows in Sao Paulo and we hope they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have fun to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the dschungel. Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves about surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply invisible.
My friends have always traveled to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surf.
With a look at the tour, she has offered her Riesenshows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't have any limits either.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play some songs from each album and offer our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's part of it because we have nine plates and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we have two or three songs that we haven't played anymore, take them into the repertoire, we can get our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why these songs happened to us. Otherwise, they could get confused.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, that's why it's also for the public.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you turn back, will it be hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I believe that none of us have ever imagined to play in a big rock band, and that's over 20 years. It's like a dream.
We also put on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like to play music and we like it.
We are happy to be able to travel to places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to be actively involved at the time of your birth?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We are well acquainted with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing and quite unusual when a movement from a group of friends takes place.
Here and again a band goes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and we feel ashamed to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound gardens on her tour. We are pleased to be still with them all and we are delighted to be part of this popular Seattle Sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours have been with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) stood with us 13 years ago. That's the only thing that's been going on more than many bands.
First of all, I think that we all appreciate our happiness, that we are still in life, and that we also care about each other.
We are all very good friends, which is why we have opened up musical ways that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music. It couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with peace has not always been easy. On the other hand, you can always do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
The way we're grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We're sure not to be too often on tour, because it's too easy to play this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think people have come because of music, you remember that you have to be the music and what they have called into life, be careful, without forgetting to be a famous rock star.
What kind of memories do you have on your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We had been a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were surprised to have spent so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I see a song or photos, I think about what was for an incredible person Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other subjects.
He was an extraordinary person and we lost him.
The Dutch band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Do you agree that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you have examined the band for opening up?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer alive. That's definitely exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledter when you play live?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
For the first ones I like, Geezer Butler, John Enwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass that happened to me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the nest alive, even though it is no longer a fashionable phenomenon?
I think we all don't feel very attached to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are doing better now than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work easily. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which will be replaced as very dark songs, although they also have some positive effects.
The trains came to me both when I heard how Ed played them, and they're very dark songs.
I think if you're older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs will make it clear to me.
But I am also the view that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was introduced to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the loss of his legs, informing his household.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who, for the sake of his 25-year-old hatred for human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has had several diseases, including tooth cancer, which is four times operating and controlled.
Alejandro Agunga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would investigate the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body organs for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto National de Enfermedade Neoplasicas.
Agunga commented that his opinion could be appealed to Fujimori for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not want this because he held him innocent.
He was operated four times on toothpaste and has lost 18 kilos weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a toothache, kidney stones, blood pressure, and bleeding problems in the bones were reported by the doctor.
Fujimori is located in the Haftanstalt National Directorate of Special Police Operations on September 6, 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, who was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official reception, inspired by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs begins their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to discuss trade between the two countries and the political issues of the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican official Philip Calderón next Wednesday. This will be a meeting with the group of Uruguayians who live in Mexico, as announced by the Uruguayan president of the summit.
The discussion of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "appropriate for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", was announced by the President of the South American country's website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks the support of Calderón for the conflict with France, when French Governor Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax paradigms at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy decided to exclude those countries that still appear as tax havens from the international community. This statement was sent back from Uruguay and sent a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been the President of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful and industrial states. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to prevent the double arrangement with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the ratification of the Agreement on the exchange of tax information to be drawn up from the "green list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
There has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries since 2004.
The fast-paced installer joins "Super Mario 3D Country" the third dimension
Super Mario has fought for the salvation of Princess Peach for 25 years, but never until now in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Country", he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which this month comes to the world's cargo tents, has been cut off from the beginning on the properties of the portable console Nintente 3DS, which can be played without a special three-dimensional bridge.
"Mario is the figure that must say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Country" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which was originally developed for this console", because until now there were successful articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adaptations already exist.
Nintendo's speaker stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Country" is a "swift" video game that allows a fast, flexible game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Country" has two games in an embedded: the first part is "light", to capture the less qualified users.
Then the experts can run a "second round" on the different levels of games that become increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can actually choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. To overcome obstacles without sacrificing the "optical effect", however, it must always be played three-dimensional.
This Super Marios trip into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo connects the fans of the Saga and repeats the success of the latest edition: The fast-paced installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player is playing on news on movements, the environment, clothing and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom for the delivery of Portillos in the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this service day that he would take the lead in delivering the former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the money laundering of $70 million.
This concludes the process on the US's request for the delivery of Portillo so that it can be brought before the court.
In a press conference, Columbus confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that during his government he did not intervene in court decisions and that he had taken all the charges of extradition he had taken into account.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities are appointed to condemn the former presidents (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be issued if his case is clarified in Guatemala and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the destruction of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his time of government. This transaction was preceded by the delivery, but the Minister rejected and maintained the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people from social exclusion.
The organization was called to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training in life.
The first 25 years of social assistance organisation Trinijove have had significant results: in this fourth century, 6,000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over one hundred jobs are created for this social group.
At the end of the year, an event was held in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was called to help young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality in 1986.
At the summer festival in San Andreu, a number of responsible bodies and institutions participated in the association that worked together for the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in different directions to electoral times contributed to the impartiality of the work performed by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist Minister of Education Ernest Margall and former mayor and current-green city streets Richard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was called into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work that has been done so far is "a good basis".
For the Presidents of the Generality, Trinijove is an example of the fight against difficult circumstances and of people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is for the unity and the work it does is nothing new," he explained.
The occupied house, in which the rice parties were arranged, was spaced
The owners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building on Sunday morning without resistance.
All of this indicates that the Alps of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the street of Balmes have found an end.
Twelve people left the building on Wednesday morning voluntarily, where they had been illegally detained and in which they had organized huge parties that had brought the neighborhood into doubt.
After the room was removed, the door lock was removed to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the household administrator confirmed.
The housekeepers who owned 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of them lived - took the whole electrical plant and part of the water supply. They also had the walls repaired and left all kinds of furniture, especially doses with alcoholic beverages.
In the three floors, large parties were celebrated, which lasted for up to two days and drove the villagers into confusion.
In addition to the building, there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carries damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained that her business would have returned to 80% since the start of the household budget.
The owner of the discotheque showed that the household owners made their unsolicited competition because they sold the drinks to three euros while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the place of leisure was shown by the neighbors for restlessness, while they said that the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disc, but by the owners of the house, and in particular by the guests of the party who were organised there, and who were more and more, after the announcement of the wounded neighbors in the last few weeks.
The administrators of the discotheque explained that the damage had been so great that they had agreed with the owner of the building that they had to pay no rent for the last nine months.
The Guardian Urbana (city police) also confirmed that they received more complaints from their neighbors in the last few weeks.
The head of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona City, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked for the building to be cleaned up in the last week and to get the problems of civil society as well as the arrival of the city district.
He explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building, but that the houseowners in the last few months had been impressed with all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some it even came to roofs.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to go against the social action in the building."
Last night another building was repaired in the town square of Nou Barris by the Catalan police.
At 15.30 a.m., the police approached the Montral Street No. 35 after they received a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested without delay.
Park or mountain?
The architects are distinguished from the parties about the honours with the statement.
The urban statement on the 16 tower opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona on New.
In the mid-80s, at the height of the broken Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its newsletter on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared to New York Central Park in numbers.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became more and more at the top of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few that do not extend to the north-south direction, but to the top (the mountains) and the bottom (the sea).
The institution of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As a model, not now the Central Park, but Yellowstone with Wildshoes in the role of the Yogibars.
As far as the city was concerned in September, there was a Russian inscription, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a tower refers to the concept of a park.
Either it's like that, or someone's got to put Tore on the ground.
The question is itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The statement is not only an organisational view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the subject of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring subject, which can be referred back to the two members of this old caste that appear on the rise.
And that is exactly what this fact offers for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have been involved in the project.
Miguel Rollan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The description is appropriate.
For Rollan "is necessary" after the attack on the coast on the "Front at the Mountain" until the discourse by Ildefons Cerda, which has been published over the green apples, has been published.
"Man should conclude from the principle that Barcelona is the biggest park of the beach.
Among other things, because he's very accessible.
Collserola is complex," explains the architect, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" creates a "lexical case" in itself: "It is not possible to imagine themselves "as access to a park, but as an introduction of areas to be dealt with."
Modol, like Rollan and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge", the "some dangers" in itself.
Threats resulting from the "unsafety that brings the design of a public space today" after the 1980s, which had their "Schwangengengung" in the Forum.
The first concern is the self-reliance on what can be built.
"This is always a matter of determining the next step," i.e. going over it.
"I have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [particularly on the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which is more concerned with the question, simply means that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park which is not towards Barcelona", and that is for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "stop at the top of the ears", although it is grateful to the city administration that it has given his team the opportunity to interact with this project "from the first moment on".
He also notes that the approach of the mountain to the city of leadership, which enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he does not know whether this technical profile of multidisciplinary teams called life ("just the right") should lead "We architects should be only a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the footnote of this article is complex because in the terms of the statement there is a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 competitions in the framework," he says, "on the Axse Mountain Sea. But there is no long-term perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
This has at least led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a tower with the architect of the tower would be co-ordinated.
According to his opinion, the city should ensure that the columns are equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt throughout its entire length, which creates a weak transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino quits Jonas Larrazabal, who comes free
After 72 days of Sweden, the official of the Casino Red released the brother of the Mayor of Monterey from the process that is being conducted against him because of the possible repression.
After 72 days of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after being released from prison by the official of the Casino Red before the second sentence of the district, which led to the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterey because of his repression.
After paying attention to the casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas is to see, which must be obliged to pay for a sum of money in order to allow city administration the secret operation of the weather house.
After the trial, the State authorities opened a trial against the brother of the Panistic Mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministry of Publico 3 and Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio Antiguo, the capital.
At this point, he remained 49 days after a second warrant, after the officials of the Ministry of Publicity had prosecuted the crimes for the arrest and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's port station because he must have been the owner of the Casino Red with a million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in the middle of the security treaty, as murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court procedure as a prisoner of the urban prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was appointed by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, as a court order, which established that there would be sufficient evidence to provide sufficient evidence after almost two months of investigations to inform Jonas of the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the weather house in order to open it against.
This morning, the official of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother to grant the sentence, so that he will be put on his free foot in the next hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the officials of the Ministry of Justice, Público, García Gómez, asked whether they were in need of damage and who the owner of the house had said he was guilty.
According to the Act of 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is free to speak. As a result, no complaints can be filed against the process, and no damage will be required.
Following the hearing of the official of the Wetthouse v. 15.50, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately put on his free foot.
The judge, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolas de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonas that he had been free to speak and that his case would be brought to justice.
He also informed him of the legal arrangement for the inalienable release.
The Secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, has details about the crash, where government Secretary Francisco Black and seven others have come to life.
The Secretariat de Communicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident involving government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others about life indicated that the kidnapper was directly spoken against the ground with his entire unmanned structure without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of communication and transport, said that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller planes had contact with trees in 25 meters high, where the hijacker lost the noise seems to indicate that the helicopter had several underground contacts."
He also explained that the hijacker was built for 19 inches, so he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that during the studies on the area on which the machine was located, no hives were found.
"In the search, no parts of aircraft were found at other locations, which dealt with the entire structure.
The hijacker was built for 19 inches, so he fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The area shows a depth of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is essential to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this may take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports y Servicios Auxiliaires (Secretariat for Aircraft and Aid Services in Mexico), assured that the hijacker from the State Major President was flying at the speed of the flight and that the aircraft had fallen off a soft turn.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the launch."
At a press conference, the leaders of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, referred to six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
_Visibility rate:
In line with the flights, it was a flight according to the rules of the flight. This means that the man had to have a sufficient view during the flight and on the ground.
Conditions of competition:
The AICM listed appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the follow-up to the border area between Mexico City and Mexico, some deep-rooted clouds appeared.
Selected sizes:
It is possible that the man chosen a lower area with a better view to the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Output device:
The initial coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. It is possible that before the launch, there was no loss of control over the aircraft or a discrepancy of the plane.
Extension of the excess of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information available up to now indicates that the hijacker has been raised from the right and from the left.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft may suggest that the hijacker was mounted on the ground with its undiscovered structure.
No reference to fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft will not be able to stop on fire or on explosion.
The last results of the investigation show several ground contacts.
During the on-site tests, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The ground is sharp and shows a depth of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the Hubschruber is probably going to break.
Some information suggests that the Hubschruber may have had several underground contacts.
After a demining search in a area that is outside the closed area of the accident, no widespread parts of aircraft could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the uninterrupted aircraft structure was spoken against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for fattyness
The Social Insurance Institution of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for pregnancy in children and young people supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicoo del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institution of Mexico) announced that there is a research project for the detection of the gene for pregnancy in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of pregnancy in childhood and youth" that should be found in relation to genetic markers.
Miguel Cruz López, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Biochemica (Apartment for Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Specialities del Centro Médico Nécional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, food professionals and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate studies at the Instituto National de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico National (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the IMSS sports sites in the valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out every Saturday at 8.00 a.m. with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sport site of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of Mexico) and continued on the sport site of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
When the goal of 500 to 600 surveyers is achieved, the study will be continued at the sports site of Independencia (South of the capital district) and concluded at Morelos (Northern of the capital area).
He explained that the study was aimed at identifying factors and the role of genetics in relation to the development of pregnancy and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he explained that it would be expected that three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years of age should meet the understanding and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that may have an effect on diabetes or kidney failure.
He further indicated that during the said summer the test subjects (weight, size, size), their blood pressure would be controlled and blood levels such as glucose mirror, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the basis of the health care of young people with alarming weight loss.
"The health questions from 1999 and 2006 revealed that in almost six years the proportion of pregnant boys increased by 77% and 47% of pregnant women. The prevalence was also dramatic," the IMSS Specialist stressed.
He explained that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of the other peoples.
He noted that a (e) Mexican (in) average of 65 per cent of Indian-Americans, 30 per cent of Europeans and 5 per cent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of fatty matter are inexhaustible to burn the excess of energy (calorie) taken to us, so that it will be included in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits of the survey participants were contained in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they showed a degree of overweight or fattyness.
It would even examine the presence of dark skin in the neck and in the internal arm (Akanthosis), which indicates the probability of metabolism and diabetes in the pre-existing stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the tests and recommend changes to the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for weight, fattyness and other chronic diseases: movement deficiencies, which mean a lack of movement every day, most of the time of the day before the TV and use transport means, instead of short walk.
The high intake of calories, i.e. an increased consumption of sweetened beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, broth, pizza, hamburger, etc.) together with high fat and egg intake and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Suspension from the UNAM preventer
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the University of Chemistry at the United Nations University of Mexico developed modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
It would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 holes if the rain time in the Zone Metropolitana del Valle de Mexico (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the University of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the release and maintenance of the shelter were appropriate, the number of holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his speech "Schools of Technical View", which he used to refer to chemistry during the International Year, he noted that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, developed modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which shows a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the street camp and to avoid the presence of shells.
He explained that Asphal - the hardest part of the soil oil - is a carbon link, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphals - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they provide the street area with its characteristic digital behaviour.
Digital behaviour of the asphalt means that it is held at a high temperature of about 180°C as a liquid, at 120°C it is very sensitive and is almost fixed at 50°C while it is used at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes," the chemical engineer said.
The researchers of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road cover consisting of six material boats containing the last three mirrors.
Between the upper layers is a mixture of asphal, which consists of small, solid stones built in Asphal and then solid stones.
Every single stone of this slab is built in Asphal.
When vehicles continue to move and power is created, this shield enables a good distribution of forces in the street area.
"If it were a modified asphal, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"On the sword of the sword," he said, "there will be a last sword, which is called the sword, which consists of twenty-six stones, i.e. sand, which was also built in Asphal.
As these shoes are in contact with the vehicle wheels, they need a greater mechanical force than the gearbox and they need to be driven.
The most powerful of the forces receive and distribute this road is also necessary to maintain an appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important to take into account factors, above all, the water," he said, "because it greatly affects the behaviour of the mixture.
When the ground melts, water pushes into the boat and turns back harder. This causes a rise in all the layers of the road deck and thus the presence of the strikers.
When a disaster occurs, he said, "the cover will be removed first, while the damage will only be affected. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programmes."
The member of the National de Investigados (National Research System Mexicoos) explained that the vehicle glass is another important reason for the presence of sludges. Therefore, the thickness of each side of the road must always be in relation to the vehicle glass and it must be ensured that this arrangement is maintained in order to prevent frequent slags.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still many research work to be expected, for example, on asphalt emulations that were already on the market in other countries, with which the shells were easy to repair and without applying high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th Missile.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty when he paid the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winning podium, to set up a silver crown and the band that she appeared as new Miss Colombia.
With the result of this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took up the crown and the garden, the department is already on 14 missiles and Melina is already on the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had kept the crown almost in their hands. Among the declared Misses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Maria Alvarez (1981), Rosa María Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romiro (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007).
The big question that many ask today is: What's wrong?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, which has shown in every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not only was she chosen to be the king of the police and Major Rostro Jolie from Vogue, who also received the beautiful daughters of Taliana Vargas and Natalie Navarro, and who took the crowns of Miss Navarro with her home.
The first factor that is crucial to the decision of the jury to appoint her to the first Miss is that she did not believe the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most, and why?" which she had been asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca urged the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I think very much of the literature, I think it's a kind of civilisation, finally I think that the book, which was the most important book for my childhood, 'The little prince', is a very deep book.
At present I read 'Schold and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I just read a book from Irene Niirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called 'Leidenschaften'.
An answer that stood on little opposition, first because of the term 'citizenize' and second, because she had not specifically explained how each of her so-called book had affected her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is a way, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'the little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred one who had attended all the events and had received all the prices in advance (Gastronomy competition Oster, public opinion over the best cut-off costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates exhausted, what the queen stressed, which was therefore unable to shine on the stage."
And this was noted in their first presentation on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in their two climbs at the Red Cross.
Despite her safety at both of them, she lacked the strength and courage that representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico had taken care of.
Ariel Osoriio, a journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was stolen to the miss "shows that the candidate, who won most of the prices during the competition, will not eventually become a king".
In addition, Valle went to close the press from the road - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which ultimately is the essential part of the national beauty competition.
It has already been reasoned that two days before the international jury, Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"The beauty alone is not enough for a group of Colombians. You have to look at the body and concentrate on the social feeling, because it has already worked with projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It will also be speculated that Valle, with her faults of the third and the fibrosis, which you noticed in the Magnificent area, has sinned. But this is disgusting because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the kings, Jorge Hernán Orozco, suggests that Melina didn't have the best body to give it better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the roof, which I honestly said was not to notice, pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos magazine is the view that the woman’s mistake from Valle del Cauca was the surgical intervention she had been subjected to.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how they should make them right.
Your body has never been their strong side, and this place had to pay."
Because of this price, which was the first time awarded by the National Beauty Law competition, after the event in the Bade's apparition, there was a gratuitous prediction that should be true in the night. It was exchanged that Raymondo Melina had given a troll price to prevent them from coming into the benefits of the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is present today, although not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that she offers the opportunity to represent at the heart of the Colombia national beauty competition in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter history as one of the kings who, despite her overwhelming appearance to Cartagena, had lost the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a Lophoscopist of CTI from Cali confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González had worked with a man from Puerto Tejada who had been involved in criminal investigation procedures for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to spend five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000, he settled over and after completing the required course, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to the joints, i.e. the hands and feet.
In the week of application against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night he flew into the hive from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the men who had led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be the one he should take with him the ten-finger printing sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was present, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least of the images he had seen in the mass media.
He didn't have a bar, he was like a farmer in the area, he didn't wear a glasses and he was very thin.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, tinte, a plant source and a cup lamp, Eliazar compares the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He saw it right: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On Spure Search
For a daktyloscop of Siján in Cali, the statement made by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González was very important at a press conference on the use of "Cano".
Many people don't know our work.
The datatyloscopy is an accurate science without error rate, which can be a key actor when solving a crime.
Lophoscopists identify not only bodies, they also support detections in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they were arrested, many of the perpetrators presented false statements or did not have any.
We take the fingerprints from them and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to pull a piece of wall out of a house at a dibstal, because the dib had stood directly at this place with his hand when he pulled out a fully covered safe with jewelry and money.
"We are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for taking fingerprints. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several drums," he recalled.
Thanks to fingerprints, killers can also be released or loaded.
Before long, a killer was found surrounded by snowflakes.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and actually agreed to a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is about the killer, he will be associated with the place where the penalty was committed.
A Dactyloscopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints would be taken with chemical or physical reactions from the object."
If they appear, a plant source or band will be used for adoption.
Then the expression will be sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or personal status.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," the CTI expert explained.
He meant, not everything is the way it would appear in the TV series SCI.
Like not all gold, what shines, it's not everything you pick up is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if a corresponding comparison is carried out.
The "mortem" demands the authorities out in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed themselves together in cells on the Zuccotti square.
A large part came to the room command and changed its location into a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked the New York authorities on this day of service when they again tried to attend the Manhattan square once they were in the morning and tried to occupy another place at Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators joined themselves before the Zuccotti Square, where they had a right order that allowed the "immortem" to enter the new cells at this site. However, another part of the movement to the space command continued to occupy a park in the city where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp on the spot, we will meet in another place and continue the fight with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Brey, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Brey pointed out that the response of the "immortals" to the room of her cell camper, which was directly organized by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent space of the place and allowing demonstrators to use the cells.
In addition, the "embryos" have a new park that connects the centrally located Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue all near the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could have owned the place for at least an hour, but then the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Brey was unable to give the exact number. He assured the news agency that he had seen several journalists with handshake.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have found themselves at this point, where religious leaders have also been appointed as symbols of their support of the members of the movement and of the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a country in private property) remains closed in the expectation of a fair hearing which is still open for this day of service and should be analysed in the legality of the room located in the morning.
Some of the demonstrators from the site took photos of this ruling order and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who were waiting for the place, which had "a few small meetings" to do, as Brey reported, who had shown that some police had shot demonstrators.
The right direction prohibits the authorities to remove members of Octupy Wall Street from the place and the use of "debts that have been adopted after the occupation and to prevent demonstrators from returning to the park with their cells and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that because of this right-wing arrangement, the opening of the place for public transport and demonstrators has been resumed. The demonstrators showed that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with cells and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the room of the Zuccotti Square, which was held in the morning, where almost 200 persons were arrested, and decided because the demonstrators "proceeded against the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to make room for the place because it "had turned into a place where people didn't come to demonstrators, but to break the law and in some cases to add damage to other people" because "some businesses would have received pressures" and the inhabitants were afraid "of their quality of life".
"The room in the morning was relaxed and shows that Bloomberg was interested in the protection of the financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of press".
The officers of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they had observed to organize "great actions" for Thursday, and that they were together with community organizations and trade unions, to think about the two months that the protesters have already lasted since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the young woman Maria in the TV wedding show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, they will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian lady Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", saved in "Baywatch", Kaninchen at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model are the young woman Maria in a Canadian night television broadcast.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladen Singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will be joined by a very special young woman Maria.
CTV today spread images from the TV program, in the Anderson - which also appeared to spread on the Internet a very busy porno, in which she, together with her former husband, the actor of "Mötley Crée", Tommy Lee, appeared as a young woman Maria with a doll in the pocket that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comer of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" mission by Charlie Sheen, as Jesus.
The CTV Christmas program is not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires by the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian "Hure" at a concert in New York.
Japan will be born after the earthquake
The BIP grows by 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still in the process of generation after the devastating earthquake that struck a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced was World War II.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to $300,000, a sword that seems to weaken despite the difficult economic situation.
After three quarters, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September were finally completed: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual quota.
The second quarter measured value - in Japan begins the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The refurbishment may be partly explained by the machine sales for the refurbishment of the soil and the following Tsunami areas.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the return by 0.9% for capital institutions recorded from January to March, the first return after six months of outstanding increases.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not solely based on Kenyan attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
The rise in Japan is particularly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, despite rising expenses for vehicles, travel and leisure.
The step increment of the adjustment
Tokyo has committed itself to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the "influence guarantees" of investors flying in front of the Eurozone debt crisis and the broken forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is as a gravestone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a lower currency, the products abroad are expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, brought back their weak business results from July to September on the note of the Yen.
While markets continue to plague peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains growing.
"I need to focus on the risks involved, for example, on the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of overcrowding in Thailand and the rapid assessment of the Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had provided clear indications of slowing economic development.
The indicator, which preceded the world economy’s turning points, pointed out that the brakes would be taken to the largest economic potential.
Because he paid for four decades to lose 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is at 100, after it has fallen by eight decades at 99.13 points.
Athenian is allowed to rise again in doubt
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to fall into the Labyrinth, which emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consens" of the new Greek transitional government is more than a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of political forces is slowed down by facts.
The new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days of its appointment could be too short for their implementation, the leaders of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new sponsorships and, if not, his request for new elections on the expected date, on 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken on the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open up a parliamentary debate, which will be reached with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax abuse are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's message does not raise doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The Conservative Leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IWF, the organization that needs the 8000 million people who need them urgently, and he made it clear that he would not want a declaration of commitment on the implementation of the savings measures.
However, the European Commission, which is still alarmed by the effects of the poker game with Papadreu Referenceum, has confirmed yesterday that it would not be necessary to respond to its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leader of the most important Greek parties "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The speaker of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika returned to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government, "what to pay for the sixth section" at an amount of EUR 8000 million "must be required," although there is no final date yet.
The Greek button is still for a long walk.
King Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The King stressed the "priority" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of microfinances around the world".
The King Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed itself as the second contributor to international cooperation for this instrument. Its "We know" refers to a " tool for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of confidence in man".
The Queen refused to join the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that "no doubt" meant that this kind of business would be "absolutely impossible" in order to achieve the annual proportions of the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with less than one dollar a day, thus under the "arming threshold".
Spain "continues to work" at the expansion of the profit network "to the end of the world, and this task takes full responsibility," noted King Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit that will last until Thursday will be extended, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the doctors and, in particular, for women" are guaranteed as key beneficiaries of this loan.
"We have recorded many successes" and "there are many challenges."
The summit on small credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for achieving "two fundamental objectives".
The King explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and ten million of these households would be exceeded the poverty limit.
The concept of Small Credits goes back to Spain and the rest of the world to the "Initiated Way Years ago" considered by King Sofia as a "Act of Justice and Recognition".
The father of this funding instrument described it as a "winning idealist who has written the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years as the queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the wage strategy.
In this experience, a year later, the first world summit in Washington and other meetings at the elephant coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. At the time of all, "we can observe a continuous further development", the queen, whose commitment to this project she announced yesterday, introduced the evaluation as "family headquarters" in Valladolid and as "prison of the poor".
Finally, the King Sofia ended her speech by encouraging the participants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Debt"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is a "ethical ban" for the whole democratic state.
In this regard, she stressed that it was a mistake to link the development aid to economic trees because it was a "long-term commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that the small-scale credit is a "lowest and stricter policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states now had to work "more and more" on solid criteria, and they should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall to the victim.
For Spain, small credit is one of the most important forms of development assistance.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, explained "the success", "marginized" people, "the always before closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the inhabitants of a city who opened "their doors, marked by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to select EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the convention of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig) was in love with Angela Merkel, Chancellor and president of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it was in the autumn, in particular in order to provide sufficient support to those who today and possibly Italy's government policy in terms of Greece.
The Presidency's proposal for a Presidency of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had taken the vote.
The several minutes of the ongoing state of ovation, which was first considered by Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schöuble, were no doubt open to the three European ministers of finance.
The main time of the Chancellor is - as is the request - the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a break in Europe".
This could be expressed through an amendment to the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, which could also be expressed by the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote".
This is, however, one of the proposals adopted by the Congress that clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäubble Pate.
Of course, it is very unlikely that the 47 will soon fall on this revolution: Great Britain is facing the issue, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is located.
In a overwhelming majority, delegates also rejected the proposal for a weighting of each country in the ECB's position according to the weight of the individual economies, which was apparently due to an increase in Germany's position.
As a result, the Chancellor, who looked at the climate within her party, has strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win their Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty that would immediately criticise Germany.
As long as the European application for the importance of the "German-French friendship" refers to a paragraph, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was in the middle of a bloody battle two hundred years ago.
In fact, one of the highest dwindling lower levels of the Napoleonic army.
What is the significance of the disease reports?
Following family assistance, UMP and the government are now responding to the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to look for a family assistance package and talk about it - ever repeated since 2007 - the subject of the fight against social and economic dependence from the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which aims to put the economy under a hard test, however, on the other hand, not less than one side of the right presidential campaign, the majority of the workers want to focus on job-care reports.
Firstly with budgetary objectives: the Government will monitor the introduction of a fourth career day in view of a health report for workers in the private sector.
In good German this means that a hard worker would lose the wage of four days without the consent of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A mavnacom, which, according to the newspaper "Les Echos" Zorn's complaint, would help bring in 280 million euros.
And those with another mavna took a more symbolic character: the state officials were to rent an unexplained career day in the event of illness (as long as it is for them, in contrast to the three career days in the private sector, no career period).
While these questions are in the discussion, the majority of them are also re-examined, which is now intended for the abuse of labour.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and in addition they will be rewarded when asked for it," Xavier cautioned on Sunday, November 13, before the transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this message on the reality of negative actions in the field of disease reports seem to be somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as of political offensives that have most frequently been carried out.
The French are no longer more common than people in other parts of Europe.
However, first we refer to the country-wide figures.
According to the CCAM, more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006.
As a result of the Economic Research and Documentation Institute for Health, the daily expenditure in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion 5% of the health expenditure.
This amount includes 46% of maternity leave, labour accidents and 54% of sickness leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, a study of the Alma Consulting Group was conducted on average only 14.5 days of illness.
An average of some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career plan website, showed that 75% of the 40 000 asked French workers not to take a single day of illness.
Another study conducted this time by the health insurance reveals that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
In comparison with their European neighbours, therefore, the French workers are no longer tending to work in a different direction.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French and state Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, global outflows (based on disease or otherwise) were oscillating between 10% and 11% from 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The amount of disease reports represents a significant decrease in the proportion of black work.
With regard to the company, only a weak sample will be achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 indicates that there are systematic controls on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and further training of engineers and engineers) of 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285.000 of the short-term disease reports were in 37.050 cases "unjusted or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of disease over 45 days, among 1,2 million, 11% were "unadjusted or unjust" cases, which had 132 000.
In general, this makes 169,000 "unjusted" cases of several million workers who have made a report of illness.
A figure that represents only a weak sample of those of black work, for example.
According to UMP coordinator Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euro tax losses per year, i.e. more than the total costs of daily payments, and therefore significantly more than the deficit in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to start its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos announced to Parliament that the fact that his Government had failed to fulfil this task was not sufficient for one hundred days since the Union.
"In order to continue the efforts to pursue an economic recovery, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme for budgetary adjustment," the Head of Government said in his first public speech at the beginning of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the time of the Euro-Egypt Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new Government, as the country's involvement within the Eurozone "in the game" is seen as it added.
Similarly, Mr Papademos planned to reduce the country's deficit "from 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after which it fell by 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights stem from the new sponsorship
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the already approved mammary measures concerning an attempt to relieve the debt crisis, but had predicted that his party would not be prepared for additional sparma adoption.
"We will not vote in favour of new adoptions," he said at the end of a parliamentary meeting of his Party's Party's New Democracy.
However, he had declared himself ready with the objectives of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as combating abuse, against any policy that would undermine economic growth.
Olli Rehn, an EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IWF and the EU from releasing the necessary loans over EUR 8 billion without providing written guarantees to all parties on their support for planned mammary measures, had replied that he would be sufficient to sign his word and not under pressure from Auvein.
Euthanasia and associated Freitod must be legislated, so an expert gremium
The Canadians live in a death-free manner, as a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health institutions and doctors worked together to prepare the best painkillers, as well as to deal with cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians can actually talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a taxable report by the Royal Society of Canada, where six experts were involved, which are linked to different fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This panel recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, and in the case of patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
The experts quoted a recent published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself at the 10th level, the study notes that "the medical death penalty in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to cut off the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, so the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada inform us.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of those in the hospital eventually die.
From the whole country, the rate of 86% deaths in the hospital is the highest in Quebec.
In the issue of euthanasia and accompanying Suizid, the authors of the report are faced with conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already passed, is not subject to any amendments to the law on Euthanasia and the accompanying Suizid.
But now there is no evidence that such criminalisation would lead to the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by people who are not competent or unaccompanied.
On the other hand, there are a lot of cases of such transfers just in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide have not been legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, reporter of the report, confirmed at a teleconferencing conference yesterday.
"Euthanasie is practiced in Canada where she is clearly illegal."
"Suizid is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Approved the Euthanasia
At present, we believe that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already opened up in favour of Euthanasia, since they are the opinion that it allowed people at the end of their life path to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the conduct of a legalization of euthanasia does not result in spreading the message that the life of older or disabled people is less valuable.
With regard to those who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, 41% of the respondents felt that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards maintenance or administration of the funds in patients, the report's authors appear to be less clear.
They also point out in their recommendation list that the penalty law should specify that the cancellation of the funds for which a legal ban has been imposed should not be considered criminal.
In addition, the expert community calls for experts of health to be held in the task of respecting a derogation from the means of life, and this must be feared without criminal persecution.
The panel stated that governments, health institutions and doctors cooperated with more painful treatment in order to prepare the best painkillers, and this is also true of cancer cases.
Finally, the Board calls on the Canadian institutions to take into account the resources already widely used to reduce or reduce life-threatening diseases already in their health care institutions, as they are less than the Euthanasia serves to reduce physical pain and they are involved in the same procedure.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the area of health law have already provided reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has called the attitude of reporting experts among others "extrem", since they do not set any limits for the Euthanasia practice in patients at the end phase.
"This opens up the opportunities for a situation in which everyone, who is a victim of life and is 18 years old, asks another person to be helpful to him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had looked at a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Dischamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to be responsible for the individual’s own responsibilities over all other values that are involved in the social activities of the society.
But now, he says, there are "guilt lines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also referred to "a strong resistance" against the conclusions of the report, which she titled as "Pro-Euthanasia-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is two-fold in particular the reports on the non-problem of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad on power
Damascus boasts a "complex"
Syria is more isolated
The Partisan Bashar al-Assads have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria Baschar al-Assads, which, however, has been opposed by Russia's support and a "computer" against the country has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the Syrian invasion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union violated its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring Syrian countries, had a position in favour of an act of President Assad.
King Abdullah II. By Jordan, that ambitious Arab Prime Minister, President Bashar al-Assad, had asked him to lower his office in Syria yesterday," which had already been killed by the fourteen civilists and members of the government.
"Bashhar put his country's interests in his heart, so he would fall apart, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, near Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Diplomatic Chief Ahmet Davutoglu had regretted that since the beginning of the year the Turkish regime has not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and can't satisfy this must go," he explained in an interview with Syria, the neighboring country, where Turkey takes a steady stand.
The United States, on the other hand, has confirmed the "consistencies against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" due to the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have been hit by a more severe tone in Syria," said Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government were killed in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria, so the Syrian human rights observatory OSDH announced.
Two other civilians were, according to this NGO, "Schools and heavy bomb attacks on Jobar" in the town of Homs.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Mullim was still the view that the country "taxed at the end of the crisis".
On the other hand, he reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which reflected his appreciation for a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not be followed", he added under the impression that "the conspiracy against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppeé also spoke in favour of sending UNO observers to protect civilians from repression of the regime to arrest him in his "Paranoia".
A planned reconvenance of the League is scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the plan on the rise of crisis on 2 November, in particular the disputed, expected withdrawal of the military forces from the fortified cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lawwow introduced the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrected" to prevent any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already mentioned Syria for the implementation of the crisis increase plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to prepare for sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future head of the Italian government, has asked the markets for a little more time to create his staff and implement a program that "supply" requires to restore the credibility of the Berlusconi government lost during the last few months.
The former EU Commissioner had concluded a deal with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and labour unions.
It was his task to appoint a cabinet in Parliament, which was made up of a relatively strong external technocratic.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, coordinator of one of the many parliamentary groups participating in the talks after he met with the presiding Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had hoped that Mario Monti would give Parliament a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The discussions will be held in the presentation of a list of complaints submitted by Mr Monti, which will reach a dozen ministers to the head of the state of Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that the strict nervousness of the bond and bond markets required their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", in order to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it was "sure that the markets would show themselves decent and understanding".
Its orders were confirmed by the Presidents at the beginning of the markets, but the uncertainty had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industry production in the euro area in September.
The Amplifier Prime Minister is going to establish an existing pillar of technology, although he stressed that he would also like to join the "political" group.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, as he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the assurance of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has been obliged to work in all earnestness for the purpose of making Italy "renewed protagonists" in Europe.
A speaker from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed in the light of the new government itself".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome's budget balance target will not be achieved in 2013 despite the savings plans that have been reached in recent months, has called for new hardware measures in particular.
Emma Marcagagglia, the head of the heads of Italy, who will meet on Monday, is also on the need for economic recovery," as a country which has no growth that cannot respect the definition figures."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epochen exchange" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "reliability challenge" and a "other Italy" as well as the guiding tools.
The grave stranger here sees the length of his steps.
President Napolitano would like to prevent the proposed elections, since Italy has now reached EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
Russian scientists are helping the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wijatschenslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-free explosives, thus confirming an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents issued by this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had announced its "responsible care" over the last week, with a possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of AIEA documents since ISIS, Danielenko, born in 1934, had been working in a Soviet military nuclear power plant in Cheljabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he should have left the centre to build a company in Kiev, which produces the "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he joined an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In her last report, the AIEA mentioned strong evidence that Iran's development "a nuclear explosive system" has been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who has not only been confined to this technology, but also as a Member of the Agency, has worked on its entire professional career on this technology immediately at the military core energy programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Delicts increased by 50%
The crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% since 2009, although other racist or religious motivated violence has been reported by the FBI statistics published on Monday in either case or have increased slightly during the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, thus increasing by 49%, although a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% return to the Jews, and a global increase of 14% to anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hassed motivated crimes" has increased to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, such as the FBI.
"After a fall in 2009, it is encouraging to see these crimes and crimes again," stressed Human Rights First.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communique.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of Hasscene crimes, should be considered as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible member of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to fight these obstacles," he added, assuming that this could be carried out by improving the police's attitude towards the "hassed crime".
The "hassdefence" appears in the U.S. federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent persons who are directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also involved criminal sexual membership.
Twitter transforms the platform and compares more and more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which allow the service to compare more and more with those of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another"Name enables you to learn more about the activities of other "Twitter", Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are being followed and your messages are followed.
This enables them to find out whether they allow their messages to be followed, whether they subscribe to new posts, or to promote certain messages.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August at a low percentage of users", the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner announced before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, with something like the esoteric anmotive Wordlaut (RT to refer to the feedback of another person). followfriday for recommending to follow up another user) thus opening up a wider audience with a more comparable approach to the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed with the help of certain "Tweets" via the Internet about this innovation.
"This is useless, exciting and very similar to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "Activity" will help me to follow certain elements of my Flux Twitters better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a Golden Rules of Budget in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the major Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria has decided to adopt a "Golden Budget Rule" to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top bonity (AAA).
It was the social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision from the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt was 74.6%, so much more than the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay does not fall short of AAA to AA+, we have to pay three billion euros a year," Michael Spindlelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Minister for Democracy argued.
Austria also made a request to the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had at that time called for the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and for a return to public interest in the Constitution or through the adoption of an equivalent law.
This is similar to the "German model" taken by the Austrian government, since Germany was the first European country to have adopted such a "regulatory" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (BIP) per year, and since 2017 the federal structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% GDP limit, although regional countries and communities should show comparable households.
The aim is to reduce the budget debt under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Starker Yen
Noda comes with a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again on the currency markets if the Yen were to continue to increase.
"If we are to establish an absolute volatility" in the exchange course of the Yen, we will also intervene as we have done the last time," explained M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again speeded up to the historical level, which the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo sold massive Yen against the dollar to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the Yen has been regularly raised, baptized by purchases of investors who see the Yen as "influential value" in these uncertain times of global economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 yen, the euro is below the symbolic lot of 105 yen in the vicinity of the level that had reached the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar reported on the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This fire fire of the Japanese Devise damages the exports of the Archipelago, as it reduces the costs of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value derived from Japanese companies from abroad as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and Tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (Northern) for its reconstruction," said Mr. Noda, who fears that this terror of the Yen could already kill the weak awakening in the chemistry.
The third economic power has grown in the third quarter of -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, for the first time this year, thanks to the rapid export gains and the consumption of the "exploded" households in the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister appreciates that the tenure of the Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
On the other hand, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, calling for all thought-instruments to be taken out of the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Director of the Institute, has been informed that BoJ has already introduced "appropriate gains" to allow him to expect no further money laundering on Wednesday.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the Nottenbank had increased its state-owned purchases of 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) coverage fees it had set up for various purchases of financial securities to transfer the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Cynthia fasts in height, bubbles turn back
The risk of closure of the debt crisis is constantly determining European figures.
Despite the adoption of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the Councils of the weak countries continue to grow steadily.
The sources that are still concerned about the stability of the euro area are also running on this Tuesday, 15 November, a little more in negative fields.
In Paris, the CAC lost by 10 hours 1.4% and fell at 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"In view of the new efforts towards the return of state loans in the Eurozone in difficulty, the world's stock markets continue to deliver some of their short-term gains.
"The capitalists are nervous and only aware of the risk of extinction," says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The difficulties in Tokyo, which, on the new part of the market participants, led to the capacity of Europe to continue the debt crisis, had closed by 0.7%.
"Japan has directed its eyes to Europe as well as to the rest of the world, and trade moves to a limited variation corridor, while the perpetrators have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This recurrence of concern over the future of the euro area damages the unit currency that continues its base on the service day.
The euro has been moving to its lowest level for a few months.
By 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1,3570, so it amounted to 0.4%.
According to the complainants, after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the convention on Monday, had filed an application, which, in particular, provides for the possibility of leaving the European Union without leaving it at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish Councils are far below 6%.
Italy and Spain continue to be at a very impressive level.
This Sunday morning, the Italian commitments reached 6.85%, which the Spanish title reached 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to bring fears to the workers.
The future Italian Head of Government Mario Monti requested more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the Eurozone summit would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market view, since the elections take place on Sunday in the country.
The zinsker ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year obligations has achieved a new, historical height.
Expected growth figures in the euro area
In the third quarter, France recorded an economic growth by budget consumption of 0.4% in the third quarter, so less than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of the INSE had revised the basis of the figures of the second quarter, with a minimum of 0.1% of gross domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it's the fourth quarter, which most economic experts are concerned.
Germany had to record an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate of the entire euro area will be expected at 11 hours, warning the EU Commission of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
The facts should be seen on documents
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is wise to take an election meeting to allow for reflection on this subject and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bring fruit if it is accompanied by the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution is beginning to double the demand for electricity by the year 2050, there is no need to forget a huge proportion of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to soften the linkage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce constant electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, one of the issues that have been raised from the ecological debate, to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to abandon core power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which underpins its decision of necessity to find a substitute source of replacement, nor in Switzerland, which is only intended to build core powers of the last generation.
The Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, has decided to join their park by re-entering the Three Mile Island work after the fall.
Even if it is based on renewable energy sources, the German model is sometimes used as a template, however, the reality of the discourse is opposed.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of a distribution of the electricity price, a stronger energy dependence on imports, in particular Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark has an opportunity to reflect.
Denmark is one of the most powerful users of coal and gas, on the one hand, and its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French budgets.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role of competitiveness and a stable base of industry on national soil, French companies have benefited from the most valuable electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in nuclear power would result in a strong increase in energy prices, which would allow the original statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to be ignored.
Asked whether it is a price that the vast majority of the French are willing to pay as little as they can afford to resist the principle of this source of energy.
At the same time, we believe that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 440 000 induced jobs.
Because of its strong export characteristics, it brings a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises into the international markets and makes them the creation of countless jobs.
Should France decide to increase from core power, a large part of this SMEs would fall to the victim, and the annual 6 billion euros on investment gas and nuclear energy exports would be more and more aggregated.
What electricity would be responsible for operating an EPR designed for six hundred years if the decline of its producers is planned?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must realize that there is no one like a devil work that is a miracle tool for the production of electricity.
The solutions developed by the Areva company, CO2 arms for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementaryity of energy sources.
The highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for core power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompressed and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Those working groups who have made themselves a name because of their professionality are just to be deprived of the security proposal.
Within 50 years, the core industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, and even in Three Mile Island, has been included under normal operating conditions; so he fell in love with no consequences for man and the environment.
In Tschernobyl the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as innocent, human failure.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the disaster of two natural disasters has never been caused by a mass mass that has caused more than ten thousand deaths.
The core industry will also remove its teachings from this incident, as it had done after the two preceding ones.
As a result of this procedure, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of French and German nuclear power plants and manufacturers, the EPR is a project that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a welcome gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to travel on a free train to the leadership position in the independent nuclear power development.
It is impossible and legitimate to look for the best energy source for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow for a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a number of policies, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Landes of Human Rights", as France itself claimed.
Before long, the government's tax on foreign students was charged with the weekly visits by the Minister of the Interior (see libération of 23 May) that France "does not need talent, maurer or basements from abroad".
But this policy was only rarely analysed from the economic perspective.
On this subject, there is a broad consensus between rights and links.
On the right-hand side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, which in 1976 stated that "950,000 unemployed, including 2 million immigrants, should not present a problem for a country," by the left-hand side of Michel Rocard, who had represented 1990, France "would not be able to overcome the world's entire poverty".
The only difference is in the degree of gravity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by the order of Polish Klempner was shared by both right and left in 2005.
The immigrants were taken from both camps as a burden to the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of gravity that you want to stand against immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to Banalities, which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "Migrating Problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically cost-effective.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that combines the latest knowledge on immigration (Exclusive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broader consensus among the specialists about the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of migration.
Restricting immigration would increase growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears with regard to the influence of migrants are based on the assumption that they encourage local labour forces, in particular the less qualified ones, to replace by pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are actually significantly more complementary than domestic wage workers, since they are highly skilled in sectors that are technically unloaded.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers are less qualified than immigrants are working in dynamic sectors where training is not available to the worker supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetics, this complementarity also has a positive effect on pensions and the situation in the labour market between natives and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flows has led to a slow, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is accessible (higher proportion of immigrants under American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also contributing net to social systems in the European countries within a range of around 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person moving abroad from Germany to Germany under the age of 30 will make a net contribution of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget in the medium term over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to repeat the missing cuts "with the teeth".
However, these affected teeth, which should be cut off by immigrants, were precisely the opposite effect.
Europe has found democracy, now it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should bear in mind who, after its discovery in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had been able to overcome the tragedy of the first world war, the Totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Frances in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Upper Greece.
Some believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, and in the right way and in the right way, to see democracy in every instance over their enemies.
Since Napoleon's "the little one", it has been a sign of spirituality.
The general right of election, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not enough for this and can also be good for the "independence instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed at the time.
No, democracy requires more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of violence, education, clarification, economic and social spirit, legal speech.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also a very and rather political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the change in the attitude of the Greek true-Falsch referendum had been twofold: once the necessity of a strong return to politics, on the other hand also those who feel disappointed by their inability to do so.
This ambivalentity should be considered as excessive.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have failed today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to make a success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to the needs and traffic lines.
A free home for the European alone, or a stream of connected eyes in the ears of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizens of the state!
No, we want a hacker, but a collective task, in full law, clear and constant, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we know no more where to end the census - since there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which reflects the dictatorship of the market and the rating agencies, which is under its control and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is demobilized at an international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - in this case it is all Europe that is losing its sovereignty, and that is why each of the nations belonging to it.
The urgency is that the peoples' unity should be given back to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is common for Europeans to reduce their debt, free themselves from the markets, and to start a future through investments.
The rise from the crisis has taken decisions at European level on the condition that we cannot be left without the total democratic legitimacy without bringing us into disappointment.
Following this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today needs to take the lead in the European economy.
I understand.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it presupposes citizens - it would be a new shock and a further suffocation.
We need to take a new step towards European integration.
To allow the Republic to come out in France, the fact that the Republicans were "creating".
The revolution of interests alone could not afford enough here.
This complaint remains valid.
We need to build a better integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically seen democratic Europe, a genuine European people's unity.
We need Europe to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are generally available
The World Fair for Chip Maps opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of micro-process Sorchips (EC cards, SIM cards) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The next segment is the contact-free technology that allows payments in public transport or comparison of purchases by simply holding the card on a reading device.
In contrast to the 320 million sold last year, 460 million wireless chips should be sold worldwide this year!
Your market share should continue in 2012 (580 million units expected) and more than 10% of the global chips market (6,925 million cards).
Europe will gain access to land after a long time of the Asian Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept this.
In France, the beginnings have been reported more: only 400,000 free visas have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets are making a fuss.
Carrefour has thus issued 2.5 million unconnected Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to go at higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to disbanding their customers in future systematic banking cards which are connected with a free chip," says Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Bank test payment per phone
This, however, is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
A resulting lower percentage of devices is equipped with the necessary NFC technology (NFC) to carry out these transactions.
"They've been betrayed."
"But at least next year they should experience real progress."
"We estimate in 2012 the sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks have an initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows for free payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Generale had also said yesterday to prepare for the introduction of a offer that would enable their customers to pay free of charge by telephone.
Terrorist front is understood to be from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram section.
The already suspected relations between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian section Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Prime Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria has now "encouraged" about it.
"The way in which both organizations proceed and the relations of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The findings on the conduct of two francs in the Niger last January have encouraged border crossings for days.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were shot in a restaurant in Niamey, should have been killed on the following day as many of their drivers were killed by an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to find several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the drummers.
Terrorist Church
The analysis of the telephone calls conducted leads to several speakers who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two speakers: a number leads to a Nigerian man who has been in Maiduguri for a long time, a city in northern Nigeria, who has stood by Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is closer to Akqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, however, before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's possible."
"I have known for years that the sector is involved in financial and intellectual support from Auvene and that it is increasingly active," laments Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "supporting services" have become more and more timely in their course, as well as the talks and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now refer to the drawing of suicide victims and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been pressureing Abuja to start at Washington to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, considered the grouping to be a community of illuminators for a long time, which should not be given special attention.
Faster Success
In 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school, and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a shame" - follows the creation of an Islamic empress in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the association has achieved rapid success.
She politicalizes and demands strict observance of the Scharia, while her party activists are using themselves in the fight against the ungodly central government.
At first, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in the audience.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram showed their strong attacks against the Commission particularly active.
However, the reaction of Abuja is usually neutralized.
The army surrounds the city, counting 800 deaths.
The prisoner Mohammed Yusuf was put to death in prison.
As a result, the sections are very radical and leave their peaks in the north.
Last Christmas she met an ant in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, thus another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram will be assigned the responsibility of a suicide victim, who will qualify in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations's local seat will be the leading international target line.
The formation of a terrorist school in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since been encouraged by all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé gave a speech with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria in front of Boko Harem and was ready to show "notice all".
The World due to the presidential candidates of the Republic
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they revaliate in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and Israel's assistance.
Can a crisis-depressed America make a complex world easy to say not to say: lead delicate ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mit Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their opponents will be able to repeat their statements and statements regarding foreign policy, traditional republican emphasis.
In China, Iran, and Israel's aid - often in no way underestimated - Slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the Grand Old Party at the top of the course, Romany urged the Chinese to sit before the WTO and they were the leading theme of the "Monetary manipulation" in an America that was driven by the confusion of all industry to Asia on the top.
It was stupid to run if this would imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former messenger in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have an excellent vision of foreign policy, has cut the air almost as far as his emotions are concerned.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange with Beijing (also the current standing of Obama).
But Huntsman won't hear because he's stuck in the depth of his opinion questions.
Reagan's Example
Romney had also supported military attacks against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to be lifted.
"If I were to choose, I'd go to Iran's content," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bombs."
Moreover, he has promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance and accused Obama of remaining a partner against obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the highest-ranked candidate, is, on the other hand, taking a considerable knowledge of the action.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat to be countered by Beijing's attempt to develop a nuclear power - and seemed to be above the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Technical Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military attacks on Iran, is on the other hand ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The withdrawal of Obama 2009 against mutant terrorists was also prompted by Cain, Perry, and Michele Bachmann's application.
John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, is far from an extrapolitical weight.
Unlike the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and nevertheless won the cold war.
They called to mind that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water to his wine, what the subject of anti-terror was about.
They need the right to follow his so-called bilingual conversation with Iran, the previous withdrawal of his "young" from Iraq, his incompatibility in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
This attack, however, is not quite such an insult.
The population also appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, who has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, they have faced military intervention leading to relief.
And Obama is surprised to see how well he argues that America needs to be economically restored in order to develop its leadership position in a new life.
North Stream, new tower to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs along the shore of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, was put into operation.
It is expected to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas station Gasprom wanted this event to take place with glaz and Gloria.
Over 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have spent their last day at the Ossetian Coast under Orchester Control and at the Feinschmeckerbuffet of the introduction of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea mirror.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have figuratively brought the taxes of the Ventil, which the Russian gas is transporting into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27,5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year are to be delivered to Western Europe through the first railway route of 1.224 km.
A second road guide allowing a total delivery of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And it is already possible to link the possibility of building a third direction on the same track.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this huge construction works is a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, namely, to avoid any transit journey by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the way to the country.
For this reason, these two countries lose some of their power: it is now harder for them to exercise pressure on Russia by trying to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest in the debate, was not back to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue of political vision is extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a greater supply security through the promotion of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of strengthening European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europe.
In almost five years Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have strong gas consumption and to reduce their gas prices.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arterial that connects us organically and in a way," confirmed François Fillon in the introduction of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the grave gas contracts are also important from the political and economic sides.
All of this explains the wide range of gasprom managers represented in Lubmin with regard to gas management.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The water management consists of steel with concrete assembly to protect them from ship-sankers.
It runs on the seabed, about 200 m deep.
In its construction, mining fields dating from the Second World War had to be removed.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed in advance," said Jens Müller, speaker of the company Nord Stream.
In addition, reinforced maws had to be taken to protect Fauna and Flora.
The guide is a long wire of metal, heavy as 242 eiffel drums, which is broken over the whole length of nothing: either by valves or waiting stations.
A control platform was planned in front of Sweden's coast, but the project managers took the initiative, since the Swedishs were less inclined to see a Russian state company in a permanent manner and in a way that their coastal heights are on the ground.
"In the case of a horse we close the gas tank in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the case of a lake, the gas found in the gas pipeline is therefore in the air.
However, this case is considered to be less likely by the designers, since the Swiss bond was valued as a legacy per 100,000 years.
The State oversight of the gas pipeline is ensured both by a underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a ship, and by a device that is circled within the gas pipeline.
It owns the form of a cigarette, with a meter diameter, is inserted into the inside of the wheel drive and moved on through gas pressure.
After three full days of movement by driving at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal when it arrives.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for five years without even being subject to the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the east point.
Five companies have joined their forces in carrying out these projects.
However, management remains in the hands of gasprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF (i.e. 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas and the French company group GDF Suez (i.e. 9%).
These five companies have formed a company called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has her seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is especially valuable.
Gazprom thus prevented the entire capacity of its gas transport company, and in the longer term Zwanzig-year contract.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of how gross the real transport gas is," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was guaranteed to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both railways.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are obliged to re-introduce their exhibits, since Gazaprom alone poses the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline lies at a sandy, cabled coastal beach at Lubmin from the east of the lake.
The 4.5 meters high ventilators form the gas-strips.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other numbers of the gas involved before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday this terminal will be delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand note book.
From an Italian company about five years ago, Moleskine now wanted to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, at Kerzenschein with writing hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, legal connection, its rubber band, the iron-coloured pages, as it grows over time.
However, the Moleskine Notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, whose seat is in Milan, decided to bring a distinguished design book to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's professional consultant, is responsible for the introduction of the new product.
The note book was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which is called a tree wallack, which is used for example with respect to polyester banks.
This type of notebook was asked by writers and travelers very much.
"Moleskine has relived an old and almost forgotten object that has been regarded as an icon of avantgardist artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for fashion fashion.
Success takes place.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established by 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first year, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantombilide of the buyers, as the notice book encourages business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-ended customers.
The small Italian company, which had numbered 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in books, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres, and understands its identity.
"We are followed by the time spirit and its new writing needs, which, despite the emergence of the e-mail," Maria Sebregondi explained.
This cultural attraction is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: the brand recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg) " in the architects and artists displayed their own notebooks.
In August, the company also brought into the market a link with Leoparden's model of film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and understood how to diversify his products: bags, terminal calendar, fillings, computers... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, which is now purchased by syntegra Capital, thereby opening up a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does unemployment remain so high at the level of job-intensive workers?
About 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite an ambitious public policy introduced in 2005, unemployment rates in disabled persons are always as high as average: 19% versus 9% of total unemployment.
Unsatisfied?
"No, that's how Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, stresses the "Work Week for Opportunity."
"The progress achieved within fifty years is significant."
"The unemployment rate was not doubled at the time, but three times as high."
"There's still a lot to do."
However, it has to be said that there are still many obstacles to the employment of disabled people before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no appetite and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education conclusions.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in the disabled compared to 38% in the overall.
In short, there are so many criteria which require a renewed increase in employment and which create the "cores of the problem", so Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, of a 1992-founded association that helps companies.
So much for the professional brakes.
The unexplained language, the spiritual attitudes that are sure of itself, remains, but slowly continue to develop.
A study conducted in April by the IMS entrepreneurs for La Cité magazine was conducted by a study carried out by the asked managers with "a weak level of knowledge about opponents", which "represented" is "from people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual minorities".
As a result, the private companies, with more than 20 employees, have a long way ahead of themselves to achieve the employment target of 6% of employees who have been arrested, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for doing so to include contributions from companies that violated this law.
The evidence: the number of "paying fees" operations has also decreased as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 and has decreased from 59 000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which foresees increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the company, declared Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also brings real knowledge, especially in the large corporate groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the jobs are employed, between 20 and 49 employees who were arrested, with 100 to 199 employees, 82%.
Hazard: "What for happiness"
Already before they had the "Blue Servicemen (20:45) on the stars, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not earned their pleasure, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there has been a secret understanding between them, but the picture speaks symbolic bonds.
On page on the tour podium of the city de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to close peace well.
Five months after the warm hospitality of his opponent against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had not taken anything as a compliment to his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgium."
"I'd like to look forward," the burning liller assured him.
What the contrast between his exhibition in Club and National Self is "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Little I've spent the whole year what's not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Dennis, led by a free hand against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "to shine".
However, do not leave the note of "satisfaction".
From the age of 7 years, the French National Mission fires him, leading his successful careers between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This makes it difficult to strengthen the "uncertain" character of this encounter.
Soviel in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Johann (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he argues.
"We just walked along the road."
"If they can play it means grave happiness!"
The doctor read on his side with kindness "Stolz".
"The Stolz, a Galamach."
"Stolz" also around - in his property as "neighbor" - to confirm that France has again become a man at a very high level" and that is less than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has read damn good work," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European empire, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the blues (the French National Aid) ... and Brazil's direction in 2014.
"We little Belgians come to the grave out," he insisted.
"We are planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"They'll notice this in the previous games." The game against France is about to go down.
Portugal very likely
The Portuguese delegation of Paul Bento sees with great optimism the return against Bosnia (22:00) this day of service in Lisbon.
In the game, both men had failed the facts.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy man and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national leader, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Union 2012.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and a opponent to be served, and that's Bosnia.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the Hall of Zenica it seems obvious that the walls have not fallen yet.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, but the man was not able to stress the important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, however, which results in a certain risk, because we have not achieved a surplus."
However, at home, in their bright-fashioned city de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced of this, before a publication, which should also have been on the game, even if the party was announced naturally as "very quick", the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very close match, but they are absolutely convinced that they can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We have continued to have a 50% chance at the European Union 2012", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
On Friday in Bosnia, the Portuguese are forced to reach and win a tower.
An exception may already be enough for the Bosnians who also need a tower.
"This is a good result, however, which results in a certain risk, as we have not achieved a surplus," Bento laments.
"We are going to face a man who has high technical qualities and has many individual qualities," he added.
As had been in Zenica, the Portuguese had already started to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnian to "do not allow time for meditation."
A good idea, under the condition that it will be implemented this time.
