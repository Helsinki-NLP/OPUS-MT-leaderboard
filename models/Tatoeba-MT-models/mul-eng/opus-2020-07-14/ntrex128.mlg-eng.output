The members of the Welsh parliament were concerned that 'just like an added movie club'
Some members of the parliament were reminded when they heard a symphony talk that their call would be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament of Welsh).
This is the result of an attempt to change the name of the Parliament of Welsh.
They are worried that all members of the parliament from all political colors will stand up to people’s admiration.
A member of a Labour Party's parliament said his group was worried because it was "to fight Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means stupid.
Members of the Plaid Party also said that all members were "not happy" and offered other suggestions.
A traditional Welsh Nenetist said his group has an "open mind" about the change, but he says it's very close to giving MWP and Muppet.
In this event, the letter "w" in the Welsh language is similar to the letter "u" in English in Yorkshire.
The Parliamentary Committee, which introduces legislation to include changes to the name, said: "It is clear that only members of the parliament will be responsible for the last words on which the members of the parliament will be called."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave President Welsh authority to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the question of citizens' views on the proposals, and it was found that many support to call the Parliamentary Parliament of Welsh.
With regard to the name of members of the parliament, Parliamentary Wellsh or WMP has been ignored by the Committee, but the MWP is the most supportive option when citizens are asked about their views.
The members of the parliament seem to have other suggestions, but the president's head, Elin Jones, may be concerned about the fact that the bill on change in a few weeks should be submitted.
Some changes in the way the ministry works, such as the rules on the removal of members of the parliament at its place and the committee's system, were also discussed in the Reform Act.
When members of parliament argue about this bill, they can ask for a final vote on their name.
Elections in Macedonia are under pressure during a public survey on the change in the country's name
On Monday, voters will choose whether their country's name will be "North Republic of Macedonia".
The ten-year transition to neighboring Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, is part of a public survey.
The officials in Athens have long confirmed that the name of their neighbors in the north is being violated, and they have consistently ignored the last request to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's President, Andrimatoa Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the public's request to change the name, said that he would think it was no less than that.
However, public opinion supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is only a change from entering the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Palace was closed when the congregations in Harlem were at war
"As for history, the older people who talked to me said that all the roads were filled with drinking houses and congregations," says Atoa Adams.
"Now, it's all gone."
I can only say that it caused the drinking house to disappear.
"People's communication has changed a lot" at the time, he says.
"It's time to make the drinking house a temporary rest room."
For the congregation again, he is concerned that the money paid by the church authorities will not last as long as they are selling them, "as soon as possible, they will return to their beginnings."
The local congregation, he says, may be replaced by a room to be built, and this kind of people will not be concerned about the remaining holy places around them.
"Most of the people are going to buy shelters in these buildings," he said, "so it's likely that these ordinary congregations will be late because it's unlikely that most of the people who live in them will be able to enter. "
These two congregations were formed in white, when Harlem – the great city in 1870 was not yet a black town, and became St. Martin ten years later.
In 1930 the white Methodist congregation first formed was removed.
At that time, a black believers' organization that had recently collapsed took the house for their own.
Rev. John Howard Johnson led the black congregation that took St. Martin, the guard led the residents who would not be sent to the passengers on 125th Street, a very busy road in Harlem, because they refused to hire black workers or to spread blacks.
The house was very beautiful in 1939, but when Mopera Johnson's hostages were able to redesign it, they took many cows.
Rev. David Johnson, Mopera Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin, was very proud to call it "the little flower."
But it was the name given by the specialist who led the crowd in July: "Cultural heritage" and "unresponsible historical events."
It was also noted by the specialist, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, that this was the first of the black world's blackman's notes, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest blacks in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Atoa Merriweather said that St. Martin no longer wanted to replace him.
In a few months, the events in St. Martin were a little tense because of the competition between housekeepers and the construction industry, some of which were held by church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council wrote to the diocese – the office of the head of the church, including the councils – in July said that the diocese was concerned whether the council “required to move the church’s debt” council, but the council did not enter into the church’s agreement with the owners and the construction company of the diocese.
Some prisoners complained about the lack of attention from the diocese.
The 13-year-old girl who did anarchy in California
On Saturday, a 13-year-old child in California was affected by the effects of an abortion on the day of the anniversary of an abortion, the authorities said.
The accident occurred at 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel's story of the KSWB-TV in San Diego, they had been busy for half an hour on the morning hearing of the girl who called for a break, and several of them had lost a chance to approach him and drag him out of the water.
I thought he was so happy that he got an abortion, Hammel said, but then he realized that he was calling it "I'm crazy!"
I'm buried!'
He was completely out of his mouth," Hammel points out when he came near the girl.
"I cried very hard to get out of all the water quickly: 'There's a nest in the water!' Hammel says.
The child was sent to San Diego's Children's Hospital by a plane that saved his life.
It is not clear what kind of dog he was hiding.
The Capt said during the interview with the journalist. Larry Giles said about the period of life that there was a ghost seen by people traveling to the area a few weeks ago, but it is known that it is not the kind of ghost that keeps people alive.
The upper part of the victim's body is very painful as it says of Atoa Giles.
The authorities have shut down the seabed for 48 hours until Pointo Beach in Casablad and still Swami's in Ecinitas for the investigation and protection of human lives.
More than 135 say the species found in this area is Ato Giles, but most of them are not considered to be people.
Sansbury's project is playing in the UK's fashion market
Sansbury's has come to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and uses the same space as a large market and a special-speech structure.
In an effort to find a place in the U.S. steel market of 2.8 billion Livres, which does not increase as the retail market gets more and more expensive, the more widespread markets will be made in 11 magazines across the country, and will be sent to other magazines if they seem to be successful.
In the time that large fuel is needed for the use of TV stations, the most recent use of money in the form of electronics and electronics is now available.
Saninsbury's said it would increase the size of its natural environment, which will last up to 3,000, and find a sign such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The long-term types of assets such as L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees will also receive more extensive space and bring special characteristics to the same ones as those seen in the magazine as Boots.
This great magazine also re-enacts the forms of cultural property in the bottle to give special attention to those who do not have the fruits of it – according to a growing demand from young players.
In addition, French seafarers will also be involved in the special marketing appointment in the Saninsbury magazine, so the first one opened in Croydon, south of London, and the second will be opened at the end of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
So as the number of people who choose to spend the Internet and buy less food in each city is increasing, major stores have to try hard to attract people to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, General Tale of Saninsbury's, their sales will continue to be similar to large stores according to the efforts of large stores against such customers as Aldi and Lidl by more services and food products.
Sainsbury's sale of Argos has already introduced many magazines, and Habits has introduced many of them since he bought the two magazines two years ago, saying that the sales of the daily goods increased significantly and the market value of the magazines they bought increased.
This large magazine's earlier efforts to give new life to the area of the fashion and the drug trade in it have been improved.
In the early 2000s, Sanisbury's tried to spend money with Boots, but the company was destroyed by the disparity of sharing money from the store owner in his large stores.
But this new plan was born three years ago when Sanisbury's 125 million Libres bought the Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, its 281 pharmaceutical network.
He stated that Lloyds would be responsible for this format, thus helping a wider range of products for respect for such items as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four different stores.
In particular, Paul Mills-Hicks, the sales director of Sanisbury's, said: "We have completely changed the appearance and experience of our cultural heritage so that we can improve the world of our customers.
We also used his cash to get special training employees, who are always ready to offer.
All of us have a huge impact on everyone's needs and because of the quiet and most likely public place, we have become a place that is impossible for natural beauty, and we are changing the pattern of ancient art."
Peter Jones was 'strong' when Holly Willoughby left the 11 million Libres deal.
Peter Jones, the most famous actor in Dragons Den, was deeply impressed by the fact that Holly Willoughby, a television broadcaster, rejected the 11 million Livers agreement in his life-threatening company because he turned his attention to his new relationship with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Troly character of a rapist and cojacist.
People said that the sale of the two pieces was similar to Goop's, which Gwyneth Paltrow's made.
In Instagram, this morning program, which is now 37 years old, says that he has broken the deal.
Peter Jones, the most famous player in Dragons Den, was deeply disappointed by Holly Willoughby’s recent release of the life-threatening company – he turned his attention to the new agreement he had made with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was said to be a "hard hit" when he agreed to the girl on the most expensive television show during a meeting held at the headquarters of the major company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, with the result of the new agreements – reaching 1.5 billion Livres – he no longer has time to rely on the identity of the three-star and domestic cooks.
People compared the trade to Goop's Goop with Gwyneth Paltrow and it was thought that Willoughby's size would increase by 11 million libres.
In a private plane, Jones left Great Britain to save one of his escape homes, Willoughby, who is now 37 years old, told Instagram that he would be separated from Truly.
One source says: "Truly first is the first set number for Holly.
This is exactly what his far-reaching future will be, and he will be safe for the next ten years.
Everyone is ashamed when they hear their decision to leave.
Everyone didn't believe when they heard the events on Tuesday, as the date was almost over.
There's a full magazine ready to sell at Marlow's headquarters."
According to experts, this morning program, which is part of the most expensive star in Great Britain, may cause millions of deaths for the company, and may reduce the start date.
They may also end up being their friends for a long time.
Jones and Tara Capp were close friends with Willoughby, who had been born three years ago, and his wife, Dan Baldwin.
Capp and Willoughby built the Truly company together in 2016, and in March Jones, 52 years old, came to take the place of Tale.
Both of them are running hard and Jones has 40 percent money in Baldwin's company.
Willoughby will find the location of the M&S character base again and will replace Ant McPartlin with the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV.
A news source near Jones last night said, "We can't talk about his business."
Strong words 'then we fell in love'
He made his journalist a joke because he made a possible comment that people would not "see the first place" and because he had hope of North Korea's president.
Why was President Trump so angry?
Trump’s response says and has been like the sound of the "new provider".
"I never said that."
Kim wants to hold a second meeting, when Atoa Trump said that the first meeting they met in Singapore last June was a major step towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, the debate on the production of nuclear weapons continues to be slow.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore last June, North Korea's highest diplomat, Atoa Ri Yong Ho, attended the United Nations Conference on Saturday, announced that North Korea had not yet seen the "compliant steps" in its first arms production processes.
He even says more about the punishment that is intended to force us to be stronger.
There is more hope than how Trump spoke in his speech during the campaign.
"We have a great deal of cooperation with North Korea," he says.
"We have already gone to war in North Korea.
Nearly a million people have lost their lives.
But now we have a good relationship with them."
They benefited by their efforts to improve Kim's relationship – stopped the fusée attempt, escaped the hostages, and set off the American soldiers ’ flag.
And she strongly protected the unusual view she showed when talking about her relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like the President, but let's see 200 people standing here, as you see 10,000 people outside the dining room that I've been running around," Trump said, and he brought the people in front of him.
An island in Indonesia is affected by tsunamis and earthquakes, hundreds of thousands of people die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations from abroad received a message that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's people were injured, there was no natural disaster report issued, but it was necessary to provide international assistance.
"They often regret that they said clearly that they did not ask for international aid, but we were worried," Rtoa Summung says.
Although the Save the Children are already preparing a team to move to Palu, foreign workers are not yet known or able to work in the area.
According to Atoa Sutopo, director of the Natural Disaster Bureau, the Indonesian authorities are still looking at the situation in Palu in order to find out if permission is given to assist in providing assistance to international offices.
If Indonesia is constantly experiencing earthquakes, the country's inability to cope with the anger of nature is likely to pose a real threat.
It is true that there is a shelter if there are tsunamis in Aceh, but it is not possible for the city to create other lakes.
It may be part of an increase in the number of deaths in Palu, although there has already been a warning issued.
Even when there is no problem at all, it is difficult to travel through many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters are just too difficult to deal with.
A hospital ship headed to Lombok to take care of the victims of the earthquake who moved to Palu, but it could be at least three days to the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo was focusing on improving the already-run system in Indonesia during his campaign for elections, and he added money for roads and roads.
The Joko's regime is a lot worse than the lack of financial assistance, especially in the coming year.
There is still a problem waiting for Joko to fight against different beliefs in Indonesia, as there are many Muslims who live their faith in a more traditional way.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives or fled because of the struggle of Christians and Muslims across the street, using a cross-sectional device, as well as other military equipment.
Look: Daniel Sturridge was killed by Liverpool's player, the very far away from Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's escape from the Premier League on Saturday because of an 89-minute shooting in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an offer from Xerdan Shaqiri when she was 27 meters away from Chelsea's castle, which led to 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left, which he just went hard to save the farthest tree.
The ball rose high, saved its right arm from the trap.
But then the ball came out on the top of Kepa Arizabalaga, which was lifted up and put in the bag.
"I was just trying to save that place where, to get the ball, the players like Shaq always put a ball in the front as soon as possible, which is why I tried to create a long time for myself," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I grabbed the ball first, and then I didn't really think I'd come by."
Chelsea led 1-0 to the relief because the Belza Eden Hazard star died in 25 minutes.
At that time the Blues attacker returned the ball offered by Matthew Kovacic, and then he suddenly fell near the center of the camp and stood close to Liverpool's allies.
Kovacic offered a ball in the middle of the camp and soon fled.
Then the ball ran away from several players and led Hazard to approach the tree.
Hazard's train was unafraid and he came to push the top of the tree, so he took the ball away from Alison Becker, Liverpool's hideout guard.
Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday at the San Paolo camp in Naples, Italy, during a group war in the Campions League.
On Wednesday, then, Chelsea will meet with Videoton in London, in UEFA Europe League.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia is 832
The number of people who lost their lives as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia is 832, says the Natural Disaster Bureau on Monday.
Many people are said to have not escaped under the earthquake’s 7.5 earthquake on the map, which caused up to 6 meters of seaships, says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, editor of the press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is surrounded by mud and wood from destroyed houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man who killed a woman in a robbery
The murder investigation opened after the woman's death in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman's 44-year-old body was full when someone was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for being killed.
The police tried to approach them who were surrounded by people who might have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: 'The investigation is still under way, but it is encouraging those around us who may have seen or heard something that worries me to come to us.
I'm also calling up for someone, especially passengers, to get a picture from his car that might help with our investigation.'
The police officer confirmed that the dead woman was living in Birkenhead and found her in the house.
This afternoon a friend who was thought to have come to the village to ask where his death was good this morning.
The investigation continues, so the police said they are now sending news to the victim's brother.
A driver living in Grayson Mews was about to come home but the police were forbidden because no one was yet able to enter or leave the former house.
He's mad when he knows what's going on.
The people there are now informed that they may be able to return to their homes within hours.
Some heard what the police said to a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the place and cried.
He kept saying that it was a disaster.
On 2 afternoon there were two police vehicles in the area that were not accessible, and another vehicle waiting outside.
However, several police officers stood in the area where they could not enter, watching a whole building.
Newspapers are invited to send direct messages to @MerPolCC, call 101 or send anonymous news to Crimestopers by number 0800 555 111 and report case 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's coat in the parliament is the last piece that has been hit by the section 'recorded history'
The release seemed to have returned to poetic form, as a result of its destruction in the same way as the Taliban did to the cultural and religious communities in England by its supporters who had become religious leaders.
The Cromwell Association said the proposal from Atoa Crick was "false" and "a plan to write the story"
John Goldsmith, a member of the Cromwell Association, stated: "It was not possible in this debate on the signing of a petition that Oliver Cromwell's photo must also be discussed in front of the Westminster Court.
But Cromwell did not order or execute the photo and tapes during the British War.
Cromwell is not to be sacrificed for what Thomas did in the past century.
The beauty of Cromwell's appearance by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft and the evidence based on the opinion found in the 19th century and part of the picture of a person who is highlighted by many today who believe that it is still worth celebrating.
The Sunday Telegraph said: "Many people today, and perhaps more than the country in the late 19th century, consider Cromwell to be the guardian of parliaments who will not be affected by external pressures, of course, on this day as the king and queen did.
However, there is still an ongoing historical debate on whether this statement is a true statement of his nature.
What is certain is that our country's development was planned later in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell was known as a form of self-responsibility in that reconciliation.
It also deserves to be celebrated and respected as Lord Protector."
A Chinese plant with a root system
A farmer lost his life when he stole the treasure from a market in southern China, said local journalists.
The man, known by the name "Yuan", was found near the well-placed house, where he had a major blood flow, he shed blood on Liupanshui's market in the province of Guizhou, when South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a cheese confectioner is preparing to make his cookies in the cheese market in Xining, Qinghai State, China.
Wednesday is the last time he and his brother came from Yunnan province to sell 15 cheeses in the market.
In the morning, her cousin saw her death, and she noticed that the door of a well-placed house opened.
He saw in it a big man's neck with his mouth covered with blood.
In an investigation, the doctor confirmed that the 250 kilograms of man who was injured and killed by the plant, the report said.
"My brother's leg is bleeding and broken," said his brother, named after the name "Wu," according to Guiyang Evening News.
A photo of a surveillance camera shows Yuan entered the market at 4 pm in the morning to ease his misery.
It was about an hour later that he died.
The animal that killed him was not Yan or his brother.
The marketing manager told Evening News that the other people's hideout had been fought alone before, until the local police collected evidence.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market's officials are arguing about the sky because he died.
In the past, though, events were heard as a result of human error.
In 2016 a married couple were injured in their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a large goat weighed 295 pounds [295 kg] on a tractor using a Welsh farm until her husband had killed the animal.
Once again, a plant in Oregon, surrounded by its well-being in 2012, said to CBC News at the time that a Manitoba plant should never grow up and that it could only be “sustained” if it heard blood.
"He's just playing.
They're hunters, they love to try... but they don't want to hurt people.
You just need to be careful in front of him," he says.
The rest of the Rossa River will bring rain in the south-west part of the United States
According to environmentalists, the Russian Gulf’s energy has been reduced by getting more hot water in the south of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry water for several days across the northern part of Mexico and the western part of the United States.
Rosa's air reached 135km per hour, which is said to be a Sokayk 1 Airport on Monday at 5 a.m., and in 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is thought that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
On the other hand, there is a depression that is starting to develop on the Pacific Ocean, so the Baja California capital is moving towards the western coast of the United States as it approaches Rosa on Sunday as a tropical storm, the tropical storm begins to rise north to the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will take a drop of blood to 25 cm in many parts of Mexico.
At that time, due to the relationship of tropical warming with the approaching depression, there will be a massive wave of heavy rains to rise in the south in a few days.
If a region reaches 2.5 cm from 10 cm in water, it will reach a watery river, the flow of potatoes and wheat, and the soil may also be polluted on the ground.
As a result of heavy tropical rains, there will be a drop of between 5 cm and 8 cm per hour in some areas, especially in some areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that 5 sm of water will reach 10 sm in some areas of the South, especially around Arizona.
Water may also be present because of the sudden deterioration of the climate, as tropical rain levels continue to expand.
It is true that the earth’s waterways should always disappear because there is a drop of tropical rain.
As a result of the floods, the canyon can turn into a strong river and also have a strong wind and rain that is based on the rain.
The growing depression will also bring rain to some areas on the southern coast of California.
There may be up to 1.5 cm of water, which can cause a flood of water and the spread of roads.
This is the first time in this region for the north.
Sunday morning and Sunday morning there will be a tropical rain that I will draw near Arizona, before the more water will grow on Monday and Tuesday.
From Tuesday to Wednesday the rain will flow across Four Corners.
In October, the U.S. bill could change a lot because the Arctic would slow down, but the tropical environment would still worsen.
Sometimes this can lead to a major change in signposts in the surrounding area.
On Sunday, there was an outstanding example of this dramatic change across the central part of the United States.
The difference between the difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, however, the heat from the autumn will try to gather and rest again.
It is expected that the beginning of October will be cut off for most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, so the map of the South Pole will reach almost 80 degrees in the north-east.
On Tuesday, the map in New York City may be 80 degrees higher, about 10 degrees higher than the moon.
It is estimated that a long-term effort is likely to be made to rise the normal salinity of the eastern part of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh's massive arrest
On Thursday, more than 20 million people were looking at the witness being tortured by Brett Kavanaugh, waiting to be appointed a member of the Supreme Court, and Queen Christine Blasey Ford, accusing him of having acted in a brutal manner in the 1980s, on the six television screen.
On the other hand, political reforms continue, and the television has shut down its program to report on the most unexpected events: an agreement signed by the Jeff Flake House of Arizona to enable the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
The Legal Committee of Ford's National Assembly told him that he could be 100 percent sure that one day he was missing Atoa Kavanaugh and started to take off his clothes during a lycée student's party.
On the other hand, in the case of a silent witness, Ato Kavanaugh answered, but he was able to make sure that 100 percent did not.
This seems to have been followed by more than 20.4 million people who were killed by Nielsen yesterday.
The company then called on the TV viewers CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
This is not yet known, however, for other television broadcasts, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also often a difficult task for the number of viewers at work.
As a simple comparison, American football viewers or Academy Awards are similar.
Fox News Channel is the head of all televisions, found researchers who strongly supported the appointment of the Kavanaugh Tower, as its viewers reached 5.69 million during the one-day full-time arrest, says Nielsen.
ABC, on the other hand, has a second audience of 3,26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBCs got 2.94 million, MSNBC found 2.89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, says Nielsen.
People are still very interested after the arrest.
It's Flake that everyone focused on the events of the past summer.
When the office of this moderate Republican House said that it would support Kavanaugh's attack on the strike, CNN and CBS were able to capture a picture of the protestors trying to get into an ascensor to save their arrest by the Legal Committee.
He stood up but looked at the crowd for a few minutes, as seen directly on CNN TV.
"I'm standing here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
Someone said to him, "You have authority, but a lot of women don't see divorce."
My office has already issued a statement, Atoa Flake, and it added before the Ascenseur concluded that there is something else to say during the committee's arrest.
After that, all television broadcasts on trains and children were organized directly, during the time of the Committee's decision to assign the Kavanaugh Tower to the entire Parliament.
But Flake said he wouldn't do that if the FBI didn't agree to do a week earlier to investigate the accused of this person, according to a few Democrats.
The Lord Chris Coons, Democracy, was one of the winners of the talks he had with his friends.
Flake agreed after talking to Atoa Coons and a few heads after that.
There was a strong choice for Flake because it indicated that the Republican authorities would not agree to the appointment of Cavanaugh Stone without the investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh's charges.
Prime Minister May called on his critics to play 'political' games about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his plans to escape from the European Union, saying that "political play" in the future of Britain and the country's interests are being undermined during the Sunday Times conference.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, September 29, 2018, came to meet with the Conservative Party Meeting in Birmingham, Britain.
In an interview near one of the Prime Minister's first page, Mr. Boris Johnson, former Foreign Minister, confirmed his claim to the form Chequers for Brexit, stating that the suggestion that Britain and the European Union should both be "simply wrong".
The arrest of Wade Sims: Dytheon Simpson was arrested by the police, worried that the LSU player had died
The police arrested a man worried about the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dytheon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and imprisoned for killing a wounded man, says the baton Rouge police station.
The exchange between Sims and Simpson was released by the authorities to be seen by the public, and the police announced that Sims' lawyer was missing during the war.
Police sent the witness from the crime scene, and announced that he had found Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB's report, working for CBS.
When Simpson was kidnapped, the police said he agreed to shoot and killed Wade.
The value of his temporary freedom has been defined as 350,000, says one spokesman.
Zoma published a preliminary report by the East Baton Rouge Parish National Refugee Bureau, and it was said that the death led to a shooting from the head to the tent.
This service thanked the team of investigators who escaped from the state police in Louisiana, the state-owned crime relief laboratory, the police at the Southern University and the citizens around the investigation and allowed this arrest to take place.
According to Joe Alleva, the LSU athletes were grateful to the local police for their “planning and ongoing search for the truth.”
Sims is now 20 years old.
This 1m82 Baton Rouge is the largest in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball in the LSU in that city.
During the past year, he has included 5.6 numbers and has captured 2.6 balls each game in general.
Tomorrow morning, LSU's basketball coach, Atoa Will Wade, said the team was "full" and "hard" when he heard Wade's death.
"That's what worries people all the time," said Atoa Wade.
Volcanoes in Mexico City
The storm from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern city of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention warned the people of Mexico on Saturday to avoid the volcano because there was an incident in its mouth and 183 cases were recorded in writing within 24 hours.
There are also a number of noises and reflections from the nearby area.
The image of a snowflake in many cities around Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, draws on the social network.
The geographers and the Earth observe that the events in the volcano that took place in 72 km south of the capital since the earthquake reached 7.1 degrees in mid-Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been alive since 1994.
The police and Catalan refugees argued as they approached the memory of the loss of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday when protesters fought against the police for independence, and thousands of people took part in the march to mark the first year of Catalonia's film film.
A number of people broke off from police officers who were not going to make progress, but went out of the barracks and the mud, and the streets should be full of visitors for such a long time.
There was also a riot that occurred and the police used cookies to separate the fighters.
Several hours of independence groups singing "There's nothing to hide, there's no crime" were faced with the country's partners calling "The Long Life of Spain."
Forty-six people were treated for minor injuries to protesters, local journalists say.
The war in the areas of independence continues to be two years after a public investigation, which Madrid said was illegal, but the Catalans celebrated.
Almost all voters chose to be self-sustained, but a few came to vote because they refused to participate in the march against discrimination.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people have been injured in recent years if the police are about to stop the loss of stones from the roads around the region.
A number of people shared their independence during Friday night to prevent those who tried to protest to support the national police.
There was only one shortcut but another one has to be used.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, was a power-driven tool manager who met with his wife’s partner, who no longer believed that Catalonia would be free again.
"Last year we had the best thing to do.
I remember my parents going to sea because they were able to climb a rock, but we are on our way," he said.
Even though the Catalan self-restraints have been able to win a victory, which was held by the majority during the last December elections, this year the party has been concerned about the risk of having an abortion since many of its leaders have become on the ground or in prison waiting for a trial to be held for the public trial and subsequently declared independence.
42-year-old Joan Puig, a car manufacturer, filmed the protest to support the police on his cell phone, announced that politicians from both sides and side of the scene are now suffering from this disorder.
"The army is always on the move," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned since his trial year, announced that he will be elected to be a member of the European Parliament next year.
"To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to read out the bold democratic values and the woodcuts we see from the government in Spain," he said.
Londonsderry: A battle in the house, several men arrested
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested when a car broke down several times in a house in Londonsderry.
The accident took place in the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, 7 o'clock, and some BST tomorrow morning.
The doors and walls of the house were very damaged, says Det Insp Bob Bloomings.
There may also have been shooting boys who went to the house this morning.
Livingston won Rangers from 1 to 0 from Menga
The first prize of Dolly Menga for Livingston has been won
Livingston's race is fast running, only a second blow for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as the leader of his Ibrox team.
It's Dolly Menga's fate has changed, as Gary Holt's team is able to match Hibernian in number two.
Gerrard's team in the Premiership in this game has not yet won a win in the country and will now compete with Hearts, who have the title and have an eight-digit gain.
Before that, however, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna this afternoon, in Europe League.
Livingston has not yet won this game in this new division, as Holt has been winning since he passed on to Kenny Miller a month ago.
Livingston can't face a bloodless stranger
Holt's team continued to guide the way before he died, because their attacks have caused various problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson just broke up but didn't break the ball when he hit the head, and then Alan Lithgow was not able to do it again except when he was beaten up by Craig Halket on his head.
The householder did not hesitate to let Rangers play in front of them, as he knew he could do what he could to attract his guests to the best seats.
And it seems that the number that changed the story was the most.
The Rangers made a mistake leading a cop-franc and Livingston was looking for a way to walk, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined Menga's way, who actually got the ball and refused from the middle of the day.
The Rangers were still on the coast, but they had never read the householder's instructions, so much so that if there was a threat to Liam Kelly's garden guard,
This seems to be the case during the second time, even though there was a case from Alfredo Morelos that Kelly had to arrest immediately.
Scott Pitttman was about to be killed, but this was written by Allan McGregor, the Rangers' vigilant guard, and then Lithgow's uncle was very disappointed when he received a good gift from the Liverston player.
Not only did the gang come to Livingston's castle but it was still banned, and there were also two pins — one of the consequences of Halket's crimes against the playwright Glenn Middleton, and one of the results of the shooting with his hands — but he was forced to go out altogether.
Livingston's experience was 'no like that' - compression
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, to the Macaroni Arena Tower
Livingston's play and performance did not look like it.
Each of them did not have any business, and they do not stop doing more than they may now be able to do.
There has been little change in how they play and how they manage the team since they get back to the top, but Holt has been particularly concerned about the team's skills as long as they arrive.
There are also many experts in his team.
Captain Halket's performance was great, leading to the ultimate protection of the program, but Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to go free during the game.
However, the Rangers did not seem to have been able to do so.
They may play well at times under the leadership of Gerard, but they have not reached their goal here.
Their attacks are not always slow – they are only once removed from the range – so they should now be threatened by Rangers, since they are now not below ground.
Erdogan's reception in Cologne is still very confusing
The evening (September 29th) was short and blue during the morning meal held by the Turkish and German presidents in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's most critical visit to Germany – which has been made to strengthen the relationship between the fighters in the NATO.
Among the topics that they have ignored are human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
After that, President Erdogan arrived in Cologne to support a new major Moscow.
This city is the largest country in Turkey outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 people were banned by the police from meeting in front of the mosque, but there are still many supporters coming to see their president.
However, most of the opposition to Erdogan – and Kurdes – expressed their opinion and condemned Erdogan's policies and Germany's willingness to adopt them.
The image of the foreign religion is seen in that protest, some Turkishs calling German citizenship a savior, but others accused it of being a prisoner.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The driver killed the driver of the car
The driver in London lost his life.
In the vicinity of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, the city's busiest street in Deptford, east of the city, took place at 10 a.m. and 15 a.m. BST.
The car stopped, and a doctor came to take care of it, but the man died of a lack of water.
The accident occurred several months after the driver died in a car accident that escaped from the Children's Street, some miles away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to know about the man and to listen to his family.
The road was thus opened and the reporters had to travel by road and were invited to choose another route immediately.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prison Guards in the Shadow · Global Voices
Six prison guards injured during a prison in a nice prison for men, says the Prison Bureau.
Tomorrow morning at 9 hours and some BST began the attack at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire; and it is not yet completed.
A special police officer called "Tornado" was asked to come here to clean up the mess, which produces eight prisoners, in a house in a prison.
The prison guards were treated locally for mild wounds in their face.
The prison service reported: "A special trained prison guard has been ordered to destroy the problems that occur in HMP Long Lartin.
Six prison guards were treated for his injuries.
We never expose the violence in prison, and our statement is clear that the security officers have to give the police their time."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including prisoners of the country's greatest threat.
According to a report in June, the prison chief had to be admitted to a hospital when a prisoner was arrested.
And in October, some prison guards had to call a police officer for a huge bug that had fired a billard ball.
The Rosa River threatens to produce rivers in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (may be a privilege for the region of drought)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it can occur at the beginning of the week, as the rest of the desert Southwest continues to read out of the Rosa River, and is afraid to produce water.
Eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, have already issued a warning of the sea.
Rosa is thought to be heading to Phoenix for three days, bringing water to her in the afternoon.
Phoeix's national environmental company tweeted that "the tropical weather with tropical temperatures or depression when in 260 km around Phoenix is ten" since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is the only airport that has reached 60 km near the AZ region."
According to the latest estimates published by the National Weather Survey model, the flux can reach 5 cm to 10 cm, and it can reach 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
The other area in the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, may be 2.5 cm from 5 cm, but there may be some place to reach 10 cm.
For those who are not worried about getting water first, Rosa’s water may be a blessing because it is an area of the world’s end.
It is true that there is a great deal of concern about the water supply, but it may be good to get a drop of blood because the South is now on the horizon.
According to the U.S. Office of Observers, more than 40 percent of Arizona's people are seriously suffering, the second most serious problem, reports weather.com.
The Rosa River is first considered to enter the country in the Gulf of Baja California in Mexico.
In 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico is the Rosa River, which runs north at 20 km per hour.
The climate is shrinking because the Pacific Ocean is hotter.
Therefore, it is thought that it will become a tropical storm when the sun enters Mexico on Monday or Sunday morning.
Mexico may have a heavy share of blood pressure, and it may cause massive flooding.
"It is estimated that from 7.5 cm to 15sm, Baja California will be able to remain in the north-west of Sonora, and that may reach 25 cm in some places," says weather.com.
Then Rosa, who is already tropical in the north of Mexico at that time, will walk to the limit of Arizona on Tuesday mornings in the form of tropical depression, rise to Arizona again and come to the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The most significant disaster in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwest desert in the United States is the most serious accident that is thought to be facing Rosa or her escape zone," says the National Centre for Disaster Control.
As a result of this rain, there will always be a river that will die and the floods of trees and rocks in the land, and the flooding of mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Arrest of four people who were planning to kill
A 20-year-old girl and a 20-year-old boy were arrested because she was threatened with attempted murder when 16-year-olds were found in Somerset.
In Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, the baby was diagnosed with a serious illness, the hot Saturday about 4 o'clock in the morning BST.
She was rushed to the hospital immediately and was said to be "free of worry."
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man was arrested on the night around Radstock, says police in Avon and Somerset.
The police asked people who might have got pictures of what happened on their cell phone to get close to them.
Kavanaugh said about Trump: "The love and anger of the Democratic Party has been affected."
"The loss of stones for Judge Kavanaugh is a loss of stones to eliminate the unsolicited and delicacy of the Democratic Party," said Atoa Trump during a public arrest in Wheeling, West Virginia.
On Trump announced that during the Kavanaugh's mandate, the latter was "encouraged by the passion and anger" of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh stood before the Congress, and he carefully rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that they had been doing something horrible to him ten years ago, when they were both children.
During that time, Ford also took a stand for the charges against him.
The President said on Saturday that the day Kavanaugh's "the American people will find the courage, skill and courage" that day.
"The battle to strengthen the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most perfect legislators in our time, a well-known judge of the people's service so far," he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The President has failed to speak about the importance of the arrival of the Republican candidate during his election by using the President to talk about the appointment of the Kavanaugh Tower.
"Five weeks ago one of the most important elections in our lives will come.
I don't want to be a soldier, but if it's true, I want to be a soldier," he says.
"That's why I'm going to fight for the best candidates."
Trump stated that democracy is even taking a "reconsistencies and obstacles" course.
The final summer should be the first important milestone in the House of Commons in the Kavanaugh Summit, CNN's senior GOP leader.
Hundreds of people have lost their lives because of the earthquake, tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing.
A total of 384 people contributed to their lives, many of whom suffered shipwreck at sea after a massive earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, said authorities on this Saturday.
There were hundreds of people gathered to meet at a sea party in Palu, a ship that had reached six feet [6 m] in the morning, and many people were injured and destroyed everything they had lost.
Before the tsunami there were 7.5 earthquakes in the desert.
"When yesterday's tsunami hit, people continued their work on the sea, not leaving, but became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the BNPB spokesman, a natural disaster office in Indonesia, during a talk in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, but hit the car, wood, house, and all that hit it in the black soil," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami’s shift to the sea was 800 km an hour before it hits the lake.
There was a man who cut wood that the tsunami didn't break and who didn't kill him, he said.
A total of 16,700 people were transferred to 24 shelters in Palu.
The photos taken from above by the Natural Disaster Bureau show that many houses and shops are destroyed, destroyed, destroyed, and destroyed.
The city that created the sea on Saturday was still surrounded by waves from the earthquake.
2.4 million people live in the region who have experienced these devastating earthquakes.
The Indonesian Institute for Technology Analysis and Application (BPPT) said that the nuclear bomb that went through Hiroshima during the Second Great War was about 200 times around the energy generated by this major earthquake.
The tsunami may have increased the size of the tsunami, they say, the city's geography, which is based on the lake of a long river.
Nugroho stated that the damage was “great” and thousands, he said, houses, hospitals, shops and hotels were destroyed.
There are deaths from broken homes, he says, and 540 people are injured and 29 are not injured.
Nugroho has said that there may be more casualties and damage, in the area of Donghea, 300 km north of Palu, as it is the nearest of the earthquake.
"Selevisions are very popular because there is no good news," Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” says my Red Paper in the statement, and its employees and volunteers have already saved their areas of destruction.
"This is very serious, but the situation may still be bad for now," he said.
On Saturday this work was criticized for not saying that there was a tsunami that took Palu, even though the authorities said that shortly after the warning, the storm came.
There's a picture of people who have posted on social networks with men on top of the street calling for people's food on the streets below that there's a tsunami.
A few minutes after the storm struck the lake, it left all the houses or cars.
Reuters could not determine whether the image file is valid.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunamis, the city's traffic has been slowed down and no one has been able to internet around Palu, so it is difficult for the authorities to manage the weather effort.
The authorities said that the army had already started sending troops, bringing help from Jakarta and other cities, but many of the displaced people still need food and shelter in the morning.
The city's airport has been opened for a lifetime, and will continue to be shut down in October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was told to visit the camps that had been set up in Palu.
More than 800 people died from tsunamis in Indonesia.
This is a very bad thing.
It is true that World Vision workers from Donghea have been restored to justice in Palu, where there are refugees in the labour market, but they have seen a lot of damage around the road, says Atoa Doseba.
"They have a lot to see," he said.
This is a very bad thing.
Many of the relief teams are now engaged in the intense post-natural disaster, but some complain that a large number of foreign workers are being prevented from going to Palu.
According to the law in Indonesia, there must have been a national declaration that a natural disaster affected a place where a victim could enter a fee, configuration and worker from abroad.
However, there was no record of such proclamation.
"The natural disaster is still in the first place," says Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the state says, "Well, this natural disaster is a whole country," it can be opened for international assistance, but we are not yet here."
This is the second night in Palu since the earthquake and tsunami, and friends and family of those who have not yet experienced the loss of their freedom are still hoping to be among the few miracles that bring happiness in this natural disaster.
Saturday was a small child who was shot alive from a cold water stream.
On Sunday, the victim released a woman in a van for two days, along with her mother's death near her.
Gendon Subandono, the national Indonesian paradigm team, trained two undisputed candidates for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia early this month.
He is also a student of other areas in the Two Two Hotel, including the Mandige Bridge.
"My heart is heavy, as my self-sustained in the parapente area," he says.
Atoa Gendon reported that a few hours after the news spread among the horsemen that the Two Two Hotel was destroyed, he posted a number of messages via whatsApp, who took part in a seaming meeting.
However, the message he sent is only one color symbol, not two blue characters.
"I believe they didn't even protect the message I sent," he said.
The buyer went $26,750 during the GAB supplementing in Newport at Level
Friday morning, the buyer spent $26,750 on $26,750 by the Brink's employees who had taken GAB to Newport at Level, according to a press release from the Police Office in Newport.
The driver released the car in the GAB in a parking lot and prepared to install additional money, says Det. Dennis McCarthy in the statement.

Newport police are encouraged to call on 859-292-3680 who are aware of these people.
Kanyye West: The rap singer changed his name to Ye
Rap Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter on Saturday when he said his name was changed: "The official name Kanye West."
There was a time, 41-year-old West, who received the name Yes and made it the title of his eight-year-old file, which came out of June.
Before his release on Saturday Night Live, which is thought to produce his new file called Yandhi, the current name.
He is the stranger who will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who left the classroom immediately for “a emotional reason,” says the program’s creator.
West stated that he also had a religious view of the name he is using today.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of the year, when he talked about the title of his file to the provider of the Big Boy radio program.
"So I am and you are, we are.
So it started with Kane, which means it's the only one, and it comes to Yes – nothing but the good, the bad, the bad, the bad, all of us.
This configuration file contains more information about us."
He was one of several popular rap singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs, for example, has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he should be called Love and Brother Love.
His colleague, JAY-Z, who also admitted that his name could always be either a protest case or a written or written document.
AMLO in Mexico claims that the military will not use the military to fight civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Mr. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, felt that it was important for him to use the military force to fight civilians, as the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed that resulted from the persecution of the students.
On Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that "he would like to send soldiers to kill Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army fired peaceful protesters in the area, and not less than 300 of them died, during a time when the student movement was reconfirmed to the left-hand side of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans with a monthly grant for students and to open a new state university.
It is the lack of work and the inability to learn that makes young people forced to save a wicked society.
The cost of I.A. should be increased by the United States twice as high.
China is already making great progress in the field of artificial intelligence (IA), so it should also increase its use for research in this area, says Atoa Kai-Fu Lee, a money user and IA, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This was the comment he made when a different department in the U.S. Government made a statement about IA, even though a whole United States has no official plans for IA.
In the meantime, China has announced its plan last year: it has been focusing on the reform of the IA by 2030.
"It's good to start with a two-fold increase in IA research, as the United States is closer than any other country, and we are waiting for the most extraordinary information for IA," says Lee.
When the budget increases twice as high as the US is, Lee says during the CBC interview this week, the energy in the United States will be twice as high as the next major changes in the IA's world.
Like Lee, who wrote the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the General Tale of the Innovation Ventures, which created one of the major companies of IA in China, Face+.
He was in his 80s, at Carnegie Mellon University, working on an IA system that won the most successful American Othello players, and after that he was a top member of Microsoft Research and the head of the Google branch in China.
Lee admits that it's good to have a competition on technology organized by the former U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked himself when the next part was going to be able to get to know the future's experts.
Lee often says that researchers in the United States need to work hard to obtain government funding.
"But China does not force the academic leaders out; it's the company," Lee just said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology-based companies have been targeted by various universities to focus on the IA area.
It may also help the US to speed up its efforts for the AI, Lee, says the change in the immigration policy.
"My friend should immediately give me a red card for the IA Doctorats," he said.
In July 2017 the Chinese Government Council issued the IA Development Plan in its new form.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations for American researchers, provides funding to people at the educational center, but lowers the quality of the academic work in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year in the United States, the Ministry of Defence has set up the International Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is designed to unite industry and education workers, and Maison Blanche has announced that the Committee is now developing to focus on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month in DARPA that it would pay $2 billion for the event called AI Next.
For the NSF, it now accounts for more than $100 million for the IA research.
Meanwhile, no action has been taken on the law in the United States aimed at setting up the National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence.
Elections in Macedonia are under pressure to change the country's name in public polls
On Sunday, voters in Macedonia will be questioned whether the country's name will be "North Republic of Macedonia", a measure that will reduce the ten-year absence of Greece, which prevented their intention to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, has always been affected by the name of the country surrounding it in the north, and has kept its entry into the NATO and the European Union.
The new name was agreed upon by the two regimes in June, but there are opposing nationalists saying that if the name is changed, many Slavs will be able to be respected in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not throw stones during the poll, and the result of his refusal not to participate in the campaign was fear that the 50 percent demand for public opinion would be met by voters.
The question is, "Do you agree to enter the NATO and the European Union by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said that we should accept the value of a movement such as the European Group and the NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia's violence.
"I am here today to raise a stone for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live in freedom under the care of the European Union because it means a better life for all of us," says Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the law does not specify that it has to be followed, the number of parliaments already said that it will follow the results of the strikes in order to make it change immediately.
Two-thirds of parliamentarians are required to accept the amendment.
The National Electoral Commission said no reports of invalidity had been reported since 1 o'clock in the morning.
However, not more than 16 percent of voters have been elected, when 34 percent have been elected during the last parliamentary election in 2016, which is 66 percent of the candidates named after the vote.
"Because of my child, I threw stones, because we should be in Europe," says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an elected man in the capital of Skopje.
In Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, came to the press to investigate the country's name to open the door to the NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old in Skopje, prepared a small platform and laid a table before the house set up by the builders not to participate in the public investigation.
"We wish to join the NATO and the European Union, but we want to do so with honor rather than with the media," Kavadarkov says.
"It is true that we are a poor country, even if we have a lot of ships.
When our name is not available to them, we can return to China and Russia and join the European and Asia Declaration Group."
The entry into the NATO will lead to a very urgent use of funds for Macedonia, says Prime Minister Zaev, as unemployment rates have already increased by over 20 percent.
"I believe that this is what most of the population is going through because more than 80 percent of the citizens appreciate the presence of the European Union and the NATO," said Atoa Zaev after the vote.
The victory of "yes" will be like "the strengthening of our future."
As a result of a simple survey published by the Office of the High Commissioner for Political Research in Macedonia on Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will be coming to press for public opinion – that is, less than the required number.
But another simple survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
But 70 percent said they would choose "yes".
The 50 percent of voters contributing to a voter are required to come to the vote, which can only be said to have succeeded in the polling process.
If this poll is to be completed, it will be the first major obstacle to Western government policies since it took place in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City broke down all the Bridgetons and died of a balloon
The Brighton rebellion was defeated by Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling when Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seems that Aguero's pooling in 65 minutes is easy.
A fireman from Argentina received an offer from the center of the camp.
He left between the first three Brighton riots, then launched a free rescue.
Aguero was suddenly surrounded by four white players.
He moved quickly behind a bridge, then ran away from the train on the east side of Brighton's bridge.
Then he left the ball to the left, so Sterling could.
When the British army banned the first football in the field, it was returned to Aguero, who banned the right and shot Matthew Ryan, Brighton's security guard, because the ball was in his right armpit.
"Aguero's right leg has a little problem," said Pep Guardiola, the city manager, to a journalist.
"We told him he'd only play in 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what's going on.
We were very proud that he was killed by a ball at the time."
Sterling but gave Sky Blues the first prize in this game for the Premier League.
He died in 29 minutes.
Aguero was then granted a service in the country of Brighton.
It's great to see the bag he sent the ball to get Leroy Sane's brother.
Sane tried to advance the ball before leading Sterling to the far edge.
The fighter Sky Blues has almost gone out of the area.
The city will meet Hoffenheim in a group for the Championships League in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer's desire to play at a meeting with Rockies
There was no reason to push to play first, as the Nationals are no longer involved in the end process.
However, Scherzer wanted to be very competitive so if he would take the ball this Sunday at a meeting with Colorado Rockies, the only measure was that the end process had an impact on the Rockies' approach, since they had a prize for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies got the yoker's place when the Nationals won 5-2 last night, but it's still hoping to get the first division's increase.
"Even if we don't have anything to fight anymore, at least we're tired because we know that the air will not go away during the Denver game with the viewers and other teams that I'm sure will produce the best in them, more than the best I've ever seen this year.
How can I not stand to fight it?"
So far the Nationals have not announced who will play first on Sunday, but it seems that Scherzer is the one who might be able to beat the ball if this is the case.
On Sunday, Scherzer, who is going to meet the 34th game first if he does, and he's going to take a ball on Sunday, even on a few holidays.
It has a number of 18-7 right-wing football players in Washington, and for this game year it has an ERA 2.53 and a stripout 300 in 220 2/3.
President Trump killed people in West Virginia
The President has done a little bit about what he has chosen to be appointed to the Supreme Court, in the matter of the importance of the arrival of the Republican voter during his election.
"The month of November is the most important thing to us.
The last five weeks will be the most important election in our lives.
This is part of the main, most important -- I don't want to fight but if I really want to vote, which is why I'm going to fight for these good candidates," he says.
President Trump continued, "You see these very evil democratic groups, what they are doing now we say.
And they're ready to regain power in all ways, you see the beauty, the misery.
They don't care who they are, who they have to get power and control, what they need, power and control, but we won't give them that."
Democracy has taken a move "to oppose and stop," he says.
"And you see what it has been in four days," he said, saying that the democracy is "fashioned, angry, bad, and not to tell the truth."
He specifically named the Dianne Feinstein Democratic House in the House of Justice, which was rejected by the audience.
"Do you remember his answers?
Have you published a document?
Oh, yeah, how?
No, mm, no, I'm waiting for one – that's the worst move I've ever seen."
The Labor Party is no longer a free congregation.
He does not give up on those who show an interest in him
It's no wonder that the Momentum attackers in our village party threw stones at me for questioning.
In fact, I'm the last parliament of the Labour saying that I don't need my opinion – the reason is simple: I'm grateful for the comment.
No one else has received Joan Ryan, my colleague of parliament, because he has never been able to stand up against the Jews' enemies.
For me personally, my opposition to Jeremy Corbyn's opinion was caused by the beatings that criticized me.
The economic policy of responsibility, national security, Europe, which is a reflection of Jeremy’s communication with the former leaders.
This is what the announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labor said on Friday: "We wish the meeting to be attended by everyone and to be present."
During the more than eight years that I have been Parliamenting the Labour, these GC meetings have been well kept in place every Friday night.
Sadly, however, the climate of many meetings is not the same now, and it has been a long time since, even though the political promise has begun to be “better and easier” than ever.
The disagreement in the Labour Party was clearly unacceptable and the public opinion that the party's leader agreed was correct.
A short time after meeting Jeremy's leader, there was a colleague with whom I thought that I had a political outlook in the past that started waiting for me to turn around and accept a view that I could not accept at all — whether on national protection or on the European Union’s dominant market.
Every time I take public speaking – whatever I say – criticisms always come on the social network calling for my name to be removed, criticism of my central party's policy, saying that I should not be in the Labor party.
And it didn't happen to me alone.
I know well that it's easier to get to me than to get some employees because I'm the only one who can make a statement about politics.
I was surprised to see the professional and controversial work of fellow workers who are facing criticism of a man or a woman on a daily basis but never shy.
It is one of the most disturbing aspects of our political era to see what kind of language has become acceptable to all.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of diffusion.
The truth is that we are no longer the free congregation of the past, and each of the parties has a lack of "trust rules" or a change in the rules on election of members.
For the past two years, many of those who have offered me a simple and unsatisfied walk, saying, "I don't care."
But that is not what I decided to do.
Since I attended the 32-year-old Labour Party that if I was still a student, since I was a member of thatcher's government who had allowed the public school I had studied to be destroyed, I have always fought to improve public affairs for those who need it — whether city councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my policy, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could say that I did not understand my political views and things that I did not share with the rulers.
The only thing I want to say to those who promote the loss of weight in Friday, when we see a country moving forward to Brexit that will have a negative impact on many marriages, businesses and public affairs, I don't understand what I can do to get time and energy to tell the leader of the Labour Party.
But the truth is that my message is not for Nottingham Momentum but for people, whether a member of the Labour Party or not: I respect your ability to serve and I promise that there will be no threat to the construction or use of politics to prevent me from taking what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie will not be a parliamentarian for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Ayr is on top, which is never lost
The last two days may have changed little shape, but it is no doubt worth Ayr's winning this first game of Tennent for the Premiership this day, which has really been a great success.
They are now on top, because they are the only ones left or once in ten.
In fact, the victory team has gained the dignity of its defence and its ability to use the case, and Peter Murchie is the most just to be happy.
"Our way of playing is still under ban, but no one's been listening to us, so I have to be happy," he said.
This is what Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The Father is honored, because they have been more powerful than our team."
Grant Anderson made a move in the 14th minute, which was confirmed by Frazier Climo, which rewarded Ayr, but Rory Hughes, captain of Scotland, who had been released by Warriors before, enabled Melrose to take advantage of the lack of numbers and was finally arrested by Jason Baggot.
Climo had a penance that covered the gain of Ayr, and then, first of all, he had lost only one ball and had to print it and the number of Ayr's leading at the end of the day was 17-5.
However, the second time for Melrose was a good start, and after Patrick Anderson's death, which was forced by Baggot, he reduced to five remaining numbers.
At that time there was a long period of time for the serious injury that Ruarhyk Knott, who had to be forced out of the area, and when the game was over again, Ayr was released through the day of Stafford McDowell, quoted by Climo.
This is where Blair Macpherson, a temporary captain for Ayr, again seized Melrose's position and Bruce Colvine was able to win despite the defeat, after a short contest.
However, the city was still occupied, so when Struan Hutchinson got a heavy ticket for passing Climo without a ball, from the pentalate sign, MacPherson threw the ball behind the line, from behind the Ayr's closet.
Climo chose the rape case, as he did after the game was returned, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's rank from the rules and offered a bid to kill the fifth day of the mayor's team.
The star of Still Game seems ready to start a new job in the dining room industry
Ford Kieran, a player at the Still Game, seems willing to start a new job in the reception industry, knowing that he was appointed head of a company that had received permission to build a food house.
He's 56 years old, and he's playing Jack Jarvis's part in the famous BBC program, which he wrote and played with Greg Hemhill, a long time ago with him.
He told them that this program will end the nine-part edition, and if Kiernan is found, life after Craiglang is ready.
According to the official document, he is the head of the Affômorn Limited.
The actor didn't answer the question about this news, but a news source in Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan is trying to get into the "very open world for a restaurant" in Glasgow.
'We are the sea': Bolivia, which has no borders, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
La Paz is the main ship's shipyard.
A state office that spreads white sand like the sea.
The Lake Titicaca Marine camp is full of inscriptions such as: "We can have the sea.
We forget to take it again."
Bolivia still has a scar on the memory of the loss of Chile's coast during the 19th century bloody war for its resources, and the desire to swim back to the Pacific Ocean is no more.
Perhaps that hope is not as alive as it has now been in the ten years since Bolivia is now awaiting the international court ruling on October 1, when they were sentenced for five years.
"Bolivie has already taken good care of, united and positive, and full of hope for what will be possible," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice (ICJ)'s ruling on television across the country, hoping that the La Haye court will accept Bolivia's request but - after a ten-year discussion – Chile will have to discuss how to give Bolivia a route to the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivier president of Bolivia, also looks forward to much of the decision to issue on Sunday – which is facing a war that will slow him down again in the next year.
"It's time for us to return to the Pacific Ocean," he tweeted at the end of August.
Some readers, however, feel that the court cannot be certain to give Bolivia justice - and even to give him justice is seldom possible if there is to be a change.
The United Nations team working in the Netherlands has no authority to give part of Chile's land to others, and it has already said that it cannot be considered as the last word as a result of any possible discussion.
The fact that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the case was "unconstitutional," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia will never meet its demands four years ago, but it will be even more humiliating.
"The current Bolivian government has addressed this issue on its way to the sea," Zárate said.
The way Morales talked about things may have caused the rest of the killing in Chile to last, he says.
Bolivia and Chile will have to re-examine each other later, but it is difficult to discuss the case after this.
Since 1962, two countries have not been free of charge.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representing Bolivia in La Haye, rejected the fact that the execution of the court is not as common as it is this time.
This Sunday will bring "a good way to open a new relationship with Chile" to Bolivia, he says, and it is time to pursue "the 139-year-old lack of communication through the way it works."
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales — one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the issue of seawater as a political tool.
"Bolivie will never release his right to access the Pacific Ocean," he adds.
"We will see what we need to do in the past."
North Korea will never destroy nuclear weapons unless it can trust the US
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said about Ri Yong Ho that they would never destroy the first nuclear weapons if Washington could not trust them.
On Saturday at Ri, the United Nations Conference was held in front of the UN.
He urged the United States to implement the promise made during a summit in Singapore in the presidential office of these developing countries.
That's what he said if US Secretary Mike Pompeo is as small as the last time he's opened up the nuclear diplomacy as it was, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's leader.
Ri stated that the idea is "suddenly inspired" that the declaration that the war in Korea is about to destroy North Korea is imminent.
However, Pyongyang warns Washington to accept the statement but does not take a significant step towards the destruction of weapons.
Neither Kim nor American President Donald Trump wants to hold a second meeting.
But many don't believe Pyongyang is really willing to collect the weapons that can be sure that the country will take his life as security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the upper month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The latest results on the main lead chain that will soon come to you from a nearby high-ranking store in Paris
Do not seek further if you seem to want to help the amount of your fuel or to prevent the sun from getting you completely out of it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne reported the headache, which is a bad idea to include in the section called SS19, on the platform that identified the method of exercise during Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram, large amounts of soap have been collected if these can be used this year, and they have been sent by clothing manufacturers to the mouthpieces of their mouthpieces.
For example, Valentino's most unusual perfume is another large, yellow - haired hair, with a large hair like that of a bee that completely covered the head of the hunter.
One of the main pillars found there is the heavy metal roofs, the majeures, and some of them were still in existence - but they were not even made to shake our head.
There are also a number of strange pictures shown by Thom Browne – very timely for Halloween.
Most of the photos look so glamorous, and it doesn't look like Hannibal Lecter.
There is a tendency that they have created, for example, the same phenomenon as the fencing machine, which is made from air-conditioning and the eye, but the same one is like the dining room, but it has been called.
And if you continue to show a unique fashion, you're a hero.
The observer suggests that these expensive goods may come to you from high-end retailers.
The words on the side of 'La Bomba' have been heard, which has already been made of the black bag with half a meter of hair, either Rihanna or Emily Rattakowski.
There was also another major creation work that showed the most famous character, which created many of these ingredients if they could be used – a frozen package on the seabed, made of black butter and needed to be much like the dressmaker who wore it.
It is an old-fashioned rofia box, with a yellow-haired rofia, the most important creative work of Jacquemus's results in the La Riviera SS19 series shown during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a designer for famous people, wrote to the F.C.C.: 'I imagine that the heavy fuel and the ship’s shipping bags will come to the top of the ocean next year – there has been a lot of confusion about the creation of the shipmaker himself and the future will be difficult to see without the request of people to have a great deal of intelligence.'
John Edward: The world's citizens need foreign language skills
The independent schools in Scotland are known for having finished, and this continued in 2018 because the results are good, and the success of individuals and teams in sports, art, music and other popular events has increased.
More than 30,000 students throughout Ecosse are also working hard on these schools, which the Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) has presented themselves to provide them with the best education for students and parents.
The aim of the school is to support its students for higher education and higher education, for their careers and for the world’s capital.
Since the education sector is capable of organizing and implementing educational programmes for each school, we now see that only modern languages are part of a large range of voters and students in the school.
Nelson Mandela says: "When you talk to someone in his language, your words come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his speech, your words come to his mind."
It's a prison reminder that we can't just eat in English if we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
As we look at the final results for this year, it is evident that foreign languages lead to the most well-known ethnic groups in the students of independent schools.
In fact, 68 percent of foreign students received at least 19/20.
This news, which is available in 74 SCIS schools, shows that 72 percent of students received 19/20 in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish received 19/20.
It shows that foreign education is supported by schools that do not rely on Scotland because your skills will be very important for children and young people later.
Now the foreign language, as a unique source of selection, is equal to STEM (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey of the United Kingdom's Commission for Employment and Skills, the U.S. Board found that considering why users said it would make it difficult for them to introduce their employees, 17 percent because of the lack of help from foreign experts.
Thus, foreign language is an integral part of the process of preparing young people for their future careers.
It is vital that you do so in this world of peace, as the number of foreign-language skills demands keeps increasing.
Whatever a person's job is, if he learns foreign, he will receive a great reward in the future as he can be used for his future life.
Those who know a number of languages will continue to benefit from their competitors because they can communicate directly to foreigners.
According to a standard YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not know foreign languages in order to speak simply, and only French is the language of 15 percent of them.
This is an important factor in raising money to improve foreign education today, for children today.
Those who speak a number of languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will benefit from finding a job that they should live.
Every school in Scotland will be different from the national language they teach.
There will be a number of schools focusing on the education of modern languages already available, but some will teach what is considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in the years 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s background, there are several foreign languages that you can always choose from an independent school, and your teacher is a specialist in that.
The school that is independent in Scotland is willing to focus on creating a world of education to prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is not possible at this time, in the world of insurance, that foreign languages are still dependent on the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
It is true that foreign languages should be accepted as "enlightened by international networks"
The independent school will continue to offer options, differences and perfect working methods for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward The Independent School Council
LeBron will play first on the Lakers in San Diego this Sunday
There will be little waiting for fans who want to see LeBron James play first in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, a Lakersian, announced that James will play this Sunday during the first game for the pre-legal period, to live with the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
Still, he does not know how long he will be playing.
"There must be more than one and at least 48," said Walton at Lakers' official website.
Lakers' special journalist, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James's time might be limited.
Journalist James asked about what he would do during the six games until Lakers before the time of the game, after the start of this week.
“I don’t need to play a game of legal time just to be ready at my current level of work,” she says.
A crowd gathered at Atoa Trump in West Virginia, Canada YouTube
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting several public events tonight.
This is the first collection of five counts of President Trump for this coming week, including a short stay in nearby towns such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
When it was confirmed that the weight loss of the stone he had chosen to fill the gap in the Supreme Court, President Trump sent people to support our upcoming elections because the control of the Congress was likely to be suspended in the hands of the Republic in November.
How many people does President Trump make tonight in West Virginia and how can it be followed on the Internet?
President Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia. Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow President Trump's gathering on the Internet directly through YouTube.
Trup may discuss the arrest of Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to enter the Supreme Court, which has become an obstacle to the prosecution for a sudden action and waits for a week's silence to be seized by the FBI's Bureau of Investigation.
But the real reason for this gathering is to help the Republic get a little trouble in November for the elections.
As a result, President Trump's campaign organizers said that the five-day public meeting this week was "to encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to keep and expand the majority of the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The main importance of the program is the control of Congress and the president's initiative to speak to several states as soon as possible before entering the busy protest period," said President Trump's spokesman, who did not mention the name when talking to Reuters.
In Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening gathering is scheduled to take place, and the West Virginia Metro News can train supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and help journalists from Pittsburgh," says West Virginia.
This is the second day of Atoa Trump's visit to West Virginia last month, a state that won over 40 percent between 2016 and 2016.
Trump's goal is to help Aunt Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate as Head of the West Virginia, who is willing to consider the simple investigation.
"It's not good for Morrisey to see the president who has to try to force him to raise his number of opinions," says Reuters's West Virginia University scientist Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team showed that he has the power to fight won't be sad if he's facing a private war on Sunday
After these three games, Ryder Cup may be the most popular game on Saturday afternoon.
The claim that sports is a nuisance is a simple idea now, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions.
Who, then, is to blame for this?
"They've had six benefits here, but now four others, it's probably ours that we're getting a little trouble," Jordan Spieth said before he started the world on a small run.
Of course, Europe has its advantage, leads to four numbers and has two-half to ten to fight.
The Americans, according to Spieth, seem to feel that there are only a few noises that help their teams and many reasons for their encouragement, especially the goals of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played the world together and received three to four numbers.
Spieth's play from the tea to the green and even shows the good example.
The sound of his party's praise was still strong according to the progress of his role, so he killed a big pott and won the clear victory in the fourth game so that he and Thomas both did not have enough after the two rounds.
It was only after they received the beat that they had won at the 15th floor that the U.S. team was not even worth it.
"It's necessary to have an argument and not work on your own," Spieth said.
The rest of them have two players today.
His name is listed 18 times.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players with numbers more than Spieth and Thomas in two days, which is the story of Ryder Cup.
They have four numbers in four games that seem incompatible but deadly from Europe, and they don't seem to lose any more.
Only "Molywood" were two people who didn't shoot a blog on Saturday afternoon, but they also left their blog on Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon and the morning's back on Friday.
What they are trying to do, and seeing their energies seem to fall from these proud viewers, seems to confirm that they are the players who need material on Sunday, and there will be no more players than Fleetwood or Molinari can reverse the victory for Europe if the Le Golf National is bright.
If they were good at first, they'd stick it together but at each other's lengths.
However, the European victory is still far ahead.
Bugba Watson and Webb Simpson were always behind Sergio Garcia, the king of fourballs in the morning, with Alex Noren.
One blog and two doubles in front of the issue were alarmed by Spanish and Swedish and in a short distance.
When Sunday, however, no one can expect to turn you away from worship.
It is very interesting to look at the furballs and fursomes close to cooperation between two players, the advice he gives, the advice he does not say, and how the strategy can change in the eye again.
To date, the team of Europe has a good game and they have a significant advantage when it comes to the last day but this game also shows that they have the power to fight the USA team despite some of the concerns, including those in the United States.
Europe leads to number 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a good advantage when it comes to the last day of the fight against Ryder Cup when it won the US 10-6 after the fourballs and foursomes game this evening.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, a full-time news player, led by two victorys that hit Tiger Woods, thus increasing its number four in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who was planning to keep their standard salary in Hazeltine two years ago, did not allow the U.S. to find out what happened in the morning during the fourballs, leading 3-1 in the race.
The Americans were more opposed during the forums, winning two games, but they were not able to reduce their anger.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to keep its ranks, he needs eight numbers during the 12-day private games.
Fleetwood was the first European girl to get four drawbacks, if she and Molinari were alone, people called "Molliwood" after the weekend of the surprises, the two people who got four in the four-digit game in the history of Ryder Cup.
When they put Woods and Patrick Reed on the Foreballs, they appeared in a fine way to defeat the already buried Woods and American girl Bryson Dechambeau at a more intense rate of 5&4.
Woods, who was very busy during the two games on Saturdays, seems to have been in a hurry at times, but he has played forballs and 19 forsomes in 29 which he has been beaten and he has lost seven times.
When Justin Rose took his life for the fourballs in the morning, he returned with Henrik Stanson during the races and won 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third world number.
Not all of what Europe did was wrong, even though the days in the south of Paris were pleasant and full of dreams.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who has already received the third major prize, set the target for the Americans on two counts on Saturdays.
They were able to win 2&1 victorys from Spain from Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and they returned and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy at 4&3 in the forums even though they lost the first two columns.
In the history of Ryder Cup, there were two teams from the beginning of a four-digit game, even if it was a war game enough for Furyk's team to keep their ranks.
Although they held the second place for two days, they did not seem to have the answers to the war on Sunday.
'Santria' in North Korea to destroy their weapons alone if there's no confidence
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that if the penalty continues, her confidence in the United States will be reduced and that it is the country's duty to agree to win their own nuclear weapons if that is the case.
Atua Ri Yong Go announced the annual meeting that North Korea has adopted a "great order of killings" over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile fires, the destruction of nuclear testing sites, and the provision of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we can't see what his strategy is against it from the United States," he said.
"If we can't trust the United States, we will never trust our country's protection, so it's our only decision to destroy our first weapon."
Although North Korea's complaints about Washington's aggression have been repeated by Atoa Ri's "step" method of working for the production of nuclear weapons that will reward North Korea each step, the statement he made seems strange because he has no longer rejected the release of uncontrolled nuclear weapons, such as Pyongyang's custom.
The announcement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the US President-in-Office of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised that he would try to put the nuclear weapons in the Korean Peace, while President Trump promised to secure North Korea's protection.
North Korea sought a way to officially end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first agree to withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to accept the call for a strong international picture of North Korea.
"The United States is still singing for "the destruction of the former nuclear weapons" and has just increased the pressure of punishments to set its goal in the repression, as long as opposition to the "war resolution" is rejected," says Ri.
"The idea that punishment would harm us meant that people don't know us.
The problem is that according to the level of punishments, our uncertainty is growing."
Atoa Ri never had a discussion about the second summit between Atoa Kim and Trump as the US President pointed out to the United Nations in the beginning of the week.
The Minister's award was a three-day meeting with the President of South Korea Maon Jae-in in five months, and he added: "If South Korea is not talking about the production of nuclear weapons in the United States, the production of nuclear weapons in Korean Peace will not be like this."
However, how to speak about Atoa Ri in his speech compared to the past year, when he told the United Nations Conference that the US's determination to fuseés from North Korea was no longer unique after the "bad Fiscal" Tromp of Kim's "homme-fusée" called the death of the United Nations.
While President Trump met with the United Nations this year, who warned North Korea that last year's "completely rehabilitated" had praised Kim for our ability to take action to eliminate weapons, but he said that there was still much work to be expected and that the punishment would not be held until the Koreans were released from nuclear weapons in it.
Last Wednesday said that she had no clear date to do so, she said, "Maybe two years, three or five months is necessary – no reason to believe it."
China and Russia said Pyongyang's UN Security Council should respond positively to its progress.
However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed the UN Security Council on Thursday stated: "The application of the sanctions announced by the Security Council to us for the complete, complete, and capable of identifying nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has been fully united in order to try to increase funding for nuclear and ballistic programs in Pyongyang since 2006.
During the United Nations Conference he met at Atoa Ri Atoa Pompeo and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again in the upper month to prepare for the second summit.
Three of them had visited North Korea this year, but their last visit was not very successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that the discussion had progressed, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "a request similar to that of a Jew."
When North Koreans met with Moon this month, they said that they would destroy the location of Missile and nuclear power plant if the United States seemed to take "comparably."
She told Kim that her "competitive arrangements" was the security security promised by the Tromp Tower in Singapore and that her relationship with Washington was to be restored.
Students at Harvard are learning about a lot of freedom
In a new lesson given to high school students at Harvard University this year, students increase their vision to try to fight the culture of self-inflictism through the "night" education through caffeine.
One researcher found that students at this world's top university are often unaware of what standard they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a medical doctor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created this lesson, which is probably not yet available in the United States.
She looked into creating the lesson after giving a presentation on the impact of the lack of vision on the study method.
'After the talk, a girl approached and said, 'Why have you been telling me that, in the third year?'
No one has ever told him how important it is – and it's amazing to him," he said to The Telegraph.
In this lesson, which has just started this year, students will be able to explain to their students the basic knowledge of the well-known frequency of tourism that contributes to learning and sports, and improves life in general.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Tale of the university's health office, said that the university decided to introduce the lesson when it found that students had not had enough sleep during the week.
An hour - long study is one of the most encouraging lessons we can learn.
In part, there is a picture of the student's room, students need to review the images of coffee cupcakes, coffee shops, trainers and books and inform them of the consequences of caffeine, light and the effects of the lack of transparency in sports, and eventually the frequency of the tourism is important.
On the other hand, participants are accused of causing loss of blood, loss of blood, loss of memory, and loss of vision loss over a long period of time.
Then there is a picture of the classroom, a small icon with a link, which encourages participants to consider the majority of the day.
'We know it will not change the student's way of life
But we believe that they have the right to know that – there is nothing else in your right to know the impact of smoking on health," Professor Czeisler said.
The frequency of pride is still there when it becomes 'nightly news', and it adds that the result of modern technology and non-increasing pressure on students has become a problem that does not increase the effectiveness of the trumpet.
To make sure that the actual temperature is sufficient, and that you have a good quality temperature, it should be a 'secret weapon' that students should use to fight stress, fatigue and pain, he says – yes, even to prevent the weather from falling, since the non-terrorist’s ability to say to the mind that it is normal, but keeps alive.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old man from California who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler organize the study, as he had attended one of his studies last year in Harvard during the first year.
This lesson opened her eyes and encouraged her to do what she could for a whole school.
He hopes that the next step is to move the fourth-year student to a similar school program before entering the competition area.
According to Professor Czeisler's advice, students should hear a call for hours of communication and relaxation, and be warned of the consequences of the 'red iron' output of the electronic display and LED lights, which may seriously disrupt the interaction of the body’s body temperature and body course, and may cause problems with the vision.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gerrard's people are dead by Menga's Balloon · Global Voices
Rangers himself suffered the loss of citylessness and the team of Steven Gerard who seemed unable to play with him in Livingston, as a result of Dolly Menga's death.
The Ibrox team hoped that the first victory would take place outside the city from the major 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in September, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard a second defeat in the 18th game that the leader held, and his team became eight in front of the Hearts team, leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga died seven minutes before the explosion, and the Rangers team in the field seemed to have never seen an idea and were not expected to escape.
The Rangers, Livingston, has now turned into a number of frauds, but only in the third place and Hibernian is in front of the dead police station.
And the danger to Rangers may not remain behind after the damage to the head of Calum Spence, a playmate in the field, if something outside the camp seems to have to be healed first.
Gerard's shift from his team was eight, which separated from Ayr and included in the half-way process for Bethfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt did not change the 11th Live received a number from Hearts last week and he may have been happy to see his team that was already well-programming against opponents every day of the day.
The Rangers may have sold the ball, but Livingston knew how to use the ball that had passed it.
They should have died two minutes after the game started, as Menga made the first offer from her and saw Scott Pittman next to Allan McGregor's pocket, but the football played by the middle player was far away.
After that, Keaghan Jacobs refused a cup-franc and saw Craig Halket's profile but his friend Alan Lithgow's address was transferred to a far-reaching trap.
The game is only controlled by Rangers but it seems more likely to be more than confidence in how they play in the last three hours.
Alfredo Morelos was very convinced that he should get a penance if he and Steven Lawless argued in the fourteenth minute, but Judge Steven Thomson had just forced the Colombians and his complaint to leave.
There were only two cases of cancer from the Rangers during the first time but many times when there was a disaster involving Liam Kelly, a former Ibrox security guard, saw the services from Lassana Coulibaly’s head and the weak case from Ovie Ejaria.
It may be true that the first shot of Livi's death in 34 minutes is not the result of a good game, but everyone agrees that it is worth it because of its creative ability.
The Rangers did not just meet Jacobs' violent game again.
Scott Arfield didn't act when Declan Gallagher offered Scott Robinson the ball, but then he didn't panic when he was looking for Menga, who killed the ball in a simple way.
Gerrard made a slight change when he moved to Coulibaly, and it was almost fair for a player because Morelos was trapped in the field, but Kelly was running out of his spot and stopped him.
Livingston has continued to cut these foreign teams into his favorite game, so the exits from Lithgow and Halket have not stopped.
The Holt team has only been able to help its number in the last minute but McGregor's position was good enough to prevent Jacobs, before the footballer from Lithgow's mouth to avoid the noise.
Glenn Middleton, the replacement of Rangers, also asked for a penalty if he was separated from Jacobs, but Thomson didn't mean to look at him either.
Saturday: Geiger Counter's Creator · Global Voices
So once again, the page from our Almanac "Alahady Marina": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and MBOLA MITOHY ... was born in Germany on that day, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who later became a musician.
Geiger developed a method of radioactivity testing and control, which later produced the Geiger Counter device.
So far, Geiger Counter has become a science-dependent tool, and then it has become a pop-cool-based tool, as seen in a film entitled "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, found by scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Men say, "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter, used in the past to search for radioactive waste, such as uranium.
When you include these hearings, you are very aware of the effects of atoms beyond radioactivity in the rock."
Evans: "Oh, he's really worried now!"
"Hans" Geiger, only a few days before his 63th year of life.
But the creation of his name still exists.
A new box for healing may be able to teach the "visit" protection force that the cell is sick
His new box for healing could teach the 'to see' security forces that are sick and kill them.
In the medical process, this box is taught to identify the cell of the immune system.
In this way the cell cuts from the disease are included, a little change in the lungs
They then ‘see’ a protein found in various forms of medicine, then re-entered into the body.
There was an early vaccine that had a life-threatening effect on a number of patients who had different health problems.
When a woman was treated with this vaccine, her vaccine, which teaches the ability to detect the disease cell, lost her baby home for more than 18 months.
In the process, healthy cells are removed from the patient, an adjustment in the lungs to "see" the protein called HER2 along with several treatments, and then the cells are re-entered into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "If we look at the results we can see, this vaccine is a real hope."
HER2 is "the growth of many kinds of peace," including the growth of dreams, homes, flowers and plants, explains Professor Berzofsky.
There is a process similar to this health clinic in the patient's clinic, "teached" to focus on the healing cells, which have been found in a type of leukemia treatment.
Kaneye West gave his public talk in support of Trump, and MAGA tweeted, after he spoke on SNL.
It's the last one
Viewer Kanye West was created in a video recording room during the Saturday Night Live program when American President Donald Trump spoke out in a long fight and said he was going to vote in 2020.
After his third song for the night, the title Ghost Town, which he had played in a small boxing Mace America Great, he gave a long speech against democracy and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people, they say, "How do you love Trump, a man who's a blacksmith?"
If I have a problem with racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he says.
At the beginning of the SNL program, a brief funny story was seen by Matt Damon, the star of Hollywood, defending his stand as a witness to the House of Lord Brett Kavanaugh before the House of Justice, about the protest by Mr. Christine Blasey Ford to act in a way that was wrong.
Although it has not been published during the program, the singer Chris Rock has published the image file containing this long speech by West on the social network.
It's not clear whether Rock's aim is to attract West when he published that picture.
West also complained to the viewer that he was deeply hurt by the damage he had done.
"They hurt me behind the stairs.
They say, 'Don't do that shit when you get out of the platform.'
They hurt me!
And they say I have a hard place now," he says, according to the Washington Examiner report.
West continued: "You will find this difficult place?" he said, "I will make Superman's escape route, because that means you can't command me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try love."
At least two times, viewers have raised what they said and found that SNL’s suppliers seem to be embarrassed, says the News, and someone said to the newspaper: "One house has not spoken."
The last minute West was invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, a former friend of Mac Miller, the rap singer who had died a few days earlier.
The way West singed the song I Love It, and dressed like the Perrier flag.
West received the support of the TPUSA team manager, Candace Turner, who said on Twitter: "For the most courageous person: DEVELOPMENT OF THE FATHER."
But Karen Hunter, a talent-shower, also told Twitter that "that he is West is very happy to do."
"But the TSY chose to support people (to buy their clothes or songs out, or to support "the art") when I saw that I was talking and discussing, which I thought, damaging society.
He can do what he wants.
We are also," he said.
The rapist, before the show, said on Twitter that he changed his name and "he is now the official name of Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name, but follows Diddy who is known as Puff Daddy, or Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapist, Snoop Dogg, once named Snoop Lion, also known as Prince, changed his name to make it known.
There was a target of killing people near the restaurant Belfast
There was a wounded man in the east of the Belfast restaurant in the garden, and a 45-year-old man threatened to kill him.
It was the Ballyhackmore word for it, says the police.
The man will rise to trial in Belfast on Sunday.
The public ministry will examine the matter.
Kit Harington, the famous actor of the Game of Thrones, in his play
Jon Snow is the best known figure in Kit Harington, where he uses arrows in the story that follows Game of Thrones, a history of violence in the past.
The film player, aged 31, showed that even a violent person does not know how to act, saying that this is why young man thinks he needs violence and power before people respect him.
Kit said on Sunday Times Culture that "there's something wrong with it," she wondered how a man could help a man get away from the disturbing situation that had taken place during the time of #MeToo.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, a woman who played with her in the game of Thrones, who was also 31 years old. She said "will be willing" to help solve the problem.
‘I wonder why we have become wrong about men now?’ he said.
‘What did they teach boys when they grew up, causing us to see this problem now?’
Kit believes that television is part of the way people have wrong attitudes about men when they watch the role of men in movies.
And she continues: ‘What are men like, and what have they been taught?
What is being taught on TV, and boys see on the street that makes them think they have to do this if they want to become a real man?
Perhaps this is one of the main questions we should answer: How can we change this?
But there is a real problem with men.'
He said in the survey that when the game of Throne is completed next year, he will no longer play to make his jokes or add a little more, but he can say ‘wars and arguments’.
Kit will start playing a new movie next November, Sam Shepard's True West, talking about a man who's a movie producer and his brother who's a thief.
She said she met Rose, her husband, among the best things she had to play with the Game of Thrones.
‘This film was what I saw my husband, and that is why I got a family and started my life,’ he said.
Rose, the woman interested in Kit's role when she played the role of Jon Snow, during Emmy avard-winning.
They were married in the country of Leslie's family in Scotland this June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of people said they had a disease in China
China said there was a 14% increase in HIV-infected people.
More than 820,000 people are affected by it in the country, health officials say.
From May to July 2018 alone, it has been reported that it has killed 40,000 people.
Most of them were sexually transmitted by the disease, but they never did.
Blood transfusions have greatly contributed to the disease in some parts of China, in the past.
However, HIV victims are almost gone, says health officials in China, during a meeting in Yunnan.
In the year, however, more than 100,000 people were infected with HIV and AIDS in China
The spread of HIV through sex is a major problem for men and women in China.
Both men and women in China have also been legally recognized since 1997, but they are still very different from people.
In view of the culture in the country, a survey conducted found that between 70 and 90 percent of men sex with men marry women.
The protection of these sexes is not enough, so the disease spreads.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has accepted the use of HIV from other countries to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP workers haven't issued the senator's secrets and says there's a "very dangerous liar" in "one project"
American Maxine Waters, said on Saturday that some people working there were justified and said they published a record of nine United States senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles also insist that these secrets were published by right-wing and web users who reject the notion of "right-end".
"It's a lie, a lie and the most disgusting lie," said Waters, in what was shared on Twitter.
Private addresses and phone numbers in the United States are said to be included in the publications. The owner of Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
These details were published on the Internet on Sunday, and the person who sent them was unknown. However, it was known that the case had occurred during a Senate meeting in Capitol Hill, where a united complaint about Brett Kavanaugh's regime, which sought to be elected in the Supreme Court.
A brief explanation was published after the three senators investigated Kavanaugh.
Websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP address sent the message was from the Waters office, and published information about the Water staff, says The Hill.
"There's no evidence and it's completely fake," said Waters.
"The people who work with me - who have been kept secret about them after these patterns - have never published an explanation.
There's no evidence and it's completely fake."
What he said on the Internet has made people even more critical of Waters, especially Maison Blanche, and Fleischer journalist.
"He's worried about his departure," Fleischer said.
"It is clear that he does not have the quality needed to be part of the Congress.
A person should not be angry if he is deserved but has not done so.
They should not be quick to take offense.
He should not be concerned about why the person has made it a joke.
He should be warm and peaceful."
Fleischer compared the behavior of Waters with the criticism of democracy on the Kavanaugh case, and the criticism he received because he was very angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a electorate from the republican party, also commented on Twitter, which aims to bring Waters' place to the election.
"It's really big if it's true," he said
Rtoa Waters said his office announced "the business authorities and the authorities who take care of the law because of these restrictions."
"We do what we can to see the perpetrators," he said, "and they will be punished by law for the crimes they have spread about the people who are working with me."
Johnny English – Activist Rowan Atkinson’s funny game
People have become accustomed to thinking that they have a back-up idea that always shows Brexit which has an English player movie, and that is what happened to Johnny English-, who first appeared in 2003, took his title, Johnny English, and his 2011 titled Johnny English Reborn.
Will we laugh only if people really do something about us and try to make a move?
However, we know that Johnny English, who is both a joke and a joke, has renewed his commitment to doing the job, and the funny films made for English-speaking people are the best way to get to know him.
She's an unskilled dancer, and she thinks she's very beautiful, but she's only going to leave Clouseau, and there's some part to see her as Mr. Bean. She did something special with the opening song of Charlotte du feu that was released in London's Olympic Games in 2012.
The role of this player was taken as from the film about Atkinson, who is far away from the world. The film was posted on Barclaycards TV, but is now unknown.
There's one or two nice things about this JE to come out soon.
I'd like to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter and wearing an old military suit, and the helicopter's seat is on his side.
Even though Atkinson's appearance is just funny, it's not funny and it's like the movie was just forced to make fun, even though the music is actually done in "strong" movies such as 007 and the Mission impossible.
It's like it's done to make fun of children rather than adults. I think it's not much better than the funny movie she did as a Bean she was, Johnny English.
But as far as the past is concerned, Great Britain has a serious problem.
There were netizens who used people to see the British network, knowing who the British spy was, who was disappointed by the police working at the time – a small part played by Kevin Eldon.
This led a lot of history for the public-known prime minister, but no longer has any supporters. Emma Thompson tried to do what she could when Teresa May's role was played, but nothing she played too much.
He was informed by his employer that he had been aware of all about their clients, so he had to become an employer no longer.
And it was done to make Johnny English proud, who became a teacher at school for wealthy people, and to train him to become a poet: funny story, because England made him like a school of fiction.
English once went to Whitehall and saw former friends, Bough, the role played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already married and is working for people in the sea, who are a woman who shows respect: part played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are going back to work together, and they will do things that are wrong when they attack the Girl Rider, and meet with Ophelia Bulletova, the game of Olga Kurylenko, a beautiful and powerful girl.
During that time, however, the prime minister was arrested when a man who was growing rich and able to solve the problem of the Internet spy, not that of Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough's work began with this. They made a meal for the hotel, and sold a French hotel. They found problems when they went to Volta's party. And English led a problem when they learned to use a casque that gave her a mental picture of Volta's house.
We will still see on the next side of the story. Although it is fun and fun, there is a television program for children to do so.
It's just a long time ago.
When I saw this movie, Johnny English, I thought: Atkinson should be a part of the English film when he's playing it.
The workers refused to set up a battle party to join the British four days a week but to get a five-day crew.
Jeremy Corbyn's party plans to implement the project to make Britain work for four days a week but to have five people working for five days.
The union said that employers should transfer the funds allocated to the development of technology by providing them with extra days.
It will take three days without work at the end of the week, but it will last forever.
The source says that the idea would be consistent with the value of the syndices so that the workers would be better off.
The Congress of Trade Unions agreed to allow workers to work only four days a week so that they can benefit from economic change.
A longtime member of The Sunday Times' Trade Union said: "The announcement of new governance is expected before the end of the year.
‘It will not apply to night workers but the requirement may be valid, where only four days a week work, to bring together the trade union on economic terms and to give the employees and industrial strategies on a weekly basis.’
Not only did the Workers' Union have this opinion, but the Black Party also promised that it would work only four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, the request has not yet been submitted by the Trade Union.
One employee's representative said: "It's not a one-way management system that works only four days a week and that's not really examined by the union."
Chancellier John McDonnell attended a conference on work last week to explain how he saw the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was willing to join the "indirect sales" and the "excellent profits" in the private companies.
Chancellier's project at work also means that employees of water-producing companies may not be able to recover all the money they have spent because the country's prices may be reduced if there are only a few negative actions.
He has also set up a plan to set up a clear location for the company's employees and to open up a Full Fund for the Foundation to provide a similar regime for employees with up to 10 percent of the company's employees, which includes more than 500 £.
"60 minutes" said Lindsey Graham, and John Kennedy to be able to change the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh
At last week's latest, the latest election on the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanugh in his Supreme Court, the FBI's investigation of his charges, and asked whether the Bureau's findings could have moved the Republican senators to stop supporting him.
In an interview this Sunday, "60 minutes", journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could do to change their mind.
Kennedy spoke more about his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course it is," I mean Kennedy.
"I will come from the court," I told him, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, published the statement, and then said, ‘ Did I do that?’
He's decided, ready, not guilty."
But Graham's choice was not ignored.
"It doesn't change my mind if it's in Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to be with heavy charges," he says.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it's like, "Brett's got it," helped Graham, talking to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he named could not confirm that.
36 years ago.
I don't see any news and changes."
What is the Human Rights of the People, and what has been the result of the Poverty Reduction?
Next Saturday, New York will receive the Public Day, an annual music event that will find many artists to play and sing; it will reduce world poverty.
In his seventh year, the National Council of Human Rights will find more than ten people in the central park, not only to be happy to watch a show like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to compete for a real-purpose movement to eradicate poverty in 2030.
The 2012 Human Rights Council is an international debate that is expected to end poverty by increasing the number of people participating in the war.
In order to get the short-term package to meet the event (if you cannot afford to buy a VIP package), viewers need to do a number of things, or act as a voluntary move, informing world leaders, making a phone call or other way of helping the campaign to achieve its goal is fighting poverty.
But why has the world's citizens been successful in 12 years to set their goals?
Is it really a good way to give people a peaceful package to convince them to support the call for action, or just the call "clictivism" - people feel the difference when writing names for online demand and simply sending calls?
Since 2011, citizens have said that he has been working at almost 19 million of his supporters, which has moved him to pursue another goal.
These work has been said to have helped many world leaders to negotiate and raise nearly $37 million in order to save the lives of more than 2.25 million people from 2030.
In early 2018, the group signed a contract and a statement of 390, showing the results of its work, at least $10 billion had already passed and returned.
The group concluded that the financial assistance had directly affected some 649 million people around the world.
Among the inclusion of the Food Chain Agreement (The Power of Nutrition) was agreed to work with English money changers and executives to "help children grow up legally", and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help fight malnutrition when more than 4700 citizens received a voice of acceptance.
"With the support of the English government, volunteers, the government, and national people like you, we will be able to put "the suffering caused by malnutrition" as a sign below the historical page, says The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman of the people during his show in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 U.K. efforts to improve the food for mothers and children, the government said it would provide money for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which would help more than 5 million mothers and children in food.
The answer to the question on its website will be "Why do you believe we can always end poverty?"
Most citizens replied: This is a difficult road - sometimes we may get down, maybe not going to succeed.
However, like the conflicts and protests that have fought against our former ethnic differences, we will win because it is stronger when we get married.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, is one of those who will participate in this year's event in New York, sponsored by Deborra- Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States has been able to use the marine army as a "stop" in order not to be able to transfer energy - Foreign Secretary
"If necessary", Washington can call on the seabed to prevent Russia's energy from spreading in the market, including in the Middle East, as US Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to Washington.
Zinke stated that Russia's agreement with Syria - as noted, which took place during the campaign of the legal governments - is just a way to build a new energy market.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to give up energy just as they did in Europe, the wealth of southern Europe," he says.
And, as the honourable man said, there is a good way to get rid of it.
"The U.S. can do this, with the marine army, to make sure that sea transport is open and even if it is necessary to force it so that they can't get out of the market," he said.
Zinke invited the participants to come to the United States, an independent organization that maintains the "Employment Voice".
He went to compare Washington's design with his dealings with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are the same if the truth is true.
"The economic choice, either Iran or Russia, is possible, with financial support and oil supply, he says, and compared Russia with "a sugar-based olive oil" with a low oil economy.
The announcement came when Trump's delegation was still busy contributing to the movement of natural gas water in Europe, instead of Russia, the longer it is for European buyers.
Therefore, President Donald Trump himself has won Germany's approval by the authorities of Trump's regime to withdraw from the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the capital of Moscow."
Moscow has confirmed that the 2-billion-dollar North Stream fans, designed to increase the capacity of already working as 110 billion cubic metres, are a clean economic project.
The Kremlin explained that the ongoing opposition of Washington to the project is only for economic reasons and is a bad example of the conflict with injustice.
"I believe that we all agree that we should not use energy-pressure tools and that customers should be able to choose who they like," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with the American Energy Management Secretary of Moscow in September.
The U.S. headquarters has caused Germany to return and strengthen its commitment to the project.
The leader of German industrial organizations, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the Americans not to rely on the European Union's leadership on the two agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a big problem when a third state was struggling with the power supply in us," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren spoke of Massachusetts's 20th Senate as "responsively Focused" on the move as president in 2020
Massachussets Elizabeth Warren's Senate said that the move to the next presidential election was "responsively focused".
During the Holyoke Massachusetts meeting, Warren spoke about his needs.

"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump will do about our democracy.
Warren is already well known for calling Trump and the politician at Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Warrren quoted a Friday call saying "It's obvious that we need the FBI's investigation before the elections."
However, a survey carried out on Thursday showed that most members with Warren refused to leave in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the "secure" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk/ Boston Globe pool.
Two-thirds of them agree to their request.
The survey showed that many support from former Governor Deval Patrick, supported by 38 percent and 48 percent did not.
Many other democratic dignitaries have argued that President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders might compete with them in 2020.
Biden said he would say his decision in January as reported by the Journalist Association.

Track Palin, 26 years old, went to Iraq a year after he entered the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with committing crimes in the homes that Sunday night.
"All that my child has lost, he will still be able to tell me, I can tell the family who remembers the pain of torture and some of the wounds of our army returned from the war," he said to the audience during Trump's campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

It would be a disappointment to try to save an instant in Palu if the deaths were twice as high as they were trying to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was bad.
"Very hard,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who comforted her daughter when she was born in the city of Palu.

The Tromp's claim that Beijing has blocked the American election notes what the U.S. authorities have said to Reuters: a new step towards developing Washington's campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for the foreign government to place a market to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting the trade in the same rights as the transfer.
China's campaign at the beginning of the war was designed to attack developing countries like Iowa that supported the Republican Tromp Party, says Chinese and American scientists.
Terry Branstad, former U.S. ambassador to China and former government in Iowa, a major company on the consequences of the production in China, said Beijing was injured by workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
In an article published in the newspaper Des Moines on Sunday, Branstad wrote to China: "The threat of the moment is increasing twice as high as the advertising of the press.
"With the launch of its campaign, the Chinese government uses the popular tradition for freedom of speech and freedom of the media by putting money-sharing documents on the list of Des Moines, according to Branstad.
"On the other hand, in Beijing's newspaper, you will find the number of unlimited opponents and you will not find a reliable opinion of the Chinese people about the economic crisis in China, to be severely controlled. The Chinese Communist Party, as it is written, "
He also said that "one of the most popular newspapers in China rejected the post's release offer," even though he did not directly mention the newspaper.
Observers warned the Republic of Aborigines against voters nine years ago with the Kavanaugh case
Many Republicans support and protect electoral candidates to the Britt Kavanaugh tribunal, in front of many reports of sexual violence, warned one researcher that they will show a strong influence, especially on women, during the upcoming elections.
The outcome of this situation is very strong and most of the Republicans have already announced that they want to vote later.
Grant Reeher, a political science teacher at Maxwell School, University of Syracuse, gave confidence in The Hill an article published on Saturday.
Reeher suspects that the voter's anger will increase the efforts of Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in the last minute for the FBI investigation
"The women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and even November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the country's secretary and spokesman, according to the Washington newspaper, DC
In the morning, protestors called "We will come in November!" as they pointed out in the law of the National Assembly when the Republic chose to grant Kavanaugh's appointment to the judicial committee, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The hatred of democracy and the reason for democracy will not be included in the bill," said Stu Rothenberg, a political investigator without a supporter at the news site.
"People say it's getting bigger; and it's true.
But it may be even higher, especially for voters from abroad and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, although the president does not like them, they often do not.
Even before Ford's testimony was filed in his complaint to the Supreme Court for sexual abuse, the prosecutor announced that the answer could be disclosed if the Republic continued with the arrest.
"It was a shock to the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the National Committee of the former republics, at the beginning of the week, according to the NBC News.
"Not only the election of the committee or the last election, nor the establishment of Kavanaugh, but also the way the Republican has done and how it has carried it, "Guy Cecil, head of the US Priorities, a group supporting the elected democracy, said on television.
However, the Americans seem to have two sides who should believe the testimony but Ford is more religious than Kavanaugh
The YouGov survey found that 41% of the respondents believed fully or did not believe in the testimony Ford, while 35% said that Kavanaugh did not believe.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied to him as a witness, 30% said Ford was the same.
After Flake's release, the FBI is investigating Ford's charges and other accused, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford stood up as a witness before the Senate Justice Committee during his last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him at the age of 17.
Ramirez announced that the High Court's candidate showed his training during his party's studies in Yale in 1980.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet used on Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, made his initiative to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of everyone on technology, Inrupt, is an open-source company of Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose where to store stored files and who can log in to the notification.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the "Inrupt" goal was "the world's government."
"We must do this now," he said to the new company.
"This is a unique opportunity."
The program uses traditional technologies to enable people to create "special tools on the Internet" or POD for themselves.
There may be a list of connectors, list of things done, albums, music lists and other special and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, there are only one "navigator" and at the same time.
The unique feature of the website is that users have access to the type of source.
The company's demand is "to give special attention by means of data."
According to general company John Bruce, the goal of Inrupt is to provide the source of power, expertise and expertise to make it possible for everyone.
The company is currently the Berners-Lee company, Bruce, in a security area purchased by IBM, has been contacted by volunteers working on projects and communities.
Since this week, technology users around the world can create applications for themselves using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking about "Facebook and Google" to make a complete change that will completely change the model of his business here.
"We do not ask permission from them."
In an article on Medium released on Saturday, Berners-Lee said that "the intention is to provide economic and environmental energy to protect the dignity and quality of the new news sites."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has participated in the debate on the absence of the Internet.
Despite the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, building the website and Open Data Institute.
"I look forward to this new time of the site," says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria's First Great War Square Celebrates · Global Voices
The only religious leaders in the Church of England received Victoria's second prize during the First Great War as warriors were celebrated in the city that was born 100 years later.
The Royal Lietna The Riverend Bernard Vann received a prize on September 29, 1918 against Bellenglis and Lehacourt.
He didn't even know he had a reputation from the British army but was killed four days later by a skilled shooter.
There was a sign that her two boys showed during the night, in Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, among his children, said the reason for the 100 years after the war that his father had really known was "a great idea."
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his army on the canal Saint-Quentin, in the "crazy storm and bombing across the battlefield", on September 29, 1918.
Then he went to the fireplace, and in "the most extraordinary and respectful way" he led his group to the front, and then he himself shot and killed three people from the enemy group.
A German trained bomber killed Colonel Vann on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his father's "will never be able to imitate" what he did, and that makes him "self-esteem."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also raised respect for the flag, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very happy to take part in the ghost," and he also said that "a person needs a lot of support."
MMA supporters reported to see Bellator 206; but Peppa Pig appeared again
Imagine that you were busy and enjoyed watching Bellator 206, but then you won't let the program look like it.
There were 13 conflicts in San Jose's program, and six of them were very interesting, and were sent all night to the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But at six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight that, British observers were shocked and surprised because the program was immediately transformed into Peppa Pig.
Some are surprised that they have already gone out to watch the game.
One viewer said on Twitter that the picture was "simply but unsatisfied" for children.
"As for the law of the state, the program should not be launched at 6 o'clock in the morning. It must be replaced by a program for children," says Dave Schwartz, founder of Bellator's marketing and communication.
"Peppa the Pig," ie."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he will interview British viewers during the next schedule.
Coker said he "thinks he's going to go back to that," and "he's looking for a solution."
"But the day is already six o'clock in the morning, so we can't solve the problem unless Sunday comes, at our own time.
But we are looking for solutions.
We feel that there are so many shared messages, and most of those who wrote them are not happy.
We're trying to fix the problem. We thought it was a technical problem,
Or the state of affairs.
We promise that the following examples will no longer happen.
We're going to reduce the number five, but it's not going to be six. We're already doing the same thing, but we're trying to make the viewer happy, and it's getting bigger.
It is also very sad."
Desert Island: Tom Daley thought himself "low" than others
The Olympics, Tom Daley, said that he felt "lower" than others when he laughed, because he loved men, but that made him determined to succeed.
The young man, who was 24 years old, said that he had been in high school before he heard that "there was no one like him."
She commented on the program presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4 Desert, saying that people who love men or women also have the right, and she wants to give others a "hope" for them.
He also said that when he was a child, it was no longer important for him to win the Olympics.
The program provider, Kirsty Young, had been unemployed for months because of illness.
As if Daley was a ship's reader in his first program with Laverne, he said that he felt "low" compared to others when he grew up because "the community didn't accept this as a man who loves men, women who love women."
He says: “I have always felt inferior to others, but today it gives me strength and gives me a sense of success."
He wants to show people that he's "doing things", so people won't be disappointed when they know he loves men.
He got twice a medal and wanted to support LGBT. He showed in front of many people during the Commonwealth game in Australia this year, and he insisted that all countries should be free and that the presence of LGBT should not be banned.
She said she had a conversation because she knew she was a good girl. She was not accused of being allowed to go with a man, and she wanted to give others a "hope" too.
The third world official said he was a poet for a man, not the American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013. "I didn't mind."
Daley married the winner of Oscar in his 20 ’ s, and it's not a problem for him, he says, the difference of the year.
"When you're going to get a lot of things when you're young - she took part in the first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and her father died three years later - it's hard to see someone like you who's infected with what you've got."
She had two children in June, a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said she changed her "how she thinks and sees things."
"If I asked you a question last year, I would say, "I'll get the gold medal," he said.
"But you see, there's something more important than gold medals.
Robbie didn't beat me."
She died in her 40th year of 2011 when she was diagnosed with cancer.
Daley said his father never agreed to his death, and the last thing he asked was to get a ticket for London in 2012 because he wanted to live on the first number to see his son.
I couldn't say to him: "You won't look at me first."
"I held his hand when he was gone. When he was dead and I thought he might be dead," he said.
The following year, 2012, Daley took part in the Olympic Games and won the medal.
"That's what I've been dreaming since I was a child, that I'm going to dance in front of a lot of people and play the Olympics. I'm so happy," he says.
It also inspired him when he chose his song – Proud de Heather Small - which gave him strength during the preparation of the Olympics. He was still very afraid.

Mickelson was not allowed to participate in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will try to find the best he can on Sunday, when he will play the 47th game on Ryder Cup, but he has to try to predict what he has done so that it doesn't make him feel so bad for him.
Mickelson participated in the event every 12 years, but Captain Jim Furyk was kidnapped by the four footballers on Saturday.
Although many should be interested, such as in the United States, he went with the pom-pom girl all day, and tried to correct his mistakes.
It's not easy to lead, even though it's very popular. He's 48 years old but he's not allowed to play the Golf National, because if it's not possible to launch the ball, he's completely lost.
Although the place is difficult to play, it will compete with the famous British, Francesco Molinari, with the enemy game he will play on Sunday, which was with the team that won this week, which is not Tommy Fleetwood.
This game will be very important for Mickelson, especially if he is trying hard to start, as the American team has already lost half of the 12 simple games.
Furyk said that his players were so confident that he would not speak too much.
"He well knows how important what he is to do today. He took my shirt off, picked me up and said he was ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's very confident.
He was one of the most famous players in the Temple, and he has been helping his team ever since this week.
I never thought he would play again.
But I hoped he would play more than that, but we believe that this is what we should do.
He wants to be like everyone."
Mickelson will get more character than Nick Faldo at Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may be the last time he plays Ryder Cup, which will have the greatest character in all the games he has ever played.
Mickelson, a 20-year-old died and won 7 times, although Furyk said that his arrival had caused the team to lose its momentum.
"He smiles even though he's a deaf person, he's very smart, he likes to laugh, he's happy to have him in the team," she says.
"I believe he and the young in the team this week, it was a pleasure to see that.
He's not just playing but he's giving a lot."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows they might be missing.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that even though they are leading a little ahead of the games against two players on the last day of Ryder Cup, it can be easy to turn back to finish his move.
In 1997 the Dano was the first to play in Valderrama. The team of Seve Ballesteros then won over five American teams, but they only won 141⁄2-13 1⁄2.
"Keep in mind that we led to Valderrama, we led to Brooklyn, which we won, and to Valderrama which we won, but now," says Bjorn, in a photo, after seeing the Class of 2018 received 5-3 characters in the morning and evening, leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story of me and everyone on the team will show that it's not possible until now.
In the morning, you do your best.
Go up to the platform and do all you can to do the right thing.
Not yet, we are still looking for a sign on the table.
This is our goal: to get the start, which is what we focus on.
I've always said from the beginning that I really care about 12 players, but we also know that we are among the most experienced people around the world."
Bjorn enjoyed playing in the critical golf field, and he added: "I should not think I'm aware of this.
I don't think it's gonna happen tomorrow.
In the morning, each of us can play a game, and that becomes something else.
It's nice to play together when everything is all right, but when you're done alone, you're actually seeing your golf skills.
This is the message that needs to be delivered to the players, to give you the best from you tomorrow.
Don't think of your friend, but let him give his best."
But Furyk is not like Bjorn, because he wants each one of them to try to give the best of it, just like they did when they were with his friends.
Furyk was always at the end of the big days of these strange and confusing events, from the winning team in Brooklyn before he was released when Europe rejected the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember all the dancing in it," he explained how Ben Crenshaw, his captain in 1999, had killed the players on the final day of the game.
"There are 12 major games tomorrow, but you should be ready immediately to begin to be deeply touched by the example you have seen in Brooklyn, as you have seen in Medinah.
This silence, when faced with one another, puts a lot of pressure on the games they hope to play.
And we're going to go with all the kids we love, you see, we're doing great things tomorrow.
Thomas was trying to lead the game against Rory McCllroy in the most violent game, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, European members of his organization.
"I chose this group after this order because I think it will be possible for it to last," Bjorn explained his choice for two players' games.
The arrival of German new warships is still under way
The new German army ship should have arrived in 2014 to launch the warship on the day of the Cold War, but it will not have been there for at least a year for reasons of production and price growth according to the media report.
Using "Rheinland-Pfalz," the arrival of the lead ship in the Baden-Wuertemberg class was announced by military spokesman Die Zeit.
The ship should have been used in the marine army in 2014, but due to the problems of transporting it, the dead ship was damaged.
The four Soviet vessels to Baden-Wuertemberg returned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the types of Bremen that are already flying.
Of course, they will put a heavy burden on them, a variety of aircraft, ships, and technology pilots, such as a light, sound, and special monitors.
It is also part of the specialization of it for a long period of time, perhaps only to be able to publish these new ships on the beach in two years.
However, the subsequent warning means that the final landing vessels are thought to have been able to see Germany's strength in the sea again on a date before the use of it, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 vessel was released annually when the German Navy officially refused to use it and returned it to the port of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
First of all, the ship's crew returned the ship to its manufacturer.
It is not very clear why it was returned, but German media said that "a lack of social and physical integrity" did not permit the use of the ship of combatants in the course of peace.
The lack of data integrity is a major problem because 120 ships will lead the Baden-Wuertemberg crews less than the number of people carrying the former Bremen vessel.
In addition, it is clear that the ship was too busy and reduced its speed and reduced the specific changes made by the marine army.
It is believed that Germany's 7,000-year-old "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as its equivalent ships were used in the Second Great War.
In addition to economic uncertainty, the cost of a whole project has also become a problem, including the training of farmers in its rule.
It has been said that up to 3.1 billion euros (or 3.6 billion dollars), if it should initially be 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the newest ships have become particularly important in the wake of a recent warning that Germany's maritime forces are losing power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Security Committee, admitted that the ship "has no ship and enough ships."
The honourable man said that the problem was getting worse because the former vessels had not been used yet, but there was no new ship to replace them.
He even complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg ships could be used by the Navy.
National Trust recognizes the record of the lives of relatives
A new research conducted in the easternmost part of Scotland has been found on how the mother is doing when cooking on the city’s streets.
It is hoped that the only believing animal’s life - style will be clearer but the search will slow down and will help those who may be in a position to protect the future.
Scientific research at the National Trust in Scotland will focus on the "pipistrelles" seen and "soprano", while the daubenton's football club and sister Daubenton in Inverwe Gardens, Western Ross.
A special person will be sent to the place to record the actions and lives of relatives during the specified period.
NHS workers and several volunteers will also conduct free research using urban surveys.
Experts will then use the available recordings, including a friend's call, and also what he or she does or what he does.
There will be a photo of the funerals of relatives and reports to be made so that they can create a picture showing their behavior in rural areas.
Robert Dewar, an NTS psychologist and naturalist, hopes that the research answers will find out what kind of place the relatives really need and how they live in each other's lives.
This will help you to know the benefits of managing the habitats of these animals, such as the creation of a nest and how to maintain as much forest as possible for animals and similar animals.
It has been seen that over the centuries, it has been very hostile to the relatives of Scotland and Great Britain.
Large buildings and the kind of development work that damages their neighborhood and their communities are dangerous to them.
However, light and electric equipment can also be dangerous, such as paper and other chemical tools used for building equipment, and a stick that can be captured.
However, it is not a sign of weakness.
However, because he is an animal of prey at night, his shoes work better than his eyes when he grabs his ribs.
He uses a lot of technology and tools to clearly identify the insects he is dealing with and the problems that can catch him in the dark.
The NTS, responsible for more than 270 historical buildings, is an area of 38 square feet [38 sq m] and 76,000 square miles [76000 sq km] across the country are fully responsible for the care of the mother.
He has ten skilled workers, regularly investigating, watching and sometimes saving.
Scotland was even made by the leading organization in the Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten sisters from Scotland were born.
David Thompson, the director of the country, said that there was a real place for them.
"We have a place for our friends here in Treve says.
"We have many houses, many trees that have existed for a long time and a suitable place to live.
But there is still much unknown about our ancestors, so our work here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what they really need in order to increase them quickly."
He stressed that it was important to watch the mother’s breast before she was pregnant in the places because the possibility of a minor birth certificate would kill her and her 400 children, and could destroy a whole community of women.
The relatives are protected and the law prohibits killing them, tortures them, or puts them to death.
Elizabeth Farrell, elected Special Representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, urged the public to hand it over.
He says: "There is still much to learn about our ancestors and, for most of our species, we don't just know what kind of group they are."
Ronaldo rejected his apology and decided to witness to a German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo stressed that the charges against him were "false news," and said they were "to know people," using his name.
Her lawyer betrayed German journalist Der Spiegel, who published the same charge.
Portuguese and Juventus players were charged with leaving an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It was reported that she paid $375,000 to the woman after not telling the story, as Der Spiegel said at the outset.
Christian Ronaldo, 33, spoke directly with the video Instagram to more than 142 million fans and followers, a few hours after the complaint was published, thus reversing that it was “inaccurate news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, a lie, "is said the winner who received his gold medal and turned to the photographers.
"They want to know, they use my name.
It's legal.
They want to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm really happy and not worried," said the player, and he laughed.
He was prepared to accuse Der Spiegel of the false charge of Ronaldo's petitioner, they called it “an unacceptable and concern for personal life” according to Reuters report.
Lawyer Christian Scherts said he should be called upon for “an act of mind contrary to the scale of the event and its consequences” which is likely to be one of the greatest violations of human rights at this time."
It was said that it took place at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After they met at a theater, it was reported that Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, and that he was released from his ship, according to a notice given at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga then said Ronaldo was shocked after the incident and told him that he could be described as a good person "99 percent" but the "one hundred".
The report said Ronaldo agreed that they had sex but agreed."
Mayorga also said she went to the police and had a picture of the injuries she had received in the hospital, but later she agreed not to raise the case because she “was afraid that the case would be based on her again” and thought that she might be "a free man."
The 34-year-old woman just said she's going back to the case and she's still threatening the incident.
Ronaldo was already on the line to rescue Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the charges, and moved to the capitals of Juve Italy after the 100 million euros agreement last year.
Brexit: The Great Britain will be ‘to live forever’ when the car manufacturers break down
"To be sure, Great Britain will remain forever," said Secretary Greg Clark.
According to Toyota's addition, Britain in BBC said that if she leaves the European Union without any measures, the production of a kitchen in Burnaston, near Derby, could be permanent.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of the noise on the border was due to a lack of restraint in Britain.
The Burnaston factory that Auris and Aventis of Toyota can produce about 150,000 cars a year, 90% of which have been transferred to all the countries of the European Union.
"As far as I can see, if Britain departs from the European Union by the end of March, we will see that production will cease in our country," says Marvin Cooke, head of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers for Britain expressed concern about their departure from the European Union, with no agreement on how to carry out trade negotiations, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar and Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car drivers say about the service that might be available on the credit card as a result of Brexit's lack of agreement.
Toyota's production method is based on "times", with a piece coming every 37 minutes from the UK and the European Union's driver for a car that was only notified.
If the United Kingdom withdraws no agreement from the European Union on March 29, there may be an earthquake on the border that may cause people to feel angry and helpless in this business.
Toyota will not be able to stay for more than one more day to watch his production building in Derby, says the company manager, so the production has to be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's approach to the European Union's communication plan is "a clear sign to prevent corruption on the border."
"We need to make a deal We want to set the best possible measure, not just to live the success of the moment, as I have already said, so that we can use this event to benefit us, he says on a program on radio 4 BBC today.
"Toyota alone has already proved that there are still other producers we need to continue the process of joint work that has brought great success so far."
Toyota could not say that production would be slow, but he said that there would be a lasting problem, because the intervention would reduce the ability to compete with other producers and cause unemployment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a worker in Burnaston for 24 years and a member of the Society's meeting manager at the factory, said that his members were deeply affected by "If the situation I find is over, these jobs will not come back again.
The government spokesman also said: "We should put in place a healthy and successful plan of contact with the European Union later."
"Maison Blanche" may be re-examined by Trump's meeting with Rosenstein.
The meeting that could be very famous for Donald Trump and President of the Roseenstein Supreme Court is "no more weeks" because the war continues with Brett Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court, said the Maison Blanche newspaper this Sunday.
Roseinsten is closely watching the work of the special spokesman Robert Muelle, who is the last to conduct an investigation into Russia's electoral campaign, the relationship between Trump's and Russia's help and the possible threat of the court.
Either way, Trump will give the President the opportunity of the Supreme Court, and Mueller will no longer be able to leave, according to Washington's funeral for several months.
Rosenstein said he would hear his talk with Trump and talk about the possibility of leaving the president by law 25 this month's New York Times report earlier this month.
Roseinstein rejected the report.
But on Sunday he went to Maison Blanche, and there was another report that he was about to leave.
But there was a meeting with Trump in the United Nations in New York, as announced on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to leave Rosenstein but the beginning of the meeting was delayed in order to prevent unrest during the hearing of a Senate trial of Kavanaugh and a woman accused him of misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who both confirmed it.
On Friday, Trump conducted a week's FBI investigation of the complaint about Kavanaugh, and your election to the Senate was completely canceled.
Sarah Sanders, Deputy Secretary of Trump, is on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for this week is still out of place, probably this week, I see all the other things happening in the Supreme Court for a week.
But we'll see, I'll always tell the journalists."
Some journalists did not appreciate this apology: Sanders had never killed a journalist in Maison Blanche since September 10.
program provider Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the reform of the press is not because of the lack of love for the "new speaker's silence" on the television that he says: "I don't deny the dignity of theirs."
But he promised to increase the direct meeting of journalists and Trump.
"The president is meeting with more questions and answers than with previous presidents, "just as he added, there was no evidence: "We have already seen these figures."
The meeting is still going to be, says Sanders, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States a direct question, that is better than talking to me.
We will try as much as we can and you will find that we have done so many times over the last few weeks and will replace the press to allow you to talk to the president of the United States."
Trump always answers questions when he leaves Maison Blanche or when he participates in free meetings or when he visits the authorities.
It's not just a conversation with journalists.
Perhaps the president in New York this week showed why he didn't read the headlines and make a strange poem when the journalists were talking.
The Health Secretary wrote to the workers of the European Group at NHS Scoltand about his concerns about the possibility of Great Britain's liberation
The Health Secretariat wrote to the workers of the European Group working in the NHS in Scotland to express their appreciation for their country and their desire to stay after Britain's departure.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter to visit the European Group in less than a week.
It has already agreed to pay for the public's location of the European Group working for the government of Ecosse.

But the British government is already preparing for the possible conflict.

Christon Abercrombie Faces After His Head Attack · Global Voices
The turnout in the Tigra team of Tennessee State has been under severe attack after a head injuries on Saturday, winning Vanderbilt Commoders on 31-27, according to Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, a journalist in Tennessee State, told journalist that the accident occurred shortly before the first time period ended.
"He's coming to the edge of the field and looks like a trap here," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given by oxygenists and health workers at the border before he was transferred to a hospital and brought back to visit.
An authority from Tennessee State told WSMV agent Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was released to the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "he still has no idea of the damage he has received" and will try to help Tennessee State when the poll is under way.
Abercrombie and the first time she played in Tennessee State after she moved from Illinois.

Foreign buyers will be required to buy a house in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to gain wealth in Great Britain and will still contribute additional money to help the homeless in the new Tokyo plan
Corbyn's success in his campaign to observe the young voters' protest
It is thought to be against those who do not pay taxes in Great Britain.
The state budget estimates that it will increase to 120 million each year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be required to gain wealth in Great Britain and to add extra money to help the homeless, says Theresa May today.
It will be considered an effort to stop Jeremy Corby's success in his campaign to look at young voters, he promised to provide housing for the public and high-ranking people.
Everyone and non-profit companies in Great Britain will be expected to pay for this higher tax, adding money to support the government's war on street charges.
The rate of overcrowding is now greater, including the highest demand since the two years since the two-beds and the sale of houses to be built could reach up to three hundred.
The state budget is expected to increase to £120 million annually.
Thirty-six percent of London-based new houses are estimated to have been sold by non-residents in England, making their prices expensive and difficult for those to buy.
Many of the wealthiest parts of the country in the city have become "Chief City" because many of its citizens are foreign but spend most of their time abroad.
Boris Johnson has applied the new policy, which has just called on the pressure to help young people get a home for themselves.
He said that the land and houses were very expensive because large construction companies were using them but not using them, and he encouraged Rtoa May to set up house purchases in order to alleviate the "British property situation in Britain."
Mr Corbyn said several interesting ideas about the change in property, including the monitoring of homelessness and the removal of "no reason."
He also wanted to give more authority to the authorities in order to build new houses.
Ramatoa May said: "I have said last year that the restoration of Britain's dream is to have a better family.
And that means our oil will be spent on the property market.
England is open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not possible to buy a house in the same British country that works hard just as everyone else does not live in Britain, just like a foreign company.
For many people, they just dreamed of having a house, and the power of street witnessing is still visible and there is."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest wish is to run Scotland'
Sunderland's leader Jack Ross said his "most important wish" is to lead Scotland to a better future.
Scott, 42 years old, will be happy and ready to reopen the North-East Club, which has a third number in the First League right now, less than three in the first number .
The year after he led St. Mirren back to the Head of Scotland in the last game, he moved to the Lighthouse.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got B and that's it," Ross said in the BBC sound of Scotland's Sponsor.
"I was always proud of seeing Ecos in Hampden with our father as a child, and that was always what brought me back.
But I will be able to do so, if the club manages."
Ross has been involved in directing the Sunderland: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic leader said it was not difficult for him to follow the names listed for such green clubs, if the offer was rejected by Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success I had before was controlled by ‘Can I go back to the club with the First League?’
Because the way it works and conducts in the club is sure it's the First League," he just said.
"It's not easy to get it here, but I think I'll be successful if I can get back to the club."
He was only three years old when Ross, after working a small part-time as a helper to Dumbarton and was one of the trainers who had been busy there for 15 months.
Thus, he helped Alloa recover after his third count, and the next time St. Mirren was raised from the defeat of the winner's army.
And Ross said he's got a better life now than he's been doing during his exercise at Cycle, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It is certainly a service," he continued, about the reception of the Alloa.
"I really believed that it was better for me to control myself than to play.
It's a surprise to hear that I don't care about it, that I've developed a mind that lives in it, and that I've tried to have some perspectives on it.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things that you can do each week.
I still live there when I work hard and work hard but management goes for it.
I've always wanted to do it and I've done it now, so I feel that I've been in the best part of my life."
The entire survey, on Radio Scotland, will take place on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, from 12 hours to 1 afternoon, in England.
It's a good time to drink hot on Saturday morning at 5:30, according to an investigation.
The market did not go to these alcoholic beverages, but now people are full of heat, but food is no longer available.
According to the study, the market share of alcoholic beverages increased by 2.7 percent in July, but food prices decreased by 4.8 percent.
When Peter Martin, who advised CGA company, saw these figures, said: "The day was always set aside and England had a longer participation in the Battle of the Balloon Games, and the events continued from July to June.
The food distribution rate in June dropped by 1.8 percent, and the market stopped in July.
The place of sale of alcohol has now become the most popular and depleted place since it has been consumed by food.
Traders have also not lost their appetite for these hot temperatures, but only to gain the advantage compared to food.
It's like people just want to get out to drink.
The sales in these high-performance alcoholics sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food prices decreased by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, who looks at the welfare and hospitality of the RSM, said: "This thing has started since April, and continues.
The street vendors have become very tired of the weather and sports competition.
It is not surprising, therefore, that there is a constant concern about food, which is a real threat to them because the income has decreased by 4.8 percent over the year, but the price of food is rising and rising.
Food vendors are very confident about these high temperatures during these years, but we cannot say if the climate changes changed during August."
As the increase in the sales volume of these alcoholic beverages, including those recently opened, increased by 2.7 percent in July, even though there was no sales volume.
The sales manager of the Coffer Peach Tracker examined the results of 47 coffee and alcohol sales and alcohol companies in the UK, and found that the sales cost amounted to $9 billion, which led to a good walk.
One child in five has a secret account on a website that his parents don't know about
A survey conducted found that one child in every five – the smallest of 11 years of age – has a hidden account on a regular website that his parents or teachers do not know about.
Some 20,000 students were interviewed and many said they had a "insta hidden page"
The news says they are threatening to increase what they share.
20 percent of the children said they have a "closed" account to get to know their parents.
1 child of every 5 – 11 years of age – or the adult has a hidden account on the web site that he does not know.
A survey of 20,000 students in the school was conducted and found that children with "insta hidden" accounts have increased, that is, on the Instagram website that can be shared.
The news says they are threatening to increase what they share.
20 percent of the children said they have "contained" accounts to show their parents, but they also have hidden accounts.
A single mother saw her 13-year-old daughter's black account, and found a young woman telling people, "I'm going to sleep."
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, found that 40 percent of the 11 - to 18 - year - olds had double accounts, and that half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "There are many young people who want to open a secret account that their parents and teachers don't know."
Elid Doyle is a "son of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics council
Elidh Doyle was appointed by the Scottish Athletics Board to attend the annual meeting of the organization.
Doyle, the most famous athletes in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie, announced that this has been done to enable the organizers to benefit from Doyle's ability and experience in the last decade at the international level.
"Eidh is highly respected by the sports community in Scotland, England and around the world, and we can be sure that the sportsmen in Scotland will benefit if they are included in the council," Beattie said.
I Doyle says: "I am happy to represent myself in the "son of athletes," and I hope that I will be able to move and help to improve sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-foot football team in Atlanta in 1996 – who had four of his gold medals – and often expressed a self-esteem in BBC, was unable to walk because blood in his brain stopped immediately.
He wrote on Twitter: "I'm on a bloody road, one month today.
I can't run.
The doctor said that I don't know whether I'm going to die or not, but it depends on the passing of time and doesn't think how.
It’s so hard, I’m really tired now, I’m starting to go back and can get a little rest!
Thank you for the encouraging message!"
The drug trade is a debate on the Internet, which compares the mother's mother to the female
A water-producing company that compares believing and female mothers has led to a discussion on the Internet.
Elvie's company published a video video showing a family parent who commented on the use of this device, when she did what she called: "The first silent voice in the world."
This is part of the song that contains four beautiful family mothers in a crowded house: "I only take water from me, but I don't have a train" and "If you don't see it well, I don't see it."
And again: "I'm helping, I'm helping, I'm giving children water; I'm helping, I'm helping, I'm giving these women water."
However, when the sales document, which was published on the company's Facebook page, generated a lot of debate on the Internet.
The video was seen by 77,000 people, and hundreds of people commented on it. It was different from the reaction of the people who saw it, and many said that it was a "bad story" for the water-producing company.
"The idea that the drug was used was not wrong.
For example, these eggs need to be taken before there is water, unless their baby is taken out of the womb before it is born," said one person.
The Elvie/Mother can be hidden in the gorge soutien soutien soutien (Elvie/Mother)
Others also wrote: "It is unlikely that the parents and children will be able to think and be afraid of them.
But why are they used to make a hand-carp for mothers who care for their children?"
Others say, "It's a brand-new product."
For example, one woman said that the song was “excited. ”
"It's a good idea.
I bought an example from a fellow believer
I felt like a girl when I used help.
The market has been a little easy before, but it's just what I want.
The idea is very good," said one person.
Another wrote: "It's made to promote a family’s use of help (in the use of or in the exit room) that makes it feel like a "mby" piece of paper.
The product has not been opened up or criticized by the water-based producer company."
At the end of the video, all the women who played were showing the help they had done in soutien.
There are a lot of women who think of themselves as a baby when they use help. And what they really want to show is what they want to do behind the shopping cart.
The Elvie Paompy doesn't really sound, it doesn't need a call but comes in soutien, so the parents can act or keep their children and can walk on the street when they use the aid.
Ana Balarin, who is an ECD and a member of Mother's company, commented: "Paompy Elvie is going to change people's lives and should make a big deal of it.
We want to show everyone the feelings of our parents as we compare them to women in the market, and everyone sees the suffering of these women, so that the market is able to make women feel more secure by using this help.
Elvie's Paddy has not yet become an interesting news item.
Two mother-in-laws used the equipment for the famous Marta Jakubowski, during the Fashion Week in London.
Hundreds of children living in a refugee camp in the border of Texas
The number of children who have moved has increased, even though the number of people who have moved abroad every month has not changed. The talk by Trump and his strong policy has made it more difficult for them to accept and care for them even if someone is willing to take care of them.
In the past, only people who moved without a letter of law were often caring for these children, and they became afraid that they would not be able to stay in the country if they asked for a child home.
The fear increased since June because the federal authorities announced that adults with children and other adults should pay their salaries in the same way, and then give the immigration authorities the same.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the director of the Movement and Customs Force, told the Congress that there were dozens of people asking for a child born to the organization.
The organization then said that 70 percent of the victims had not been protected from crime.
"More than 80 percent of the people who ask for these, or their families, are immigrants but have no legal letter, and many of them are criminals in their country of origin.
We're still looking for these people," Atoa Albence says.
The organizers are eager to handle the case of their children and have created new laws that will allow their children to raise tribunals 30 days after their arrival, instead of waiting for 60 days like the previous practice, which is common in the detention camps.
Many use videos, but not directly when judges are judged for migrants.
What has been judged has no choice but to return to their country of origin soon.
In a few months, the people working in their children's camp have said that when the children are arrested, they become more afraid and discouraged, and that some are even trying to escape.
Lawyers say that they have increased their potential from a larger organization such as Tornillo. They are afraid, they say, children who worry about not getting any care.
They also said that if the children were taken to the camp but the time they had given them to prepare their minds and hearts when they left their friends, the pain and the fear they had already experienced and that they needed a lot more.
American, French and Turkish soldiers asked Syria to leave their country immediately
The Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke directly at the top of the United Nations meeting, and asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war in the country lasted for eight years.
Atoa Moualem, who is also a strong Prime Minister, declared that the soldiers had joined the Syrian country but had not been allowed, as they were growing up to fight terrorism, and "the punishment they had earned."
"Those arms should be removed immediately and be unharmed," she said at her top meeting.
Atoa Moualem confirmed that “the war against terrorism is imminent” in Syria, and more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee.
He also said that Damascus "keeps up the holy war" "to clean the Syrian land" to allow terrorists and other illegal fires in their land.
Some 2,000 US troops are in Syria, who have been asked to train and advise Kurdes and Syrian Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
More than 1,000 French soldiers in that country are fighting.
When Atoa Moualem spoke about refugees, he said that they could move to his country, and he blamed “some of the Western countries” who “screamed and scared” refugees and made them stay far away from their country.
"We have already called the International Family and the human rights organization to take away the remnant of refugees," he said.
"It's about humanity that they're asking for politics."
The United States and the European Union said they would not help to bring damage to Syria unless they made an agreement with Assad to stop the war.
The country's diplomat said that the agreement with Russia and Turkey had opened a political debate to establish a common area among Idlib's security forces.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented Syria (the Russian-supported army) from attacking the area of three million inhabitants.
Moualem confirmed, however, that the treaty's endurance was limited and said that Jihadits was expected to join the city's private forces, to be “completely clean”, including Al-Qaeda's fighters related to Nusra-Front.
Staffan de Mistura, a national diplomat, said that the government and opposition parties hope to have the first meeting of the new committee established by the government to establish a law for Syria to deal with the consequences of the war and lead to elections.
Moualem has taken action on the involvement of the Syrian government in the committee, including the judicial process "to re-examine the texts of the current law" and the warning on discrimination in the case of another country.
How to make sure Trump wins again
If logic is, Trump will only win the 2020 election if he can't win the election unless he can get rid of the kidnapping or rape and get away from the government as soon as possible and waits for liberal observers.

Since 2014, the number of CNN television viewers has increased by more than 1.05 million and MSNBC has already risen to three times as many as 1.6 million.
For Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million over four years ago. According to Nielsen and MSNBC reports, the number of students and followers in the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" is about 3.5 million as they are viewed by the newest of the night.

The president's year's election was accompanied by a considerable amount of money from abroad
It is no wonder that the money in the 17th District of Pennsylvania has increased greatly because of cooperation with the districts through a convention and has allowed two different opponents to fight one place.
This abandoned rural district of Pittsburgh has moved Conor Lamb from the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic to take place in other districts during the last special election.
Lamb now competes with other authorities, not just Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the 12th districts of former Pennsylvania that are closely in line with the new 17th district.
The map was returned after the Supreme Court decision in Pennsylvania in January that the former districts were unlawfully distributed to give the Republican benefits.
The competition to gain the seventeenth district has led to financial reconciliation between the money changers and the DCCC Congress, and the National Committee of the Republican Advertising (NCRC).
The name of the people in Pennsylvania became known as Lamb after the victory of all they could see at the special election of the 18th District Congress in Pennsylvania, in March.
The Republicans have been holding this place for many years and President Donald Trump has received the district in number 20.
Democrats have given little advantage to politicians.

Many diplomats suggest that Beijing has already accepted the Dominican Republic and Panama, which has contributed a little to Washington.
Atoa Trump met with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, he had a hotel in Panama waiting for security guards from the Trump organisation's management team.
According to a report from the beginning of this month, representatives from the Department of State have decided to call the US diplomat carrying out a movement from El Slvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to examine "the recent decision not to accept Taiwan," as well as Heather Nauertn and women to represent the department.
But only El Salvador was injured, which received food aid from 140 million dollars in the United States in 2017, including surveillance of drug use, development and financial aid.
The penalties considered to be applied, including the elimination of the payment and the elimination of legal visas, will certainly be very difficult for Central America to add to its unemployment and mass murder.
According to the developments in its meeting, the major conference on peace and economic development has been launched by the authorities in North and Central America to allow such meetings as last year, which has been seen as a step towards preventing immigrants from moving to the United States.
But at the beginning of September, the top authorities showed that they wanted to hold the conference, in order to end all the punishments that El Salvador should apply.
The conference was scheduled to be held by President Mike Pence, which should be held in mid-October, with the chairman holding the meeting to identify what was really important.
And the three American representatives returned easily to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, saying a harsh message about the punishments from Washington.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is fully prepared to meet with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers took Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that if they win the Austrians, after a war like in Spain with Villareal in the beginning of this month, they will be privileged to be in the G-based European League.
Graham Dorrans could not rise up because of his head injuries after a game of about 2-2 with Villareal, but he believed that the result could be used well by Rangers to start better things.
"It's great for us because the 31-year-old man is just a good place in Villareal.
"We entered the game and were confident that we would get results and went out with a number.
Perhaps we will be able to do so in the end but, anyway, the war is just like that.
They broke out in the first half but we will also come from the second half to do better.
It's approaching Thursday, another night for Europe.
There is a lot of hope that we will get three numbers but the game will be honored because they will have good results in the final game, though with the people who support us, I believe we will continue to make progress and see good results.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the terrible earthquake and tsunamis in Palu, Indonesia, by the authorities, as the number may continue to increase.
The connection was complete, so the authorities did not know the news from Dongäa, north of Palu. This was the location of the earthquake's 7.5 earthquake headquarters.
More than 16,000 people were deported from Palu after the accident.
This is about Palu and Donghea, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi capital, at the end of the river along the river of Sulawesi. The population was estimated to be 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th year, when its earthquake and tsunami appeared.
Doghea is a 300 km municipality that creates the north-west river of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality is smaller than its territory, and the population of Dogguea is estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
The region of the Central Sulawesi region is the main source of food, aid and agriculture, especially the coast of Dogguea.
There were also many tenants there, but in Morocco, on the coast along the Sulawesi River.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Donghea have been hit by earthquakes, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
A tsunami struck Donghea in 1938, killed more than 200 people, and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996 a tsunami struck Donghea and killed nine people.
Indonesia is in a large earthquake site in the Pacific, and it is often hit by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis:
2004: A major earthquake struck Aceh, North Sumatra, on the west coast of Indonesia, on December 26, which caused tsunamis in 14 and killed 226,000 people who created the Indian Ocean. More than half of those who died were in Aceh.

Sarah Palin's Infamous Child Imprisoned for Domestic Violence · Global Voices
Track Palin, near Sarah Palin, former Alaskan government, was arrested for violence, and candidates were arrested as vice president.
Palin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, was afraid of violence in his home because someone told the police that he was violent. He also opposed his arrest, according to a report by the Alaska Police.
The police say Palin's sister called the police to report the crime, and Palin handed the phone over to her.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su's prison and was sentenced to a fine of 500 dollars, KTUU said.
He came to the court on Saturday, saying "it's safe not to be guilty," according to news source.
Palin is a simple classic A, three-year prison sentence, that he may be imprisoned and pay $250,000 if he is convicted.
He was also subjected to a classic B assault, which would take him to jail one day and pay $2,000 if he was convicted.
This is not the first crime against Palin.
He was accused of violence against Todd Palin, his father, too, in December 2017.
Sarah Palin, her mother, called the police to report.
The Supreme Court of Alaska is now considering this case.
He was convicted of domestic violence in January 2016, according to a combined report, and had weapons and ammunition.
The woman with him said she threw the keys in her face.
In 2016 the armed forces opposed Sarah Palin because they said that this violent situation is related to the military situation in Iraq.

There are videos on different web sites, showing the earthquake.
Hundreds of people saved a party on the seabed, when Palu's tsunami hit.
Federal prosecutors are looking for the death penalty for the alleged terrorist activity in New York.
New York's federal prosecutors would like to find out if Sayfully Saipov, accused of committing a terrorist act in New York City, killed eight people.
Saipov, 30 years old, was reportedly using a truck to attack people on the road to the West Coast of Manhattan. He chased many passengers and drivers in October.
Saipov had to prove why he asked for an apology for death, that Saipov killed eight dead people, and that "a dead soul" injured people, according to a statement of the request for a death sentence, in South New York District.
These two charges could lead to a death penalty, according to the court's letter.
A couple of weeks after the attack, the deputy judge charged Saipov with 22 cases, including eight charges of killing people by criminal activity (a criminal offence used by law enforcement) and violence and car destruction.
The attack called for “good preparation and thinking ahead”, said the lawyer, and they explained how Saipov had done the attack with “absolute hatred, contempt and very evil.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has done everything to hurt, hurt, and offend Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," according to the report.
Five of the dead are visitors from Argentina.
New York's Supreme Court has been planning the final case for a death sentence for more than ten years.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but he was sentenced to death in September 2009.
A death penalty was already in 1953 in New York. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were killed, when the Soviet Union was sentenced to death during the Cold War two years ago.
He and his wife were killed in a power station on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, never showed up after the days and months following the attack, according to the court report.
He told the police that he had made his announcement that he was pleased with what he did.
Saipov told the authorities that he was forced to take the attack, after watching the ISIS video on his phone, according to the letter of apology.
She also asked for ISIS to be placed in a hospital room.
He said he was not guilty of the 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said they were "unsustained," in the decision of the prosecutors.
Patton also said: "The case will be longer and it will be a long way off for everyone involved, because the prosecutors decided to apologize for the death, not only did the person admit his guilt, but he would be imprisoned for his death, and he would never be released.
Saipov's lawyers asked the lawyer not to ask for a death sentence.
NIGEL Farage tells the European Group's standoffs that it should not be considered to lead to the European Group's exit agreement
Nigel Farage said in opposition to the European Group's stand-up debate, he has to ‘call the crowd’ today.
The former leader of the Ukip says the politicians should be “satisfied” from those who do not want to join the European group, and one of Theresa May's supporters says he should lead the discussion about the European Union.
Peter Bone, a native lawyer, said that the English demand for Birmingham would now be gone, if Farage was the author of the European Union's liberation.
But it is a major problem with the reconciliation of its supporters, as some of them have gone with the opposition to the rest of the European Union.
The prime minister is fighting hard for the ability to travel, as all who want to leave the European Union and who want to stay there, and even the European Union.
Her colleagues say that she should always make a deal with Brussels, even though it has already been established, so that those who don't like the European group and the working party will have to choose whether to accept their opinion, or find a 'crime'.
Ataa Bone told those who left when they left, during the Solihull movement, that he wanted to 'bet the prime minister's officers.
He said he should be a friend of Atoa Farage, and he would be expected to implement the agreement with Brussels.
He said: ‘We will be away from the European Union now, if I were responsible for it.’
Wellingborough's lawyer also said: 'I will support the European Union's liberation, but we should lose the refugees a little.'
He said, against the European Union: 'We haven't even been born before we had a fight in the major wars.
We want only if we establish the law for our country.
The idea that people may have changed their minds after the 2016 election was rejected by Atoa Bone. "The British people have not been able to change their mind, so they want to stay in the European Union.
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the European Union's opposition, said: 'I just say: Listen to the people, the Prime Minister.
'Most people don't like those who don't want to change, they won't choose, the opposition party doesn't like us and the protesters here, they're on the road, and they're going to vote for us first.
Don't follow those who don't want to change, but wait.'
This is the message he said to dRtoa May: 'The prime minister is kept in his job when he keeps his word.'
Politicians protested on Farage that they should be "feeling the heat" if they want to reverse the decision in the 2016 poll.
"Somewhere about us—people—and this is politicians," he said.
'They want to change the issue to the European Union, but we're here to tell them 'We're not going to let you do this.'
He said to the angry people: 'I want politicians to change their appearance to the European Union if you do "feel the heat".
'We call many people here, because they have made us decide to leave the European Union. We will never stop unless we become a self-sustained, self-government, and have the pride of Great Britain.'
In fact, the supporters of the European Union's stand-up went to Birmingham, before the two-hour event in the middle of the city.
Protesters brought banners, saying they wanted to stay in the European Union.
Adonis, in the Workers' Party, abused indigenous peoples as a result of the insecure security issue on the party's computer program, at the beginning of the review.
He said: ‘These are people who tell us that they can install information programs and technologies for Canada, for the wars on their borders, and for Ireland’s unbounded trade talks.’
'This is really bad.
There is no way that this will benefit the European Union," he says.
Warren is thinking of ‘a good review’ of the candidate's appointment as president of state
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says "he will carefully consider the candidate's appointment as president," after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about the future, during their discussion in the city hall.
Warren, who was often criticized by President Donald Trump, in November, to compete with the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was part of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Many have thought that it could compete with Trump in 2020.
His 36th meeting was held on Saturday morning in Holyoke, using the city's main election strategy, after Trump's power was taken.
One of those who met asked him if he was planning to be president.
Warren replied that this is the time "for women to go to Washington to improve our governance, so there should be women in the government's head."
Someone was arrested for shooting Sims, LSU player
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that the victim was arrested for shooting and killed Wade Sims, LSU's baseball player at Zoma.
Baton Rouge Police reports that Dytheon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested 11 hours a day.
They released a video of the shooting at Zoma, and they called people to tell who the man was inside.
Sims, 20 years old, died in the morning near South University.
"Wayde Sims was hit on his head by the shooting, and it killed him," said Murphy Paul, chief of police, to journalists, every 247 sports, on Saturday.
Wade protected his friend, so Simpson attacked him.
Simpson was investigated, admitted to the site, had a gun, and admitted to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested easily, and was kept in Baton Rouge Police.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, weighed 1,83m, and participated in the 32th game, and was one of the first 10 players in this game. He played 17.4 minutes on average, died 5.6, and played 2.9 rebond every time he played.
Grand Prix Rosianina: Lewis Hamilton became world leader, when the judge said he won Sebastian Vettel.
That is clear when Valtteri Bottas got to play before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, so Mercedes's team decided to take a lot of part in the race.
Bottas was very excited, and after Hamilton continued to protect his place during the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to meet his friend.
Vettel was the first to stay in the building, and allowed Hamilton to go, but it changed a lot.
The Mercedes were taken from the construction, and became after Vettel. However, Hamilton went on to date. Ferrari's driver was skeptical, so he left the way inside, so he could no longer protect his place, in his third attempt.
Max Verstappen is the last one, and the seventh at the end of the first round, this is his 21st year.
But then he led most of the race, and kept it until the end, and met Kimi Raikkonen, who became fourth.
He only went to the construction on the 44th floor, but he could not increase his speed over the last eight, so Raikkonen went through the fourth.
It was difficult because Valtteri fought hard this weekend, and I was released, according to that man.
The team did a lot of good," Hamilton said.
A Real Misleading Spirit
President Donald Trump, during the protest on Saturday, confirmed that he did not publish a secret letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accused Brett Kavanaugh, who might have been appointed a high judge, to commit sexual crimes.
The president spoke during the event in West Virginia, but did not speak directly about Ford's words in front of the Senator of the Judicial Committee, but he said that some said that when considering what happened to the House of Commons, some said it was "bad and lying."
"It's a wonderful and exciting experience at the House of Commons, when you see anger, when you see people angry, bad, and lying," he says.
"When you see what he has published and the secret he has published, but he says slowly, "I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Did you publish a secret to Diane Feinstein?
Remember his answer... did you publish these letters? "Oh, how?"
Not at all.
I didn't do that."
How so?
Did we publish secrets... Oh, we didn't do that," he said, about the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July, explained ford’s complaint to Kavanaugh, and published it in September, but Feinstein said that his office did not publish the secret.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's words, and I didn't publish his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it secret, and I always did."
The president said, however, that the ban was unfair, in his speech on Saturday night. "It was a very wrong move.
He probably didn't do it, but his reaction was the most wrong thing I've ever seen."
Although three women accused him of committing sexual crimes with them, the president said that these charges were made by political instruments by the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
"They are willing to support their opinion in all ways.
You see the excitement, regardless of what they have been arrested or forced to gain power and control,” says the President of the Mediate.
Link: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer, Giant's team, died twice, fighting Dundee
The team of Dundee was protected when the Belfast Giants hit the bridge, so they once again won 5-3 of the game back to Dundee this evening.
The Giants first died by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
But Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie left it, and Dwyer died the third, leading the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard renegotiated for Dundee, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen killed the two leaders of the victory.
His third team of Adam Keefe lost this Elite League, but they won Dundee 2-1 at midnight in Belfast.
In addition, these teams competed in this game year, and the Giants won the first three games.
Dwyer died of a gun from Kendall McFaull at 3.35, and David Rutherford helped Beauvilleer so that they could move four minutes later.
Many footballers died at the beginning, and Sullivan restored the players in the game at 13.10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt beat him for Crownie, at 15.16 minutes.
Dwyer did this to make Giants turn on the first time, because he killed the second ball at the end of the first time that night.
However, the householder replied again, and Bouchard raised their number at 27.37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to save Nielsen's death, so that Dundee would be the first in the game, in the second half. He did what his team would win with five, and that was the number that was finally split.
The Giants are now the fourth of his five games, and in his country he will play the next game with Milton Keynes.
The Rescuer Is Dead, to Help Hundreds of Aircraft to Bring Good News · Global Voices
It was noted that the rescuer in Indonesia had a strong heart because he had done something to help an aircraft carrier bring hundreds of people to safety.
More than 800 people have died, and many have not yet been found, after the great earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
The earthquake continues in many places, and many still suffer from the earthquake in Palu.
A 21-year-old colleague of Antonius Gunawan Agung fled to save his life, but he did not escape from his labor camp at Mutira Sis Al Jufri, Palu, despite being severely beaten.
He stopped to help the rescuer of Batik Air Flight 6321, who will be seated there, and the plane is in good condition.
He then jumped out of his workshop when he thought it was going to fall.
Then he died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, director of the Air Navigation Indonesia, says this decision has probably saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We planned a helicopter from Balikapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Sadly, though, this morning the helicopter stopped at Palu.
"We can hear it from our heart," he said.
However, the authorities are also afraid that the number of deaths will still be a thousand, as the way for victims to be allowed to go to Donganda, Sigi and Boutong was blocked.
"This number continues to increase, as many deaths are still under the headlines there, but many are still missing," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for survivors.
There was a hole up to six meters away from Palu, so many were on Monday.
The military and civilian aircraft are now reporting assistance and tools.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says in Sky News: "There's a patient's car coming every minute, reporting death.
The water is fresh and fresh.
The collapse of the market is everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, president of the Croix Rouge Internationale in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Croix Rouge is running to help the living but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already too dangerous that it might be even worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widododo came to Palu on Saturday and said to the nation's army: "I ask all of you to work at night to complete all the work related to the release of people from danger.
Are you killed?" said CNN report.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was devastated by the earthquake that took place in Lombok, which killed 550 people.
From Micronesia's airport: Air Niugini says there was a man who was invisible because of the crash of the plane to riokasia (a dobo connected to the sea)
The railway train that has now landed in the Pacific coast in Micronesia says there is a man who has not been hit, after saying that all 47 passengers and workers have been blessed by the flying plane.
The Niugini airport reported in its release that since the afternoon Saturday she could not explain a man's personality.
The airport said she worked with local authorities and hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airport did not arrive immediately and answered questions about the passenger's item; something like his age or his country of origin.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews when the aircraft was in the water if it was trying to sit on the Chuuk airport.
The authorities told Zoma that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The train said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all their health is no longer concerned.
It is still unclear what caused the earthquake and the real events.
The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy said they went into the race when they didn't get the track.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane was more than a pist.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the airport was very low.
"That's a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to walk into the water to save the exit if there was a danger of the plane crash.
She said she was scared and the hosts were down, and she suffered a little damage from her head.
The U.S. Navy said the nearby ships working on the improvement of the ship were helping to rescue by using a boat that could be used to transport people to the land, before the plane was set up at 30 feet (100 feet) below water.
The instructions from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people died on a plane crash in the PNG-based train for decades but not including Air Niugini.
The runner represents a period of time in the darkness when women are still alive
The witness was able to prove all the evidence on Saturday at the second trial of the man accused of murdering a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The reader from the U.S. Department of Justice., Paul Rowlett stood witness for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation.
He wrote to the court how he used the adoption to announce the actions of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received advice on the location of many mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the morning of his death, which was contrary to his previous statement, says The Clarion Ledger.
When he showed the suggestion that his phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in court on Saturday and proved that he was not in the villa that day.
When the publisher asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck tonight, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck said he was in Nashville."
Tellis also said that he knew Chambers about two weeks after his death.
The cell phones indicate that they knew each other every week.
Rowlet said that it was a time after Chambers died that Tellis managed to get off his cell phone to write and call and talk about Chambers.
"He's gone away from his life," said Hale.
Sabots' defenders have taken the time to launch the final decision.
The judge said the war was expected to be in the juries only after that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
There are three musicians who try hip hops to examine the way they view this kind of thing, by filling their music with the good news.
The High Breed from Bristol says the hip hop has gone away from her family as a political message and talks about social problems.
They want to return to their base and restore the conscious hip hop for people again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have found another explosion in ROYAUME-UNIS through such an artist as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A nurse from NEW YORK preached to a married couple who ran away after writing "seems of discrimination"
A child nurse from New York witnessed to a couple because of a full-fledged divorce when she received a wrong copy from the mother claiming to be "another black person."
The couple refuse to be prejudiced and compare the preaching with the preaching of the good news."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who was born two, expressed disappointment when he found that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black on his first day in 2016.
"I HAVE TO BE A LITTLE OLONA MAINTY HAFA INDRAY," wrote a letter sent by my wife to his wife by the Plato-Flaxman.
Either way, if he should have sent it to his wife, he would have sent it to the Maurice drama twice.
When the "unsatisfied" Plasco-Flaxman felt his loss, he ran away from the Maurice drama, saying that the former child nurse who was an American was unable to do his job, and he moved to the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice's car was taken over one day at work and sent back on top of it.
Maurice now preaches to the couple to get her out and waits for $350 a day for a week, the first job she had to do with, even though there was no agreement.
"I want to show them that you don't do anything like that," he said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's a crime."
The couple responded to the claim that they were being discriminated against and said that the end of Maurice’s work was the right thing to do, because they were afraid that they would not trust him after they hurt him.
"My husband sent an unexpected message to him."
He's not a boxer.
His wife, Joel Plasco, says we're not a racist.
"But will you place your children in the hands of people you have not respected, even if it has caused a lack of faith?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco, who likens the preaching to “screaming” and says that her husband has had her children for only two months and she is in a "hard place".
"Are you looking for someone like that?
It's not very pleasant to do it," the bank operator said about the use of money.
While the case is still under way, public justice is very quick to blame spouses on social networks, beating them for their behavior and logic.
Writers of the Paddington book are concerned that readers don't understand the language, according to the new text
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the text: "It's hard to sit in a person's place if you first read it before it was published.
It is very encouraging to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
He says that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before he had the inspiration to write the book for children through a small game, might be angry at the rejection of his job, the 60th anniversary of the release of the books was a "crowd trip" after his death last year, he added his words.
As for Paddington, whose domain is "the most important problem in the family," he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He's a bad man who doesn't say, and he's not a selfish man," she says.
"But since Paddington is real, it's like you have a child who can do things: you're proud of them even if you didn't.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Despite his creations and his thoughts, Paddington has always made mention of it."
My daughter was gone and I had to live on the phone
Her daughter was recently sent to Nice Louis Pasteur 2's hospital, but the doctor worked only to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that his departure was very bad, saying that he didn't expect to do it," Dr. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a call from Nad saying he would die in two minutes and I had to save him.
And I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, I really like you, my sobian.
I will be with you shortly.
I will be with you.
The medications that the doctor gave him to keep his heart going were stopped and removed from his body.
A time before he died, everything ended.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I didn't complain or cry because in a situation where there were many families and people.
I had to keep it all."
At the end of Ednan-Laperouse's afternoon, when it was sad that his daughter had lost her daughter, the plane went up with other passengers – forgetting the difficult war she had experienced.
"No one knows."
"My head was raised and the tears rolled all the time.
It's hard to see that I felt the relief of Nad touching me during the train.
He needed my love and ability to live in his own place.
I know he really loves him."
A grieving woman puts a letter to prevent suicide in the streets
Two women who lost their loved ones in death work to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys published a letter from Welsh with an encouraging message and phone number that people can call for help.
Davis's 13-year-old son, Tyler, started to suffer from violence and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want parents or anyone to feel what I feel every day," she says.
Ramatoa Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a desperate host who had recently moved to talk to him.
"He knows everyone with his smile."
They kept saying that his smile explained all the rooms."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in the "very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, saw his brother only after he killed himself.
This is what Aunt Davis said: "I've always been worried that this will have an effect."
Miss Davis wrote the letters, "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk about, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in the dark – you need to talk."
Ramatoa Humphreys, who had been a friend of Davis for many years, lost his wife to Mark for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt tired or tired or something else," he said.
"We saw a change in his attitude two days before the Crisis.
She was very focused on Christmas day – she didn't look at anyone, anything, when she opened up her children's gifts."
He said that his death was a major harm to them but they had to do what they would do: "This has caused a lot of trouble in the community.
This led to a separation from us.
But we must continue our lives and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake because the FBI is starting the investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked us – a temporary, limited, limited - we could have brought unity," Flake said on Saturday, he continued to say that he was worried about the "coming" committee in the street without any support.
Why is the Kavanaugh Lord and his Republican supporters not pleased with the FBI's investigation?
Their lack of motivation is a matter of time.
The upcoming election is just five weeks ago, on November 6 - if the Republicans don't leave, they will be ashamed of their efforts to get the man they are looking for in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush received a phone call to prepare the Senate, encouraging them to support the Kavanaugh Lord who worked in the Bush House only and saw his wife Ashley, who was the special secretary of the Bush Lord.
What will happen after the FBI released its ticket?
There will be elections in the House of Representatives, which are currently 51 republics and 49 democracys.
It is still unclear whether it would be possible to get at least 50 stones in the Kavanaugh National Assembly room, which would allow Deputy President Mike Pence to compete with him and put himself in the Supreme Court.
In North Korea, the number of opposition members turned to Kim.
The number of North Koreans moving to South Korea has increased since Kim Jong-un arrived in the last seven years, says one South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, who wrote a report from the Ministry of National Affairs, said there was a move to 1127 opposition in the year - compared with 2706 in 2011.
Andrimatoa Park said that it was the main reason for the stronger surveillance across the border between North Korea and China and the higher levels taken by my driver.
Pyongyang did not make a public special comment.
Most immigrants from the north were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border.
Most of them are fleeing from China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to compare than without a military area (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China considers immigrants to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often arrest them.
It has been noted that relations between the North and the South have improved – which is still fighting on the technical side – over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, two country leaders met in Pyongyang to talk about the illegal agreement on the termination of the construction of the security equipment.
This was after a historic meeting in June with US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed with their generals to work to reach a nuclear nuclear power.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US punishment for the lack of progress so far.
"If there is no confidence in ETAZONIA, the peace of our country will not be assured and in that situation there is no point in leaving our first weapons," said Driammaa Ri in his speech at the FIRENA Conference in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "a little fool," saying he can't work in the Supreme Court.
Deputy Prime Minister Nancy Pelosi called the candidate to vote in Supreme Court, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, saying he could not work in the Supreme Court if his condition was considered.
Pelosi made this comment during the Saturday session at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't imagine that if a woman did that, they said "the example of the little fool," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness by Kavanaugh before the Senate's trial on Sunday.
Kavanaugh has deliberately ignored the claims that he has been sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they are still alive.
During his first speech, Kavanaugh was very enthusiastic, sometimes he almost complained and complained during his discussion about his family and his studies in the third grade.
He also publicly blamed the Democrats on the committee, calling for his resignation as a "man-of-the-art killing movement" that the liberals were accused of the failure of Hillary Clinton to elect as president of the country in 2016.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony was an excuse for his inability to work in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was fighting against democracy.
He said: "I think that he only did what he would not know about these statements, as well as how he persecuted Clinton and the Democrats."
Pelosi questioned whether Kavanaugh’s integrity seemed to be concerned if he lost it, and whether the Democrats were getting more from the National Assembly.
"This is what I say - if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, it's not only in the Supreme Court but even in the court he's in the next day at the same time," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a D.C judge at the time of the Court of Appeal Federale.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a judge of the practice.
In listening to him to confirm the situation, Kavanaugh asked questions about the possibility of violating certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for stupid people to go to court and expect us to say, "Don't be fun," says Pelosi.
And women need to use it.
This was a real challenge, for months and years, we had to give up, and we could not raise our children without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, and you?"
He continued: "A woman who was a kadre there really helped me to say that she was also crying when she was angry, but she wrote a project that meant that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the people she was saying: "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept walking
And I thought it was really cool."
The sea can be launched as a form of a partial outburst of anger, as people cannot find their source.
One of my greatest memories was that I started working, at a man's office, where I once got very strong because of my unexplained anger, to take my older sister to my bed – a very bad manager who always threatened me – was sent to the station.
"Don't let them find you crying," he said to me
"He doesn't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they're coming to their destination."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democrat at the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart as president.
In 1987, when an outsider was involved in a marriage in a ship called Monkey Business Andrimatoa Hart, Ramatoa Schroeder, when in a very short time, there was no reason why he should not consider becoming president of the country.
"It's not a good decision," he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There have already been seven runners to choose from the competition, and the last thing they need is another runner.
Someone called it "Blanche Neige and the Seven Boys." "
Since the campaign has already passed, he agreed to collect money, and he argued that he would not go into the competition unless he stood up for $2 million.
It was a war that had not been successful.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 for men only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm being robbed?" she asked herself.
If he did the speech that he would not do an official campaign, he was really touched by the feelings — thanks to the people who supported him, the sincerity of the system that made the collection and the decision of voters not the representative to be difficult, and the anger of the discrimination against men and women - he was already cruel.
"You may have thought that I was completely disappointed," Rtoa Schroeder recalls her journalist’s reaction.
"You may have thought Kleneex was a support company
Do I remember what they're going to do over my face?
"She cried?"
How the US and China's trade wars can be a blessing for Beijing
The deployment of arms in the US and China's trade wars has been slow, and if the war is not over, Beijing can benefit from the long-term separation of these countries, according to experts.
Donald Trump, who is president of the United States, sent the first warning at the beginning of this year by means of a major Chinese campaign, including the solar, wind, and aluminium panels.
The most rapid increase this week with a new amount of $200 billion ($150 billion), has been imposed on half of all Chinese troops entering the US.
Beijing responded to each move, and here it has raised five to ten percent of US$60 billion.
China promised to connect ETAZONIA's hotshot, and the world's second largest economy cannot be expected to detect soon.
The harassment of Washington means a humiliation in front of the demands, but the humiliation in the face of the U.S. is something that doesn't bother Xi Jinping President of China.
However, experts have said that if Beijing’s play is possible, it is possible to support China in a long-term way the US’s efforts to combat trade, by reducing the level of cooperation between the two economies.
"The ability of a political decision in Washington or Beijing to bring about situations that start economic collapse in one of these countries is even more dangerous than the experts have accepted if it is true," says a researcher named Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of researchers.
Syria 'is dead' to bring refugees back, says Foreign Minister
Syria says that refugees are ready to return voluntarily and call for help to rebuild the country after the seven years of war.
When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem spoke at the United Nations Meeting, he said the situation in the country improved.
"Now, the local situation is more peaceful and secure than the development of the war against terrorism," he says.
The government continues to restore the crime scene to restore the law.
All the measures needed to bring refugees back to their homeland for terrorism and the necessary economic measures that affect their daily lives and their lives are now in place.
More than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still live in the country need help from a searcher who will improve their personality.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would receive help to rebuild the corrupt country.
But he confirmed that he would not accept assistance from countries that supported trafficking.
Europe has won Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup in 2018 with the US Team at the latest 16.5 is 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The ETAZONIA is now nine years old in European countries and has not received Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe is able to recapitalise once it reaches 14.5 which they have requested to defeat the US of Captain Thomas Bjorn's team.
ETAZONIA's star, Phil Mickelson, who fought most of the competition, broke down the water tank at par-3, a length of 16, contributed to the game between Francesco Molinari's bats.
The Italian golfer Molinari was born during his entire career, becoming a player 1 of 4 from 5-0-0 because the current stage of the game began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was released by the lowest player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark on 5&4.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, who was the first player, fell down 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England who might have played the latest Cup Ryder.
Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the biggest winning player in Europe with the number 25,5.
"I'm not often a tearsy but today I really don't have my tears.
That was a difficult year.
Thomas especially appreciates my choice and trust me.
I was very happy, and I was happy to have a cup of coffee again.
This is what led to the team, and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia was moved after Europe’s victory.
He transferred the threat to his brother John Ram, who banned American golf players known as Tiger Woods at 2&1 on Saturdays alone.
"I don't believe my feelings about Tiger Woods. I've always looked at this man until I'm older," Rahm said 23 years old.
Woods has always won four games in France and has records 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
It's a strange question of the most appropriate permission of the player who received 14 titres after Jack Nicklaus alone.
The team of the USA has fought hard during the weekend to find a crime scene in addition to Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-end golf during a whole contest.
Jim Furyk, an American captain after his team's desperate attack, said, "I'm proud of these bands, they really fought.
There was a time when we fought Europe this morning.
We were tired.
It's a shock to Thomas.
He is the head of the army.
All 12 players are very intelligent.
We will meet, we will work with our Ryder Cup Committee with the US PGA and we will proceed.
I love those 12 bands and I'm happy to work as a captain.
You must be kidding me.
We're under their influence.
