I can't see you.
I don't understand what you're saying.
How long are you going to sleep?
You have to do something about it.

What have you brought?
He told me he was going to Venice.
Listen to me.
Can you believe it?
He's a little younger than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom's asleep outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's in the middle.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much?
How can they forget us?
I understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
What a joke!
Here's my book.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not very busy right now.
Where are you going on Saturday?
They're watching.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer was wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of it.
It's flying.
The train came in the same time, so we didn't have to wait.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new girlfriend?

I'm not kidding.
I'm not hungry now.
Where's the wrong one?
I can't be at the meeting.
It's a doctor.
I'll take you to the next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You should ask him for advice.
In March 1991, he was expelled from Harbot.
My son knows how to watch the clock.
I'm looking for a good hotel.
I'm a woman.
I'll be back in ten hours.
Don't make a difference.
I don't want to look at Tom.
He's a doctor.
Bye-bye.
I think you're sick.
I want a guitar.
Do I need to save my ass?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow morning.

They don't care.
How old do you want to get married?
My school was late.
I'm sorry, Tom.

I hope so.
Tom's been making a joke.
How are you?
He can speak French.
How old is this chart?
I want to go back to Australia before my passport expires.

It's Japanese.
Tom's running.
We love coffee.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
Tom loves me.
What have you missed?
I live here.
Tom's been missing almost every day.
He's wearing his rubbed-out.
Tom brought it.
I love him.
I'll dance.
Would you please tell me again?
I'll be back in three hours.
I'm yours.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Hold my hand.
What can they forget about us?
That's why you don't want to be alone.
Are you going to fuck with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to the bathroom.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Stay where you want.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We're Arab.
Tom's in pain.
Where are you?
Hold on a second.
I lost your phone number.
Everyone's here.
Will you eat something?
I can cut the shadow.
There's nothing left left in Frige.
Nothing happened.
Everyone's lying.
I'm your friend.
Time's up.
Try again.
Have you ever eaten fish?
And he gave the talk.
I love him.
How long you have been here!
I did my job.
I want my hat.
I was hungry.
I don't like my body.
Where he went, his dog went behind him.
Aren't you a doctor?
I saw him running.
Tom's the name of a boy and Mary's the name of a girl.
Tom's in the shower, isn't he?
What's your name?
Let's go.
How much is that?
Do what he says.
I think the train's slowing down.
It's in the middle.
I have two parts.
Hold it.
No one's talking.
Tom's talking.
I'm kidding.
What am I eating?
Leave Tom away from me.
What's your father's name?
I want to make some money.
Eat your two.
The people of Madrid are surprised.
People can't see the supernatural.
Let me know.
Tom's favorite.
I want you to come with me.
Tom Buru's dead.
Tom's gone crazy.
I don't like coffee.
Stay here.
Don't eat the chicken!
I heard you scream.
Call me.
Welcome.
I want some cheese.
Call the doctor!
I'm not worried.
Is this site empty?
We win.
My brother is two years older than I am.
Stop!
The hotel was created last year.
It's all gone.
I want guitar.
Stop that woman.
What will you do now?
Don't talk.
You can write in any language. All languages are equal in Tatoeba.
They're there.
It's his house.
All these people say English as their first language.
This house is my hideout.
Where can I sing kham?
Let her go.
I forgot his name.
She doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom was with me all day.
How long do you have to go to the station?
Who ate?
Where can I sing Tikkit?
How old is your dad?
He can say Japanese.
How many buses do you take to walk to the walkway?
My feet are shaking.
How many colleges?
You can read here.
I think Tom's happy and excited to see you.
He's smaller than me.
Tom chocolate likes so much.
I'll go now.
Have fun.
I came back late last night.
Are you out of your mind?
Eat whatever you want.
Don't touch me.
Is that far from here?
Where's the boy?
How long does New York train leave?
I'm tired.
I love her.
Would You Welcome a Visit?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Nobody understands me.
Let's go.
New York is a country.
He sleeps like children.
Can you show me your board path?
Can you please help me?
It's smaller than me.
The victory is never easy.
I'll take care of it.
Do you have time?
I thought you'd be there.
Tom's very tired.
I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's smaller than me.
I think Tom's fine.
I'll be back in Australia in two days.
Tom told Mary he was going to kill himself, but he wasn't as bold as he was.
Can you take the fish with us?
Although it's not bad for itself, in many places it's seen too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm tired.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't die anymore.
Look at the car.
I'm eating.
I don't want to go to the only dance.
How far from this station?
He was sick by the end of the last week.
Tom's been pushed through the bar, but no one's gone.
He's a doctor.
Shut up.
My head's broken.
Go to the hospital.
The state has returned.
Please forward the new one.
The pen is broken.
Tom keeps talking about him all the time.
And it doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I don't believe it.
Wait outside.
I want a taxi now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
It's almost three times that way.
Tom wants me to go with him.
Let's try it again!
Tom Klant.
Don't forget about us.
Tom was talking.
I'm in the south of the north.
You're very proud to see me.
Tom was waiting for me all the time.
He's eating.
He was sick and sick last week.
I'll see you next month.
We need to communicate with Tom's parents.
Where can I buy that paper?
I'll be back in seven hours.
Is the chest too deep?
I was late.
Call Tom.
How much?
Tom saw her.
How long is your plan?
Tom Long, but not as long as I am.
He's my wife.
I don't think I'm very good at it.
Where's the Porton office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Are you here?
What happened?
$100 with bad pockets of the house.
I'm not very good at France.
My dad's going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Police dock!
I was curious.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get out of this ship.
That's Tom.
He's not here yet.
Kim's funny.
I'm not in town.
Women are changing the world.
Get some rest.
I don't want Tom to see me in this situation.
Tom started screaming.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It's worth $30.
Start here.
We waited for them.
I like the yellow color.
Tom was right about keeping a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you kidding me?
Can I have a check?
Do you have anything bigger?
Tom brings two of me.
I need it.
I don't think you need any help.
Wait outside of Tom Gate.
Don't wait.
Is the room open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat out today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's in trouble.
He ran away.
Are my London pages ready?
Where can I play it?
I need to send a fax.
He's eating a little more.
He taught me to write.
Call my husband.
I could play that song.
I was desperate.
Where's Boston?
Our Duckies.
The rules are easy.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're much better than me.
He's not here yet.
I can't move my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom Choret was arrested.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Can you understand me?
When Tom heard that Mary married another man, he was very upset.
It depends on efforts in most areas.
Tom's in a lot of hands.
Tom didn't hit his head.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows that now.
I got my juice.
I'm sorry.
Is that what you're reading?
What's in the bag?
Connection has been lost.
Can I get a stick?
Have you ever lost your leg?
I want to name the next step.
How are you?
I'll go to the doctor tomorrow morning.
I can't believe it!
Isn't that right?
He's not here yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

In Tom's condition, he was arrested for driving.
Tom and Mary's artist.
Tamori was born in 1945, when the second world war ended.
Ask again.
They're wrong.
He'll close the door for a long time.
What does that word mean?
He's running now.
Good evening!
Go inside.
Keep an eye on the door.
I'm a doctor.
He's not here yet.
I left Tom Jackson on my name.
I've read your book.
Let's go.
I'm looking around a little bit.
Here's your key.
He didn't go to the party.
The room's closed now.
My hands are shaking.
Everyone saw it.
It's a good lie and not a lie.
He sleeps like children.
Who are they?
What do you want me to say?
Would you please speak more slowly?
It's still mine.
Don't come.
Tom, you can't get out of this.
Too bad for Tom's body.
You can choose what you want.
Tom helped me.
Let him go.
Let's wait here.
How long does the satellite bus leave for the airport?
Stay at home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if I'm gonna have time to do this.
Tom keeps talking about him.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom's got something to do with it.
Tom's gone.
You go ahead.
We've had dinner all night.
School will start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Where's that down there?
A football game.
The sky is clear.
Nemscher!
I really appreciate your generosity.
He told me he was going to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's left.
What does this mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Have I done a little too late?
Let her go.
I can't be right.
Language is a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom before.
How long does the train leave for Tokyo?
Tom's wearing a big shirt.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to the bathroom.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you something.
The barf's aboriginal rapist.
Come out.
They're kidding.
I ran away from home.
We built pancakes for the first time.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know. I don't know if I'm coming.
You're kidding.
He's gone.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I'll feed my bungalow in the morning and in the morning.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please just give me my promotion.
Do what he says.
You're very proud to see me.
Tom started screaming.
Stay there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom keeps talking about her all the time.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today is 18 June and today is Muriel's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to tell our empty Tom to do this, right?
Can I get these cards out of the way?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom owes it.
Someone's a bitch.
I went to Bakery.
I learned to survive without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Get some rest.
Tom was very busy with the job.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I'll see.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm watching.
My hands are not working properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He's gone crazy.
Who are you?
I could die.
Are you sure?
We have to go now.
He's missing the reading.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He easily got his head burned.
Where he went, his dog went behind him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
My nose's getting old bottles.
My teeth are good.
I don't want to go.
When's the bus going to drop next?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bike?
What do you want to come?
My mother can play very good golf.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did he say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Hurry up!
Shut the fuck up.
Was Tom there?
I've been bleeding twice today.
My leg's still shaking.
Where's Tom?
They think they're American.
You were the only friend of Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted her invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his uncle Jackson.
You've known Tom for a long time.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
I haven't reached my destination yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom's got very little to say about him.
Something's wrong.
Is anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm going to check.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
What's that doctor?
And a little nibbies?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that chaste?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to request my warrant?
We do what we want.
Tommy's right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for all students whose mother tongue is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who will you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I thought.
No one's useless.
Are you here?
The rest of us were laughing.
How long will you stay?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I lost my mind.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to shoot Tom.
My son's got the money.
The sky seems to be a little early tonight.
How much will it cost?
You better know what Tom wants.
We will.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those who are in the kitchen shouldn't have to cut their feet.
Why are you kidding?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to my hospital.
Tom wants his hat back.
Is Tom home?
Tom keeps talking about him all the time.
I'm going to have some fun.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided into a river east and west.
See for yourself that way.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tomo's playing guitar.
Do you have any idea what you're going to do now?
He's running now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
That's what's going on.
How many are these gods?
How much more money should I give?
Everyone liked Tom.
What's going on here?
Here's your key.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
Get some rest.
Eat what you like.
Take it.
Have you ever lost your leg?
He's gone crazy.
We learned English.
I couldn't get my right foot.
I'm sick of it.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Korgosh likes Gaza.
You don't understand.
I'm losing my mind.
Sit on the table.
He's a little younger than me.
What's your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use a credit card?
It's too big tonight, isn't it?
This book can be found only in France.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I borrow credit cards?
Tom found my bike.
I went to Jackson's house.
He's got a black hat.
Anything else?
They're all locked up.
Is there a lesson for the students?
I'm eating nodules.
Tom's inside the house.
No matter how they are, ask what they're doing.
Would You Welcome a Visit?
I'm telling you.
We like football.
What are you eating?
Good evening.
He's empty.
I want new tools for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Have fun.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll go to the bathroom even if it's raining.
My right arm's on my right.
My father was busy.
All ready to go.
I couldn't get the 700 train.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's figure it out.
Would you like a drink?
The class doesn't start before eight o'clock.
How much time do you spend on that?
What does that word mean?
How do I get it?
Can you speak English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is far away from me.
Tom's father was a singer.
Here's your business.
Tom's alive.
She's seen in the fax.
Answer me.
This is my bag.
Tom's gone crazy.
How much of it?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go of it.
I'm a little tired.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Squeeze.
How old are you?
Take Tom.
They're watching.
You're kidding.
I don't think tomorrow's gonna rain.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I'm good at it.
And he grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Three people have been killed.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom's father is a security officer.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now it's time.
I'll never make a mistake.
Where's the locker door at UA 111?
I'm kidding.
Why are you watching?
Tom wants his hat back.
How much time do you usually start?
The country has signed a contract between them.
I'm talking to Tom in an empty French language.
Tom's eyes are dead.
Can this be a bit of a gypsy?
Tom's in the garden now.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's a liar.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The rebels left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but it wasn't my time.
I've lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has taken part in the attack.
Get out of the city!
Please wait while the game is being played.
He's eating.
How old is that priest?
Let's go!
It's Japanese.
Did you see her grow up?
The satellite bus is leaving for the airport?
Don't rush.
It's my fault.
That's my bag.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got it.
We were on our feet.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom made a joke.
Tom's very low.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much of it?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
It's a good time to fly.
I don't know what you want to know.
Most of the visitors were business.
Turn right.
Tom's probably asleep.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom has won a lot of horses.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom Gods are gone.
Everyone was joking.
I'll be out.
My mother can do a good job.
They're watching.
The investigation was successful.
I think it's less likely that Tom will be given what he's got.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here's your key.
Let's talk about Tom.
Take your two.
Our name is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the folder?
Tom's in trouble.
Follow Tom's back.
Is Tom still on me?
Tom's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not crazy.
What do you know and say?
Listen to me.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you kidding me?
What's your father's name?
Look at this.
You'll tell me if I have to.
We tried.
Tom left in October.
The game is near the doctor's office.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this mean?
Tom's got his head down.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's Blue Anars.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Can you go out with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll keep it.
Everyone's ready.
Don't bother me.
Who was it?
I'm Lajuk.
When I said that Mary left town, Tom was really surprised to see her.
I heard the scream.
How long is your plan?
I don't want to talk about it.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up at 8:00 today.
Please let the light shine.
Tom's in pain.
I'm still your friend.
It took me two hours to translate some English pages.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is it a small road to get to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Did you hurt her?
It's impossible!
How long has the train been coming to Yokohama?
What's wrong now?
Words that don't fit properly. You can replace them with more common translations.
Your shoes are here.
Everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone ever reported anything to me?
I want to dance for you.
Listen, is this train going to Washington Square?
We failed.
There's ice in this house.
Are you all right?
Tom Boston was gone.
Clean up.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
The evening may be a break.
I'm not proud of her.
Who's there?
It's a mistake.
I don't have a clue anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Can you catch a fish with us?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
One minute.
Tom was in pain.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
You don't see!
As soon as possible, stop it.
Use it.
How long has the train been coming to Yokohama?
I don't understand that either.
I got up seven o'clock this morning.
I'm home.
Keep your eyes open.
Happy birthday!
I went inside.
Me too.
I'm not very busy.
It's so beautiful.
Get back!
Tom started in the kitchen.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow morning.
Tell me what you want.
My feet are shaking.
Ask Tom.
I think what I'm gonna give you on your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Good to see you again.
Why are you complaining?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We played the game.
I'm busy.
Where can I sing Tikkit?
I've finished my job.
I'm planning on staying at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom Chitkar started.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read it?
How old is your father?
Are you all right?
I've never seen Tom enjoy it.
Don't go inside.
We're lost.
Tom's watching.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I see it empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We waited for them.
How old do you think I am?
Tom's not happy here.
It's gone crazy.
I don't like coffee.
Tell me more about it.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
And what we don't do doesn't stop it.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can never play better than that.
We're Lajuk.
Billta's gonna be hit today.
I'm going to Paris in the morning.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Just eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
