Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the liberation of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament rejected, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the prosecution of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
Members refused to read the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which would have opened the doors to freedom for the currently imprisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymosenko was sentenced to 7 years in prison in October to conclude a disadvantageary priori agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must act on the appeal of the defendant in December.
Tymosenko qualified as the judge of political revenge of the regime and also caused a process of suspicion of the court's participation in the West too.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of the Criminal Law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
There would have been 226 votes in favour.
Libbyne Victoire
The liberation or rebellion of the Libyan people has already won.
Muammar Kadafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the vaccines.
As it is customary in the region, the electorate is Islamic, but it is modest or radical.
The National Provisional Council has deploreed the usual right of the Charia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight it's cut off.
Women may forget the emancipation, the non-compliance with her faith is liable to capital punishment...
This is the Qur'an that will unite the society of opposing tribes in the place of the dictator's personality.
In Libya it will regulate such an order as we cannot represent it and as we certainly do not love it.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted aid with the recognition of unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that this is not an American general who led NATO's attacks but rather God whom they celebrated the size of each attack.
So when it comes to looking for vaccinators in Libya, the accident doesn't happen.
We participated in the shooting, serving Islam and our politicians turned out to be the dictator as a political alliance without any benefit.
Following recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not dealing with Libya militaryly.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "Christians".
It is that without land occupation, oil companies will easily have access to the black Libyan gold.
Perhaps not so much and the accident will eventually result in a disinterested protection of human rights.
It's not enough to prevent these adjustments from being carried out.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A return to statistics has been made on Europe Tuesday.
Each State has published information relating to GDP for 3A.
The Czech economy has grown in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The mandatory market covers all records.
Investors not only look at Italy but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics offices in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have recently published their views on economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, with France by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better placed than planned (increased by 0.3% instead of 0.1%), but France was less than 0.1% (in the case of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter.
However, the GDP has grown and according to the Czech Statistical Office, it is confirmed that it is moving towards a progressive reduction in economic growth.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy has grown by 1.5% over the third quarter, but has grown over the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to the planned and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area economy and the European Union had increased by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what the analysts had planned.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year performance is 28.45 per cent
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is in the process of grimmering to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Czech obligations is maintained below 4 per cent while the situation is prevailing in the region.
Votes are being heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs are qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football performance has achieved its most difficult mission in the season!
In Montenegro, it has also been awarded thanks to the super Czech and the Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also defended a good part of the chance in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European champion.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a large part of the chance for the second.
The Czech representation has also been awarded thanks to the super Czech and Peter Jiracek hero with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The mounters were found under pressure until the second part due to a specific Czech defence.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucicic, who had two chances of marking a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Chech, the Czech representation will not be absent in the European championship next year, and more than 200 million crowns will be awarded in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes, we played a football fighter.
The two teams had difficulty mounting combinations and the game was concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national football players did not reach the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half of the period.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They've created a human butcher
A few hundred high school students have created a human bunker around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support this management the nuclear programme of their country in the face of a possible Israeli invasion.
The students started praying at noon before the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Spanish universities have created a madi human bunker around the Spanish nuclear technology center where the uranium is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend the nuclear programme of their country at the cost of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations was carried out in Israel.
The students started praying at noon before the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the site of Nathanz where the uranium is rich.
The feeding of an obese child: don't take breakfast and take care of the nursery for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of those who will take a weight above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a sick lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment is in which the human being and the models around it evolve.
In obese children's tables, for example, 50 per cent is more often than in children's families with normal weight.
19% of the obes had lunch fries according to the survey conducted with a sensitization action "Obesity is not a hazard"
In large families sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schools today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Investigation conducted over 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and attended 900 primary schools in Czechia.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a Hasard", action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from the sixth to the third were enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, obese, is the absence of proper food and not sufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children concerned, for example, indicate eating 5 times a day and breakfast - breakfast - dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner care
Specialists pay attention to the fact that healthy development requires some basic details such as a small family breakfast at the same time.
In Czech, only 23% of the students' families eat at my own hour.
In most families each has its own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been raised is that one tenth of the population doesn't take it from all breakfast.
The breakfast, however, is the basis of good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that more often in the families of obese children are consumed with malaise.
Nearly every student - without talking about weight - drinks every day of sugary drinks (70%).
More than 40 per cent of the children questioned regularly do sport, but for parents it is only 15 per cent, only 15 per cent.
Prepare Your Food
Another part of the survey has allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from offered opportunities according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of 12 to 15-year-old Czech children are far from the plan of a healthy, ideal food."
Among their favorite dishes there are plenty of cats, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for sugard lemonades," is indicated in the results of the survey.
To do this tomorrow are the dishes that took the first place in front of the white meat.
Children do not have all the tastes and preference for fish and legumes were very low.
Not on Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of participants in the investigation that had completed the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session "Obesity is not a hazard", a well-defined willingness to go to a healthy food has been demonstrated," the results of the survey.
The most outstanding was, for example, in respect of dried lemons because children began to give priority to water.
Children have most often cooked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce sugar and "knedliky" dishes (chokek specialty of bread or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say.
In a presentation article on how to learn for the stylists, I was a little upset at the fact that it had been there since the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The exhibitions of three specialty professionals, staffing and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.
And it'll be worse.
The more we approach final exams, the more we wait for practical exercises and information.
And even when there are summers and Sundays, it's really "bout".
This time we have with the Director of the Alenka (in the course there is no boy) a treaty on how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small knife, the other a boy's body, without a special curve, another of the surfaces.
The stylist must know how to optimally reduce large arms, extend a curve or pull necessary curves.
We are thus able to highlight the personality and also not to speak too much about the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong poitrine and pronounced jaws and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the angles in such a way that the jeeps or pants do not go all the way, it is worth measuring.
And you won't regret it because it's unappreciative.
In a jupe on a scale you will feel much better than in the one who wanders continuously, hangs and doesn't keep quiet and so on.
For those who have a male appearance, you can have a Tucker style dress, with haircuts, or even brothers.
There are, of course, many examples of different appearances, and I'm glad I've had all week to choose all the information I've received.
But I'm also afraid that I'm thinking about what I'm supposed to do at home there's too much.
Each stadium receives a celebration to celebrate for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality and its appearance.
I'm supposed to "habiler" Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know from the campaign the Secretary of Victoria.
In my mind, this makes me happy, because it's better to have Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took nearly 100 pounds of this last time (do not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or even young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and cut from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only has the physical but also creates, for example, the productive pages in the magazines (of products given the trends for handbags, handles, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphicist, we've been interested in all of this.
But it's... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three specialty invitations gave a different aspect to the Saturday meeting filled with information on the different types of personnel.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphicist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talent stylist can work with a single painting in a different way.
Variability is the prime example.
Like this trench-coat that has to be carried in a classic way with a jean and a t-shirt as a light handle, but it can also wear the body no, with scarpins and take it in photo as a dress.
Or it's enough to remove the gaps or the hill and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he pointed out.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work".
"You can then begin to oppose it," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, why, when we sometimes see something else in fashion magazines.
No statement on fashion deficits.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have a lot more fun than those who are photographed.
It is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be prepared to "retaliate" at least a fifteen.
Also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to deal with this during a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not a super singer, but her image and marketing made it a global star.
In Czech, the approach to the use of stylist services remains fragile.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I'm going to do in the second grade).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we must rely on the fact that he tells us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we stay on the google and make sure that the boulevard information is of the celebrity in question, if it has magic or grossi, etc...
HONZA and Mario put us on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to guide themselves in the fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he speaks and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to become people, not flak, to keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to choose his arm and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and tell him, "My God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things that you'll find nice and you'll advise him what to wear," said Mario.
This shows us specifically what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or stylist bag.
That's what you get around the size and you have on yourself for whatever you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as cyseals, depletion rolls, or even food pumps, there is also the nylon thread (which the stylist uses for photographing products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a cloth is closed in the dose, if it is too large (the pellets or other type of graph are not useful because they could cover the clothing) or a box.
So that we are not only people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly remember the shoes.
And during the photo sitting in the workshop where the surface is equal, the mirror could be displayed, fortunely on the left.
And that's how we collected and collected.
We did not have the right to touch the bones so as not to hurt themselves indiscriminately.
There is a real need for skills.
Mario made me happy when he thanked me for my creation.
The account I'm making is not for my wife.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second week of course.
I'm beginning to understand more and more that making a styling profession is not a walk in a rose garden, but everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is disputed throughout America.
Revision
In the beginning, a course without problem is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine shift to work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of each one, but it does not serve if no one wants to do anything more.
The new sub-titled part The Run produced great expectations before leaving.
He promised to take a new direction with the race series Need for Speed already aged and to get out a kind of game from players that would not only deal with points.
So we were curious how the passengers will be driven in the course of which the principal hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As this has already been done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole takes to the bottom because of some useless mistakes that have existed for many years.
This is not really a mistake, but rather the expression of incomprehensible finanity by the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're in an adventure where the principal hero Jack has some kind of problems and is involved in illegal courses through America.
You sit behind the flight to the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The timetable is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 courses.
As a result, each course takes place on another route and the steps envisaged in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel the only moment the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite beautiful even if the technical level is the same as the previous series.
After all, this is not the end of the world.
But the walking through the desert, in the fields of autumn or well in the highly enchanted mountains is very pleasant in sight.
The trials are increasingly time-adjusted by a typical element.
For example, in the desert you are found in a sandstorm that significantly decreases visibility.
Then in the mountains you need to be careful that an eagle does not fall above you.
On the other hand, the different courses are well organized behind each other.
There's only a small number, but that's enough.
There are moments when you try to overcome the number of enemies (such as in a classic course) and then run against the display (classic debt with the chromometer) and then wait for another pain with an enemy.
From time to time you also have the police who are in the game and who tries to make you the difficult situation.
The new is the passage out of the vehicle.
It's rather an interactive animation when most of Jack's time is burning in front of someone and you need to help him by tapping on the good button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, this element does not risk gender and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that like the game.
The model of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at the moment, but we can't say it's negative.
For realistic simulation, you should go see more.
But although we can find it better in competition, the driving model will be very well with the type of design of the courses.
So it's all right.
Problems begin to appear after some time.
In contrast to the behavior model, that of the collisions is not yet on the point.
We do not expect this game to be a complex deformation and collision, but when you do not have, when you do not have any object with the least idea of how your car behaves, that is not completely good.
During closed crossings you sometimes touch slightly slightly, but otherwise your car is part of a lot of people's volts.
Or it's a lie.
Thanks to the relaunching system, this is not really a problem, but it really bothers you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you hit the figure or you come out in the score of the game, you jump at the last point on the stage.
But you only have 5 recharges.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's another tool, for the case where something doesn't happen as necessary, something you can really count on.
Sometimes the reindeer doesn't help, and the solution needs to be found by remembering the internship in question.
The main feature of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain obstacles that need to be overcome in some way, but that is not the case.
Otherwise you will meet in a given location of "civils" vehicles today in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute later.
What angers this is the situation when you can easily pass the opponent between two cars coming in the wrong direction and when you arrive, you need to turn around and turn them away.
It's the same if you go before him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opposers still have other advantages.
Throughout the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without being interested in time, and you still have the same enemy that confronts you in the same place.
This gets the most upset at the end of the game when you roll on a long point in reverse.
The enemy must pass at all costs before you.
When it passes in front of you, he hides the view of other vehicles in reverse sense and you enter a good number of times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you are fast asleep.
And it's bad because through a simple behavior model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's the same if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routers, that the order of courses is that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change in the vehicle during the course of the race.
You need to pay attention to the passenger pumps because you can change from car to car, but most of the time you have enough.
The vehicles are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for right-wing cars and super sports cars for exotic athletes on high-tech roads, for example on skiing roads in the mountains.
And the way of challenges, which are courses in special places you know about the adventure, is going very well with the main system of history.
You receive not only medals but also experiences that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest level of driving, different objects begin to derail:
This connects online with the Autolog function which includes comparisons of your results with other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult times to understand is the situation of the last stage of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the Metro (like) where you roll in the dark on the roads (like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (at the top) and then you reach a metro frame that sends you the car directly to the railway.
In the editorial we had a discussion for a few days to find out whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really took us for impasses.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is strange is that in more extreme situations, imagination does not have the level and in some tragic cases.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image no longer serves you.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most popular, a new sound track was created in the style "I mix everything", but we can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
General impression of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
Love is really good, but prepare for the mistakes you've made in your eyes with the strength of an aircraft reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs act as negists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically eliminated the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect a war so hard."
"This will take 5.6 years before the situation calms and all players are in their new role," said Miléna Vicenova, who began his presentation at the University of Law to the Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such a way as to be understandable and visible, as a large number of speakers from the University of Charles's Law Faculty could send her, she showed how she took her "cognizable and open-ended view of Europe" seriously.
Mrs Vicenova respected Herman Van Rompuye's work, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that it is a fly, that it is a round-up, that it can't fulfill any mission, and I must say that it's all over the world because it has its role in perfection."
"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, well communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in response to the question, "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater flexibility of the Union's policy towards States, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from syrecky.
Mrs Vicenova has also made the agenda that has taken place and will live in a time closer to the European Council.
She qualified for the Czech Presidency two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the financial crisis, the gas crisis, or have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It qualified for the fall of the government very negative and damaged the picture of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is now very busy.
According to the words of Madame l'Ambassadrice, "the activity has fought its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve now.
The new Union's seventh budget, which becomes very complex due to the current economic situation, needs to be further approved.
As it would seem that the budget will be small and in terms of economies, which sector will have priority, which countries will be most assisted, at least, in the framework of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador mentioned her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like the abbreviations, the foreign words, the jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or round corners, huge bananas or no one has forbidden us to make syrickys."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and to see more of the Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at several paces awaits us
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
It is also disappointed to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The failure, she said, resulted in several factors, such as the fear of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a lack of support from the Czech side.
Another successful Czech Presidency then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polishs, Magyar, Slovaks come to me, this French says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is still doing this group of Visedrad?' and it is not of all joy."
According to Madame Vicenova, in the near future, there are new tough rules on budgetary policy that await the Member States.
This is the concept of a Europe at two paces, if it is not at several paces, which provides for rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institution."
First of all, he said that the countries that wanted him and those who did not want him would not remain in their territory."
"There will be many institutions like this and there will be a real Europe at two paces," expects Madame Vicenova.
It also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for all EU-wide impact topics to be discussed between all EU members and not just Eurozone members.
Mark history:
The IBM innovation begins in the second century of its existence
If someone had to search for the vocabulary that was the closest to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long-term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a strong feeling as very present and has been learned from its creation for hundreds of years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was rejected by the first head of the firm, visionsist Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems could be solved so that people would like to reflect.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the prince around which will develop the life of a future genius (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM started to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture that was carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived for hundreds of years because it remains faithful to its basic values and has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more," said the current director of firm Samuel J. Palmsano for the anniversary.
A Very Ready System
Watson, in the thirty years, has been busy with his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid holidays, an insurance paid by the employer more than an elegant employee form and a well-designed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way IBM has a well-designed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning of a great discovery of talent - as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus had the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman - Virginia Romeo - who should replace Palmsano to the head of IBM.
It has been working with IBM for thirty years and currently takes over the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and the Strategy.
In recent years IBM has done what is called jany, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations are generated.
It is not surprising that he has many ideas - in the firm there are about 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures its safe position in the areas of business.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economy at Harvard School of Economy and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business world problems using its technology," said Geogre Colony of the Consulting Forrester Research firm.
As the firm himself said, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is commonly called in the United States, was concerned about its slogan - for hundreds of years she grew up to become one of the world's largest firms.
Of course, it is the most popular technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, accommodation and services of the Council at the server's level of products to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings are the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found this year with $220 billion in the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in progress
This is not all innovations and manufactures that were preferred by the client and the time - IBM, for example, did not have the same effect on an operating system as OS/2, the Prodigi online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the time your business is built on the move in progress you cannot emotionally stay on the past," said Samuel J. Palmsano.
For this, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when it does not work it goes.
Unlike the Microsoft competitor, which is based on and remains under the Windows operating system.
A vision technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are designed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a pre-supposed position.
However, in 1990 it was with more than one reason for participation than the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets for $15 billion, which has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies over the period.
It continues to invest and even since 2008, when for the first time it has exceeded the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the requirements of its first leader, Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased its volume of investments during the major economic crisis.
Did it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
Since 2008, the price of the IBM action has increased by 120 per cent, the net profit of the firm continues to increase.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
That is why we can expect this flexible genius to master other crises.
IBM History: From brake brakes to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York 100 years ago; she initially had the complex name of Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
It bears the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a subsidiary of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the ninth century.
They owned technologies such as old "potential", pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was chairing the Society's Supervisory Board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competitor Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made the dream to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that still remain the identity and culture of society.
Watson runs the firm until 1952.
IBM, as he says his name, starts with the production of all possible machinery for business and trade - from brakes of cheese and meat to registered boxes.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the business figure grew to $9 million and began to expand in all parts of the world.
Watson was so ungrateful for the firm that after 40 years of leadership he was his son who took over the board of directors, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction IBM starts the development of artificial intelligence and develops the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the people and computers of IBM helped NASA guide flights to the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the moon.
In the meantime in 1964 IBM develops the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determines the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 comes on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but buys the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and starts to deal with advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that succeeds in IBM in the last three years is the concept of Smart Planet "a smarter planet".
Its objective is to make the technology smart in areas not yet implemented, such as the transport and management of cities.
For IBM's business area, a "Smart Trade" platform has been developed for a short time to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It created its subsidiary in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the Brno outsourcing strategic centre.
The Central and Eastern Europe Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also the global research and development team that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
If you can keep this year, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became the guardian of the body and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"The Pope may come home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova was married to an Asian woman in Bartosova in her home, she had no doubt that her husband would not.
When Iveta insists on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa doesn't rest the song.
And he publicly claimed he loved it.
With the time Darina was reappointed, she accepted her husband's connection and ended up telling him yesterday for ever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated, there will be no wedding to welcome her at the door of the house.
"It's my son's biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my dear and lost old man, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," he left to filter Rychtarova showing that she was divorced from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed his door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife has made a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"Darina and we are discussing perfectly normally, but we don't sleep together," said Rychtar to Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together, and he doesn't care where she goes, and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Is this also about you?
If you ask men to determine typical ways of women, everyone, like the others, are able to get them out of "their weakness".
My dear ladies, you will find out in the following lines of women's vices that come to pump the blood of men's veins.
The purchases
Does your half notice that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one suit per week?
Are you happy to buy and buy packages at the time of payments?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for buying.
But you're saying, who would stay in the wine bar of the clothing stores, find for themselves beautiful clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although most women buy a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting for the entrance...
Consistency is key
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need to migrate at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Please?"
Don't these words remind you of something?
Yeah?
So you're part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of people are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
The strong gender does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become disgruntled.
The order and property at the first place
It's like an endless shortage.
Wash the windows, pass the aspirator, clean the soils, dry the dust, waste the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make comments to your partner that he walks with salty feet on the ground, to the children who have gone out of the bathroom, crossed the roof of the living room, and what does that give you much work?
In the case where you suffer from this disorder, try to have in mind that there is nothing to exaggerate and that order and property should not be the first place in the family.
However, this infective desire of property can damage your relationships and even family peace.
The know-how
"But this survey used in the powder."
"Do you care to put these old shoes in the morning?"
"A hired servant has nothing to do with the earth."
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you will really miss it.
Of course, you don't think bad you want everything to be impregnable.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have done so much work...
The diffamation, the persiflage
Disfamation, persiflage, but also insults against someone are also the very ones of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and are thus happy to deal with issues such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us will let a small harmless persipation out here and here.
However, the hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persimmonize, even offend others, and are for their part - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jár and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The attacker Hokeyist Järr has twice participated in the victory of Philadelphia during the match of Monday NHL on Caroline's ice and is again in charge of the Czech players producing the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old Claude Giraux, who also made a further step and was appointed the best player of the match, he noted in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jár also recorded two goals during the match.
Jár after the match told other Italian journalists that he had warned Giroux that this would be a big evening.
"I told him before the match he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling fell upon you" explained Jár after his action Giraux marks a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
One moment later there was a second shot from the Czech team.
Voracek fights behind the Huricans' goals for the palace and presents it to Maxime Talbot butcher.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer was a drop, but the start of the second part belongs to Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Järr he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transforms a fourth goal.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league, but he's really part of the three best," said Järr about his center.
"I never thought I'd play a career with a hockeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL, the other team players tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Järr.
Caroline did a game of this game because with a goal of Tuom Rutu and again of Dwyer on a draw of criminality she ends with a difference of purpose.
Matt Read did not remove other complications that end up two against one.
"Proger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He fell on the deck, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cave.
"I tried to hit him and I got here," describes the last goal of the game of his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia has arrived with this victory in the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo in the second third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians did not face an experienced defender of their two objectives after a 2:3 execution.
Tomas Pkelanec has not turned any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was a disease that was mostly embroiled the local coach rather than lost points because they only played the match with 5 defenders.
"It's nothing."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," said Jacques Martin.
"Poverty on replacement is not enough and we have not been able to resist."
"Our planes just simplify the game, push the ball out of our area."
That's why we had limitations," added one of the defenders, Mr. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defence took part in the 30th Winnipeg attack and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters have participated in a bunch of Jets, who have stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices have evolved since 1989
By 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at this time offered trips especially in the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Socchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have an incentive for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechoslovakian people) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In the case where the citizens of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or in the Soviet Union, they needed an invitation letter but the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at this time also offered trips to the West, but it had to cook all night with a shower bag or have a "good knowledge" inside the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't yet won.
The agreement on dividends that were the condition of travel to the west was rejected by the "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovakian currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (the western currency) to travel west.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations in the country where there were many homes of campaigns and chalets that the Czechs had completed and this habit is still difficult.
The journeys of the Czechs have been a major revolution since 1989.
Although the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the highest in 1989, the Czechs last year spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world.
The great paradox we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of the Yugoslavia of the period.
The removal of visas in the 1990s in the neighboring countries of the West caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians were unable to travel by plane for a long time to the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
In Paris, for example, travel organizations slept in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical treat of a trip from Tcheques was at this time to import its own preserved food, sauce, etc. to save it.
Another important moment has also been the interchangeability of the Czech crown that has allowed our tourists to buy free of the Western currency for decades.
Our standard of living and the average wage increased what caused another important moment around 1997.
Since 1997, travel agencies have begun to prepare tours with air charters that have significantly reduced the costs compared to what has been previously done through contracts.
At the end of the last 90th century, the Czechs had open links with practically most developed countries around the world, apart from the EU, who later made our journeys easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-conflict tourism was when the first air charter was prepared to a exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since that year, as each year of direct air charters, Czech tourists from distant hot countries have been away; this winter will have 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
There are more than 100,000 Czechs visiting exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-conflict development, came in 2008.
on 17 November 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to participate fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in the history they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacations abroad, including the attached loads.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this risk of ending up in a situation without a "a pat" solution
Almost 5 months ago, the Czech football is no President, and Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Republic's Football Association was not yet known after a general assembly to be held in Nymbruk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules have to be made.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Pacli are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek gave his resignation in June, and during his departure he called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead the football in the future.
Only during the evening after Hasek the football went back to differences between the Association's rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
Delegations of the General Assembly met in Prague in vain at the National House because the negotiations remained closed and there was not even a question of how to deal with it.
There was no agreement on knowing who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only if it seemed that the statutory representatives or the officials had been invested in full power.
In this unique point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, which states that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences remain with regard to the electoral regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has nothing to do with the situation no longer.
Opinions on the possibility of vote have changed several times, but the nevralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The debate is based on the following fact: whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, which represents the professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, the third round of candidates who will have received the most votes in percentage within the room for which they are invited.
Moravia is ready according to what was said to withdraw to receive the candidate who will have received the largest percentage of votes in the two rooms.
And the Czech side studies the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the vote.
"Only this would have lost the idea of two previous towers and would have completely rejected the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, which includes the objections of the morava party and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote in accordance with the current statutes.
It is surprising that Thomas Paclik agrees even if he considers that the electoral rule established by the most favourable status of all candidates is Pelta.
"I want you to vote to the maximum according to the statutes of the association."
"Because there have not yet been any Sagren ideas imagined by a representative as during the previous General Assembly," said Victoria Plzen's owner who was first invited and who in his exhibitions was primarily defined against Pelta.
There's a lot of other optimistics left.
According to him in Nymbruk, there will be a new President and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future in a constructive and constructive way.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm the world."
"Football will be again on a favorable floor and there will be more training for cooperation," added Jablonec's officer who among the three has the greatest experience in driving football both professional and regionally.
Rajchl is more aggressive.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are trends in wanting to change the rules in design."
"This may again cause a blockade to the General Assembly."
"I hope all the same good reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should be held directly in Montenegro but can say if the entire football tour will be complete for the match.
The flight in which Podgorica had to travel between the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl had not been delayed for technical reasons and was sought for a variant to remove a part of the executive committee on the territory of the institutions.
Finally, it is the ministerial meeting, which could have a place of Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth and Sports Education, Joseph Dobes, would be very happy to receive the missing parties within the country's most powerful sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state-of-the-art provision, the credibility of football as well as the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sport, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacli's going to fight for President's position because he doesn't see any right candidate.
If the head of Plzen Thomas Pacli's football player had seen before the General Assembly, his profile would have responded to everything he requested for a new President of the Association of Football in the Czech Republic (AFRT) would not have been campaigned for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not present myself to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Pacli to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl in order to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that would be preferred for this election.
Pacli also points out that in the event of the election, he would only take this position of President until 2013 for a general assembly.
It would be good to be an experienced and high-level manager but not connected to the football world.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"It was terrible for me when some told me they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What was said, especially Paclik, was the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union of the Plzen Roman Berbr football, a man known as the controversial man known in the coalitions as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing more in the football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-fly merchant, it would be even less favourable to football," said Paclik.
What is still shocking is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a crime case, for which Pelta came out without any pain.
"I don't know what precious Pelta would bring to football."
"It's how we're serious about the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," says Paclik, who once said "if Pelta becomes President, I'm selling Plzen's club."
In the case where Paclik would triumph in the vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paklik before the September General Assembly, who had ended with a failure, thinks the same thing.
"The (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would be."
"The Heath of Great Capacity"
"It would be possible, for example, to present themselves as head of the representative."
"But as the manager of the Association, he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nose into what I don't know," says Pacli, who drew great attention in September when he announced his resignation to the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macella, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level of leadership of the Association.
He took, for example, his capacity to lead private firms and has also been leading the Plzen Club since last year, which has held its support in May in the first division.
"I have the power to change something in the sports world and bring it to a certain culture."
"I would like to ease the influence of some interested groups, for example, who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which leads to bad tastes," Paclik added, who does not blame his antipathy for the leader of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee with the power of lobbying to high-level policies to obtain more money for the sport of tax on games.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should deal with."
"If it's about gambling tax as stated by political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen Club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "top the parties".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I don't see any reason to transfer my actions from Plzen's club to someone if I have to come back one and a half years later," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT which should end the state of the country.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to President Miroslav Pelta promised that if he was elected, the AFRT would have new status to put an end to the electoral regulations in the future.
Jablonec's staff is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymbruk and believes that today's success in football should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election, has just promised to devote herself to national representation and financial means if he is elected.
He has decided to be a candidate at the latest just before the last General Assembly, and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of the guidance of football and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and wait for Thursday to have a president."
"They feel that it is the best time for someone to take the lead in the Association," he added, but first of all, he worked for a large number of years in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
It is believed that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Happyly to the June General Assembly of Statutes has been approved which were not as perfect as all have been seen."
"If there had not been all these different interpretations, we would already have been a President since September," said Pelta.
It is just the revision of the most important document of the civil association that has taken all the attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as my personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities in the event that this does not go."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries not to face his enemies.
He stated earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he knew clearly that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't been attacked for a long time, Tonas Paclik has not stopped criticising Pelta.
"He's evolved into football for a year and has already succeeded."
"These attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also because some now have doubts about its character," Pelta said to his opponent, but remains faithful to the statements he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level of competition to the national representation.
This should be a football speed.
"I would also try to end all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the result of the scandal of corruption."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said the Czech Press Agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of the football would not change people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said to Strahov, where he has a understandable nervousness since he has no leadership.
Although there have been disaster scenarios with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not be in Nymburg for anything.
"If there's only one point of dispute about how to vote in the third round, we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and he will only get it when he has a new leader," said Pelta in an optimistic way two days before the most likely day for his career.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would start working hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected the new President of the Czech Republic Football Association to the "General Assembly of Thursday, this would not be the case for a large number of people, he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the event of his election, we will begin to work hard.
He wanted systematic changes and the members of the Executive Committee were responsible for various aspects of football.
He also promised to regulate the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work initiated by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football all over it."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a successful football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I would like to share competences within the Executive Committee so that each member is concerned with a specific area."
"And I would distribute difficult missions to make football a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because they will have to start working hard rather than criticize others," he added.
It has been said that it would not be represented as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"As for me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if that's worth the cut and if I'm going to have people behind me who will keep my legs in the wheels and raise doubts about each of my actions," he said.
"Many people have the same thing to say that I don't have to give up because they're also going to give up."
"This is a confidence I can't betray," he said.
What motivates you to continue the work with Hasek.
"There has been a great deal of work since the last two years and I don't want to let it fall."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years, and I would not like to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not return as it had been before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"The Lord finds people who would make football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been chosen."
"We can approach a number of things but certainly not to support something."
"I'm trying to be a target."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone in the world will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he reaffirms once again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"If there's anyone who says the opposite, I'm ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts into one Czech and the other of which the grapes would be found in the first division."
"There would be no situation like the present with only three mobile teams in the division, because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Thomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for President's position, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I have always felt a support from the Czech Chamber that has elected me Vice-President and I know there will be success with me," said Rajchl, who thinks of his future success to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contracts negotiations with televisions and the game law.
On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association was not united was a common mistake to all.
While he said about Pelta "he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility," he believes that the second opponent of Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer the football.
"No one can doubt Plsen that he has done a great job this year."
"If he were elected he would certainly continue in what has been started by Hasek and would not make significant changes among the people in the Commission."
"He wouldn't want to win his success," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A sand in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Ovni optical pathugers, magnificent swimming pools in Budapest: Who travel through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning around the city or making a long walk - he can leave his legs tired in gas baths.
A book shows what birth pool you can experience most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his bags: his bathroom email.
On his back in the water, she observed the artificially arranged couples, and she went to meet the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not miss to admire the Art New mechanically restored from these transformed swimming pools.
If a covered swimming pool was pleasing to him, she noticed in her cart without delay all the precious details of interest on the type of building and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were sent in this way by the history of Meder architecture and presented them in its already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The town-covered swimming pools of Münich, historical bathrooms in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete" in Taunus.
It has carried out its "most exceptional trips to central Europe" in 13 countries. Along with Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it has visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
46-year-old Germany is a true fervent of the culture of the bathroom.
Meder, explain that she has little interest in sports, but he feels drawn to water in a completely different way.
It's a shock that the birth supporters should be happy to see blue careers and get comfortable with Javel's water fan while players breathe from perfume by sending spy forests or can listen to the gasping of happy birds in the park.
"I've been asked one day why the pools must always be if you're mad," said the vinnoise.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
Water surface twice strengthens architecture
A swimming pool and volleyball sauna oil - a factor of well-being in the nativity rooms are enormous because all senses are aware of, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "In place of a floor there's a surface of water in the living rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but reflects on the other side, however the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are present in a double way: high volumes, multicolored squares, templins.
The small image volume "Badefredent" makes a report of 190 pages of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the axis of the historical well-being - it certainly wants to heal in the blue.
The collection of Meder discovered remarkable examples during his research in Hungary.
On the other side of beautiful well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural garden in Miskolc-Tapolca and a hot bath filled with water containing alcali and (Városio Termáflürdö in Jaszberäny) and located in a bottle-like building.
On the other hand, the fully air-conditioned swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. As soon as a shower of the Zürich pool is all over the city, we can admire the Arlberg built from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath is surrounded by a window from which we can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits the nagers in Langgenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal is similar to an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from three open plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal ascend to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel's water does not attract all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths consist of a sour smell, from the Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba, a strong oil smell, which is hard to believe, to find in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon collects you to the skin as soon as you let you swim in the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also made discoveries: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and in full air from Czechoslovakia, she found herself in a barricated area.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was inter-times closed.
Turning an eyebrow through the window of the New Art furniture in red-white-young, she observed the spread of bad trees among the cars.
She observed an opposite effect in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only by the neo-Roman elements that have come out of its design in 1844 but also by the Alhambra style room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its sudden modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the popular bath of the expert in swimming, Iris Meder - and not just because it is the original of Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance than to build construction styles if different in a unit so formidable," says Meder.
With such a palace, the floor in the thermal pool appears to be only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on the first matter
De Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up its speculation on the first material?
According to SPIEGEL-Online, Joseph Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group wanted to see the consequences.
Hamburg-
For citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks rely on such primary materials as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions to continue this business venture because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the organization of feedwatch consumers.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the focus of the Boards on the first global subjects, puts the prices up to the top, and that banks share a complication in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign specifically deals with the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
The speculation on the raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
However, the majority of experts share the view that the couples have been involved in offers and demand - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism of American competitors: He promised to investigate the claims and said, "No matter is worth playing the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL Online, an international working group is currently considering the allegations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, habit.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences of the withdrawal.
It could result in a reduction in the market of raw materials, or even a complete decline.
Ackermann built his Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms to the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows a particularly dramatic way in which today's banks fall into general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today especially under obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the positions of its portfolio, for which the money was invested on food supplies," Bode said.
"This is a small amount, for Mr Ackermann, whether it is a question of the disabled or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is in play."
Ackermann's awareness may appear to be the first surprise, but it is clear that the group's PDG wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the President of the Board of Directors would not change anything within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with the absence of disputed agricultural speculations.
And with regard to possible losses, he didn't want to worry about them - his successor will worry about them.
One of the two would resiliate the placements on the first material.
Foodwatch tries to keep a strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 internationals have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published Mardi's survey, with which the Institute of Forsa conducted interviews with 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 percent found this legitimacy that the Deutsche Bank has proposed placements for which the prices of food products have been paid.
Many bank clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one would resiliate, followed by the survey, all the positions for which the money is injected in the specifications on the first items.
43 per cent would have taken over such a bank around them, 49 per cent would have answered that they would reflect on the resiliation of their accounts in order to change the banking structure.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, bass and Happy End: the Austrian palace for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prices, was a museum in Vienna, was left empty and then fell to the ground.
It is now reopened and has an exhibition house.
If we are excited about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its living and audacity and its new building materials that are typical of faith towards technical progress, then the role of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for Brussels's universal exhibition in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilon has also received the "Grand Prix of Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, light and suspension.
The construction is considered to date as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary house at four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in Munich, it finally became famous at international level in 1973.
Its project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Garden of Switzerland at the southern corner of Vienna, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically adapted to a museum - not walls to expand art works, so it was not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long, until modern art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become more and more detached.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now transformed the Pavilon, now bearing the name "Maison of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvedère museum opened, where the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance drop at any point of view.
The new start was well conducted by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedère in 2007.
Husslein-Arco has promoted an art historian to a significant career among others in his youth of artistic patents, then at the Guggenheim Museum, and as the founder director of the modern art museum of Salzburg, she has carried out in particular the transformation work with political men and the protection of monuments, has obtained public funds and private sponsoring and has established the operation.
Except the contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exposed, a coffee and a library are found, and an office must be built there.
strict monitoring, small budget
So for the Kristianitz realization was the perfect interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity Joseph Olbracht's secession and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at Vienna's Technical University and that for him the pavilion was “a very important place” where he had seen the exhibitions “mostly every week-end”.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and ease after moving to Vienna and by changing its use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: "building was "a power goofphre", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass panes were changed, the isolated glass reinforced in glass fibres was put and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges were strengthened or replaced, and the refurbishment was rehabilitated.
Two subsoles have made the place of the new operation, a light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it is almost a new building, but still the light Pavilon Schwanzer.
The external doors of origin are left, the house is painted in a protective tent against the red-brown colour wheel.
And the cinema room is exactly the same as what it was sometimes.
All of this is under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Many of the materials that are good and little should be found, and who also like the monumental protection office," Krischanitz said, drawing attention to a red soil in the sun.
Despite all the obstacles, problems and transformations, the building remains simple and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "who came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such a architecture is found "all day in the wrong place" and yet wants to "be aware of the good conscience".
But in this case, the 21st century House is not located in the wrong place, because it is a chance of urban construction: around Jardin Switzerland the "Central Park Square" is just the newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance will probably happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the encouragement of another Kristianitz building, because the collection of Francesca von Habsburg purchased the centre of Berlinian temporary art, and as he said, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Garden of Switzerland.
Bahn plans a real winter crisis in millions.
The railways company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid summer train accidents.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the company will spend more than 70 million additional roads this year.
The "Bild"-Zeitung daily reported to the press by calling for an internal crisis plan in the group, which would cover investments of around 300 million euros by 2015.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks also in the case of extreme temperatures.
The number of internal and external employees for the decommissioning of railway facilities and which should be doubled and passed to 16,000 people.
The objective is to clear up snow and ice up to the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the services necessary for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, Head of the Rüdiger Grube, maintained the government and industry during a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter, the company of railways had a huge problem for the transport of users, because it lacked other reservations in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is also the case for many new regional trains for years to be authorized by the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The road company has been doing this for years, since it has had to check the ICE train axles more frequently at the workshop, after an ICE crash took place in the central port of Cologne.
Germany's Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines to the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is again in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay for an increase of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this sector's genoiner has reached more than US: the Institute of Frankfurt pays $145 million (106 million) to resolve a difference due to the failure of five major co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator brings to large banks a series of charges, which would have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
These documents have lost enormous value during the financial crisis and have led banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied that we can find a solution to this issue without the parties agreeing to a court procedure," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has recognized no errors in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed itself to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. co-operative banks and intervenes in case of failure in order to protect client deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damages of several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other large banks in part and has been assigned to the JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Regarding the issue of mortgage documents, it is called "Mortgage-backed Security".
Credit houses are on the ground.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. Lehman Brothers Investment Bank collapsed.
Even though events have been happening for a few years, he is currently suffering from a storm on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have sought numerous remedies to recover or punish shortcomings.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the largest complaint case.
It refers to 18 large international banks, two U.S. state-owned finance firms, Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac, to being beneficial in business mortgages of about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also has to deposit an application to the FHFA for several operations of $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank rejected requests as unjust and claimed to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases from 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the financial backbone, invests Colossal sums in the IBM company.
Since March, he has purchased operations for a value of more than $10 billion.
Until then, the great American investor Warren Buffett explains without delay not to invest in IT computer companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only appears to be bad predictions.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
It had already come to understand much earlier than IBM offered services and information systems for other IT sectors.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered an attack on horses in the financial world.
As a result, IT IBM is entitled to call it "Mr IBM".
Car Buffett has now revealed to the CNCBC's economic emissions, which he has purchased since March of the IBM operations of $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM has never done anything about this commitment until now.
He welcomed the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM has been spending some time on IT-profit services as a "exploitation of accounting centres.
The information pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consultancy as well as very effective business calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He said he only invests in businesses where he understands business.
But Buffett is rather attacked by railway freight, lubricant manufacturers or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 branches as well as parties to a series of large groups such as the Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Municipal Rück.
This 81-year-old octogene had recovered in the 1960s" the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and had grown to one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to intelligent investment.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why it's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His mind is almost incapacitated to earn money, he valued the nickname "Omaha's Oracle."
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM's actions increased from one hundred to one hundred to a quarter.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a total worth of over 220 billion dollars and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, say Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "sangling ideology", which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000-2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkey population reacts with fear and concern.
Because for many Turkish brothers, the spectrum that has been believed to be dead for a long time has been reborn: since Mölln's fire attacks in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence compared to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
There was a genophobia in Germany, however, there was never a question.
However, the extreme right network that has been detected reveals the proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"It's a return to the bleeding ideology," "That was the title of the Internet corruption of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper pointed out again that one of the authors would have been a human being in the protection of the Constitution, and was concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bourbon.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend a silent reminder of victims of racial violence in front of the gate of Brandenburg.
This is not just two weeks before the Turkish Community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had considered a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey Recruitment Agreement.
It's with funny colors that co-habitation had been staged, symbolizing a successful history.
The reports of some Turkish media are the effect of a gifle: "the German gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of deaths.
Also, Germany's appearance of "Hürriyet" does not hesitate to remove the unique conditions.
"it begins to cry," that is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
It was pointed out that people would have been killed, paid taxes and contributed to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The police action was perceived very critically on the German-Turkey forums, and these were subsequently discussed with the success of their research.
Because it has not yet come to the attention of the German authorities to do research in certain areas of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one shows ready to at least some drastic rhetorical means: "If the case continues to be built, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defence and arms."
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany is strongly dependent on the quality of information and the relevance of the entire network punishment," writes "Selen".
What this means is if internal peace in Germany is in danger, Mölln and Solingen's attacks in the 1990s have been well explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen's fire is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on what hatred and distance by acts of violence could result.
However, the attacks have made us feel at home in the Turkish community.
Never repeat mistakes of the past
At the same time, it is particularly the case of German policy after the attacks by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the Turkish state, he represented the funerals in Cologne by his Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time of his speech, how much taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how much the ambiguity of many German-Turks has been deeply towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and reevaluate extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is this time needed.
Zürich Lake Scandal Bank
The most adventured Bank of Europe is not found in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and has suffered from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After its spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that it would take almost a spectacular position in 2013: President of the Council of Administration of the large Swiss bank U.S.A. - a large step towards an unexpected and successful career.
Axel Weber was publicly happy, greeted; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recent strength and made excellent comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has won the Turnaround."
"I'm happy to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
However, since September it was clear that everything would change.
A UBS securities trader in London had turned all the Bank's security systems and had flashed around EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, head of UBS Management Board, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the President of the UBS Board of Directors has been regarded as suffering - and all ask: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be consulted from the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the administration's presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank communicated to him.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
It is not banking, much more economic professor and bank president, and it would certainly need a period of adjustment.
It then assumes the responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has been proving once more that it has long merited the title of "the largest bank in Europe's scandal".
In fact, the UBS is on an enormous side - up to the last time, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, it has been suffering for years from a scandal to another.
Nothing seems to separate his Swiss high bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and strong, but also stolen, was combined with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the area of banking investment.
So the UBS would manage on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an empty client than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the link of the world's largest banks.
That's what impressed me.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor in Zurich for many years relates: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, we ask: how could I simply miss this point?"
He was deeply deceived.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something would not turn around to UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which was so far considered to be an intellectual and great banker.
A few months later we heard why he was a party.
The Bank's division had flagged with sub-primary documents and had to cross billions.
To reduce this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a rise above.
For this, it actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have faced the sources: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed in silence, where it had never even been taught its name.
That was not the first time.
In April 2008, that was the case.
The bank had to reassess the losses of billions, the President of the Board of Director Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second Board of Directors of Switzerland's best pay.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS found itself, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the failure and was saved by the State.
The National Bank has acquired UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation has provided six billion francs for convertible obligations in action, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been cut off - because she noted how dramatic this may be for a small country, to open up such large banks.
Finally, the total UBS 2007 balance sheet rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said the banker, Geiger.
After the first disaster, he was followed by the second.
A few months ago, UBS had been arrested for a tax dispute with America and was declared ready to publish the client's data, which might have broken the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - compensation for unfair benefits resulting from these operations with an increased amount.
The UBS has thus published more or less that it has helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the reward of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the Head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors.
And from the client's cash issue.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main sectors of business: bank investment due to poor speculations and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a little bit of a return to peace, and as it was thought, the UBS would come out, he followed this unfortunate story of title brands: a single brand-named lamp of 1.7 billion euros, before the bank appears that something would not turn around.
And it is published: the management of investment bank risks does not always seem to work.
"With the case of Aboboli, we have found that the risk master is too small," said Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich Banking.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The UBS's problem is that it has no control over the risks."
However, it was precisely the idea of wisdom, with which Swiss bankers had long been working, that of becoming a guardian of the world's great fortune: not too much risk, but the security of money - and the world could well drift beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' treasures have become the symbol of inexhaustible reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS centre in Zurich will still match the strong click of the Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the central bank of Zurich, which runs directly from the central station at the lake of Zurich, which is surrounded by the enchanted summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Bijots such as Tiffany's, are found here among Swiss traditional stores all like those of the Sprüngli concierge.
Since the centuries of Swiss bankers have lived here: from the National Bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the UBS entrance hall with a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, there are sheets of leather sheets, and beside the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other out of the market - or it has the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a Swiss private bank is.
He would not want to read his name in the newspaper, as all Swiss bankers do business with the two big banks.
UBS would have become too big, especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would be in another resurgence.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And at the same time, they have long been adapted to the masters of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was actually the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then lost: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-primary jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
The disaster occurred on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the biggest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book The UBS crash.
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, political men agreed to save the big bank from failure.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks concluded a large group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for little Switzerland - and registered without delay an increase.
What helped was that the two different UBS pre-emptive banks had completed: a rich bank, but in litigation with a strong asset management point in Zurich and a more poor one, but some already strongly internationalized.
At the same time, international investment banks have had a great deal of access to money, with which they have been able to turn into a huge route.
Two names are associated with the U.S. Ascension: Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 Head of the U.S. Group, and Marcel Ospel, another president of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has broken a path to the summit with bank learning."
But Ospel would be trusted until the end of Wuffli.
And Wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the absence occurred before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word of order: destroy Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
It ordered the "League Tables" classifications, which at this time documented the success of banks.
After all the UBS wanted to mount everything up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
It played a very important role in debt and securities transactions.
However, business consultants, who were responsible for it, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the "Fixed Income" banking garage, there would be a huge difference between the largest banks.
UBS would have weaknesses at the level of American mortgage products.
To offset this gap, the UBS was launched into an adventure, which almost cost his life.
As regards growth, it is as well the bank itself as a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-primary positions that have invested.
She turned into a massive machine that wrapped up and passed valuable documents based on American mortgage loans - but also maintained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
"In the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the banker expert.
The bigger the euphoria, the more the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to start, when he ended the attempts, it became more difficult than we thought.
Posts in the U.S. have become more efficient and are still banking.
The one who manages the big bank has an almost impossible task.
There must be a strategy for a bank, for which all proposed business models have disappeared.
The banker, Geiger already has an idea: put a term on the investment bank, focus on the management of goods, return to the Swiss races.
But the bank doesn't (yet) want to go too far.
But the investment bank must be actively attracted, as this is clear until now.
The next player, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italy was only supposed to be a transitional when the bank was suddenly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it was imposed: UBS's business must be carried out continuously, and the Bank of Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the developing state in the 1990s.
The 3500 jobs year.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
With what does she want to win money?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has already asked.
He said to the public so far only that he and his wife would search for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

American investors expressed themselves in a sceptical way: "We are not an island, against its dependant "," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there will also be other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CBC.
As a result, it was too early to invest in obligations arising from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw an old principle into the wind for several decades and entered the American technology industry.

Intelligent corals thrive in cities
In many places, flies are considered as "flying problem" but experts say that these very smart animals will no longer be able to escape from cities for a long time.
Some loved ones, others want to get away from them as quickly as possible. Cornels have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents are multiplied because of the salt and the noise of the animals.
An antidote to " bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesic symposium on the corneals, experts said that it is no longer possible to cast the leaves of the villages.
The experts from all Germany discussed possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities
The protectionists of nature were also based on the issue of particularly protected forests: The use of chemicals in agriculture further destroys traditional vital areas.
The hunt, the arrangement and the destruction of typical cotton trees made life difficult for the birds.
The crowns are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couvian couples in the Westfälische Sost, in the north-west of which Jever, Diepholz and Achim are near Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had received negative publicity due to the cornal massacre in the region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in caves and their killings with particularly brutal gordins.
"The normal expulsion, the adventure, is nothing," observed the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of the nests by means of water under pressure or by beating trees often results in adverse effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the great colonies split and spread in other places."
The event is not imaginary but in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer destroy them."
The problem will not be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Major Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceived is a combination of the evolution of animals to an aversive condition and increasing supply so that they can be reinstalled.
Psychology and ethnology, Uta Maria Jürgens looked at "the information panels at the throne" in order to establish a completely different relationship with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a single dose of confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Education-Educational Corveilles in Schleswig-Holstein, where road panels inform about the life of these very intelligent people.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legible: The muscles use not only working instruments to reach a rule but they make their own tools as working instruments.
Cambridge University ethologists tested four fresh ones recently, where birds' intelligence comes from.
In an experience, birds quickly learned that they had to cross a rock with rocks to reach a well.
Without much training, they recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to spread the platform.
In a second test, the astute corals should then solve a problem later.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small sheet with a sheet.
The birds could not reach their nest with their beak.
The researchers, however, had put the thread blades on their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the little sheep of the little sheep.
Three of the four frequencies have been successful since the beginning.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, aims to invest billions in China in the coming years and will double almost the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees as a result," announced PDG Bill McDermott to its clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The effectiveness has grown from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader of business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Pékin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of 176,000 world SAP clients are in this country in full expansion.
The growth plans in China are also an important element of the 2015 Dax Group Strategy.

Currently the management of software provider business, which employs 55,000 people, has never been marketed as well.

"Now, we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by full information."
The reduction of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Chagrin: an intimate story of the First World War), he begins with a long list of characters that closes your heart.
Tip to start: carefully discard this page and make your page mark.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this Roman tale of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a budget during these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and disappointed in the outbreaks of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel laureate price.
He wrote here a book outside the community that he described, with accuracy, as "an ancient book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and materials is available.
This is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like" is found in the words "feels, impressions, experiences and humors."
"Pure and chagrin" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, young and botanists on scalers, passing by doctors, ambulances and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, become dust or lose their lives.
Their lives here are vaccinating like the graves of a church: while some are evicted, there are new ones.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It is a disappointment to the idea that World War I is only a reflection of the terrible war on the western front.
"Pure and chagrin" is well described by other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, the Mesopotamian and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the streets; a Christmas passage in Egypt under the pyramids; the dried motifs are an intrepid problem.
This book is loving from the first page.
The war engulfs the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina that can cut the cord.
When canon cuts are held far, and you're a mother in the fold, are you staying or are you running?
Who'll come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been overcome by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the chagrin" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English food in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young seaman of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memorabilia, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrible or passionate, but they are more preserved by the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address privacy and the ability to get out of it.
Describing the history of a German school, Peter Englund writes: "Erastz, everywhere you are."
"Café for replacement, non-aluminium failure, caustic imitation, paper bands, wood bottles."
It continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes the "wine made of broken leather in the fat of mouton (and ends with a false bone of wood); the tobacco made with dried roots and the dried skin of soil; the seeds of cassava in wood."
He claims that "837 authorized substitute meat is registered in the production of sauces, 511 substitute coffee is also available."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own pulse towards the rescue and says about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were destined to do, instead of sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky hand, reading a newspaper or a best seller, and rather than claiming that such a vernis is a symbol of civilization, and that there is no barrier behind your started and closed path.
In other words, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When we are destined to sacrifice, we hope to have a public," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a man convicted in secret".
Other observations relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of soil.
"The conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between cars."
He came to the conclusion of what he called "a new species within the beast of the beginning of the century: the well-artified and convincing mass killer, in well-dressed clothes, who runs his mouth while sitting behind a counter."
People act in an unexpected way; there are both basic behaviours and heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried at any price to capture a vengeful disease among prostitutes in order to avoid service to the front.
"The greatest expression in the trade of gonorrhea is found, that soldiers buy and rely on genetic organs in the hope of ending the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate of them apply it to the eyes, which is translated by a living quote."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's process is simple but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of short-term scenes, he learned how the war has "declared the only uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, a threat to religion."
People start asking why their leaders make war on them.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "In the West nothing new", by Eric Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most exciting I have ever seen in a non-fictional work.
I wouldn't reveal it.
But it's as if it came out of his book, get out of your hands this page where it's the list of people and burned with an alllumette.
After a first failure, a minutely planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some carrying anti-emergent cases.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be more cheap.
The operation is secreted by all threats of some senior officers and other information from the beginning that they were to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges of the Police Department.
There could not have been repeatations of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of dust gas against demonstrators, which are opposed to the department's regulation and have generated a threat of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti park of its exhibitors was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared to observe the completion of employment in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against evictions - anti-terrorist measures that are rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held last Monday night, on the east River side of Manhattan.
The orders for moving into the park came " in the last minute " , said a habit, referring to the operation as " a simple exercise " .
"The few police officers I know and who were called didn't know they were going to the Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"Only to know that they're going to be there is the summit of the Police Department's hierarchy."
The city has a lesson from the operation's secret.
On the last 14 October, police wanted to clean the park, but they were repatriated by hundreds of known plan-makers.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the area - dozens of officers used in particularly criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, as migrants. So an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park counted the least of the people," he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spot and speaker equipment gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan bridge, before intervention.
The light and message recorded by the speakers seemed to scare the demonstrators.
While community business officers were in the park equipped with their clear blue wind, many demonstrators simply collected their cases and were involved.
No attempt was made before 1h45, which left the time for the employees to collect their cases.
Other police teams were on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the head of the Police Department's spokesman, stated that this measure had been taken only by security.
But after a number of journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing intervention inside the park, badly held by the officials.
Mr. Browne said that the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the west through the space of the exhibitors' business spaces, including luggage, plastic gas, and filled-in sheets of clothing, the crew of the cleaning department followed, cleaning everything that the employees left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to leave were trained. Images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop in a methodical manner.
A dozen people in the camp centre have been added together.
Finally, two people were dressed in trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called to cut the chains.
There was no arrest in the park before 3 p.m., said Mr. Kelly.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
the majority for " public and rebel trouble."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the oldest officer to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, "he wouldn't run the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were suffering along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, where necessary.
Baricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a patio of houses in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street in the south.
We saw the Police expand the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti park.
Several officers, the majority of the vocabulary teams, would even have been seen moving people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night was in the south of the park.
At 5:00 a.m., in the south of Pine Street, a exhibitor jumped over the head of a police car. Others were seen climbing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a wave of opposition arose by flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a manifestant were hospitalized.
The union of school aids continues the city for licences
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that have lost their employment last month, plans to attempt to secure a trial in the city for unnecessary and discriminatory licences. The impact is disproportionate to schools hosting disadvantaged schools.
The follow-up is probably the last weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the licences.
Six hundred and sixty-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees, who were part of the least paid part of the city, lost their employment on October 7th. The union leaders compared these licences to a political sale so that the city would not have access to a health fund led by working groups, which would have been able to close the budget gap at the latest.
The municipal authorities have not categorized this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott stated that the licences were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied that the school aid licences were not specific to the budget.
The officials of the 37th District Council stated that they would submit a claim notice, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to formally announce judicial proceedings to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department will be the defence party. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of them black or from Latin-American origin, like most of the school aids that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the City's Legal Department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a survey of complaints received by the New York Times, the union would miss out on the number of schools in the most disadvantaged districts in the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular funding.
While there is no license on Staten Island, and some in prison in Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five eight schools employed at the 36th public school in Harlem, where 68% of the students live in poverty, they continue to say, "It's not a single parent's neighborhood that can earn funds to compensate for the lack of budget."
The budget of the 36 public school has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student registration.
The union also claims that the leaders of the strike could have been mistakenly induced by certain terms in a memorandum allowing parent coordinators to be licensed.
The memo used the term "extraordinary" to describe the action, even though "extraordinary" more generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the project of complaints, "six-six parent coordinators were licensed", and "not only because of excess".
Mission completed: Congress finds an agreement on the issue of Libya
Finally, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats had found an agreement in the Chapter on the issue of lifting in Libya.
There will have been a successful lifting, arrest and death of long-term dictator Muammar Khadhafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations will have to take a next Tuesday decision, supported by President John Kerry (Democrate - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republikain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independant - Connecticut), praising the Libyan people for their revolution and the American troops for their "religion".
"This resolution is to respect the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's a part of their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
Since then, both parties' legislators have entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited employment of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was won by a broad bipartisan margin and never made a vote in the Senate.
However, on the same day as the draft bill, the House of Members also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of American operations in Libya.
The American mission is therefore remained in a legislative purgatoir form - Congress is sufficiently opposed to criticising the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The Indication of the Congress was exceeded by the events.
Tripoli fell under the resurrections in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Committee ' s resolution on Foreign Relations " commends the Libyan people for their courage and their extraordinary determination for freedom" and " commends the men and women of the American armed forces and their partners of the coalition engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the United States' national interest in achieving an irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the Commission's support for foreign affairs of the Senate or will it divide the legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Commission, Richard D. Lugar (Independant), was opposed to the last version.
His speech last Monday said that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week for an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of the Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginie) will constitute the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a vote to appeal to the House or to the Senate.
Other legislators have not so far been able to approve their amendments, but this is not without attempting.
The Goodlate amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recursive - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are minor variations of a previous one.
At least 15 versions are available to the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another item that " would control federal expenditure " .
Some of these draft laws are identical, but they support them - especially the new Republicans who want to pay their CVs - the chance of becoming the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control (Budget Control Act) Act, approved in August last, called for the House and the Senate's vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which members of the Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrate - New York) wishes to limit the two mandates for the Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrate - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other things.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is continually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the team.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if the two-thirds of States are opposed.
Assuming that they were members of the amendment, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at 110th.
The cadence slows down as early as the 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but Not Battual" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first interview from the Fusilade
Ten months after an armed man shot him on his way to Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate - Arizona) appeared on a television show last night, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and said he wanted to come back before he returned to Congress.
When he appeared in the "20/20" newspaper on the ABC chain, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The emission reached its difficult return to the whale that broke its skull and crossed the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote in favour of the text on the ceiling of the debt.
During his first television interview since January, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang - and qualified for his "hard" recovery.
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "very well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and his husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, took place in a special edition of an hour of "20/20", which opened the door to the release of the new book "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special issue has delayed the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the fall of 8 January.
In the videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he was seen on his bed in the hospital, his head shaved and a broad scarf on the front.
She is able to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors learn to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "Quii."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords quoted another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: is the representative seen singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wwana Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said she didn't remember the fusion.
According to her husband, she was reading an article on the shooting of 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, was detained in a Missouri prison and was actively treated while awaiting trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Stop, stop, stop."
On his return, Mark Kelly said to Diane Sawyer, "I've been beaten."
"Then I would say, "Gabby, you haven't been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You were just massacred.
And you're gonna get out, get back and come back stronger than ever.
More love than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for the free Veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, marines, pilots and Marines around him.
The people in custom-clavate stood on their feet to arrest him.
"Military men, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fund collection.
A high military rank present in the Gala, who also participated in Amaltar Mike Mullen, head of the U.S. Army Army, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a sort of orphanage," wrote the military senior in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But that wasn't respect.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the military and a passionate American public often.
Praises are offered to the crowds for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they say a few soldiers.
The public acts more and more as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not all victims," declared Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to heal ourselves in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear unrecognizable or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of Vietnam's rebel forces has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on the pie took place in all privacy among the Veterans.
After his two sons returned from the war with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would observe them with respect because they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant contrabands.
Others would ask whether "a veteran in anger and violent hiding under the surface" declared Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some people who were making him pass his interviews asked subtlely whether he could keep the stress under the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return to the battle.
"When you discuss the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he spoke to his sons.
The military's difficulties arise, in part, from the American differences in wars.
Victims are rarely welcomed by such a small country as the army, which sees little direct benefits of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value the heroism of the same way as for the Second World War " claims Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the commendations of political men and of the people are widely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The groups are recognised for the number of periods of service spent, the number of friends lost or the spread of injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to fight violence
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will proceed against the army for alleged violence inaction.
If so, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the next one.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was born 11 weeks old on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008. She went to her home at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having met a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a bag of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room to drink a glass.
"C" was a alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put her anxiety aside.
I thought, no, he was 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after she entered Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her behind, kicked her by the ground and raped her, claiming.
This week, November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other soldiers, some still serving and others not, will eagerly await the decision of justice during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of the violence within the army, thus meeting the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 months later - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or abused sexually by military colleagues. They also claim that the army has not investigated, continued or provided appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's taking the galloned soldiers because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of repressives? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February almost 400 other survivors have been contacted, most of which could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all its eggs in the same panel - it will try several processes, if necessary, to keep pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defence, led by American lawyer Neil MacBride, set up a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the strategy of defence, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, named Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injury suffered by the staff in active service.
" The alleged ill is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are not always officially entitled to go to war, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, women's military teams play an increasingly important role, including in contact with local women.
As a result, during these two wars, 150 military women lost their lives - two thirds in a battle situation.
It's time for the army to modernise itself, Susan Burke.
She is not alone in fighting this battle: three other trials are ongoing in more than six years.
At Yale Law School, the Center for Legal Services of Veterans is preparing a case against the four main military committees to encourage a mystical environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the " personality difficulties" diagnostics attributed to the victims of violence in order to give them a leave - a relatively normal fact, according to the activists such as the Women's Action Network, Anu Bhagharu of the Service Women's Network, a group for human rights.
His group sought a trial in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way they dealt with requests for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent draft laws were presented to the Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered after the sexual assault centre (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Department of Defence.
However, it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. In fact, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The March report also examined the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases recorded in the army were conducted by a trial - half of the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
Susan Burke's complainants describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumatisms.
In Lyman's case, she informs the Military Police of violence less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to report 11 times in detail her violence to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She went up a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting in front of a judge, a trial during which she was asked about her sexual relationship with her little friend earlier on the day of her aggression.
Six persons testified as witnesses of the moral character of the author of the crime, who ended up being committed.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts, and I got to cry after the trial."
"I've been placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I'm out, I remember telling my commander "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosed with a personality disorder, making him inappropriate in the service.
In January 2010, it was sent under less honorable terms, preventing any benefit from being received.
Whether Lyman and other complainants will advance or not, it is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the University of Washington University of Law.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army has been in the past decades because it has not had the same advantages and means of dissuasiveness as the responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the trial doesn't turn into their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will collect hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, one or both of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who was a part of his online anti-immigrant opinion.
Lundi, Breivik, who admitted to being arrested in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent a lot of time fighting on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this state, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... connect to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so hard to find them," said Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report published by the DEMOS Group on digital population in Europe.
Facebook stores so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with a scientific accuracy - how marketing people have done it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members were members of extreme right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions were about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people with Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have been able to interview 10,000 participants from 14 extreme-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: the right-wing partners are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who engage in online and offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new uninterrupted tool among scientists.
Reflective groups, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study all health issues such as social trends, thanks to "J'amie", publications on walls and updated statutes.
With more than 800 million active users added to the average three content per day, the "surnova of data" generates a research explosion, increasing the number of research works that the site's name appears in almost 800 per cent over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you cannot approach in the street.
"First, when you tried to conduct investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," said Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a means of identifying and addressing health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin-Madison University, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their work as an embryonic had a lot more chance of being alcoholics than students who were discriminating on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as consultants, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't handle a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Children's Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also regularly accesss information from its users.
The website's data team studied statistics on the loving situation and the day of Saint Valentin, the participation rate for mid-term 2010 elections and a national welfare index (with only information available - digital freedom campaigns have long supported that the site could make its data channel available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not, instead of being able to play the Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined signs of how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a large number of users had already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, after a 2006 study he conducted observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As soon as they found out, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the true size of a profile or a user wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a block-note and style remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing will replace the real world and contact people," he said.
"Social studies are intended to address the social aspect - and social, it is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman": First Comparison of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that took 77 deaths in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter "resistance" during his first appearance in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Temples," he explained in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it because you have your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't apologize. "
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he didn't want to let him use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought him a speech on paper, to speak to the parents of victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in custody for a further twelve weeks, forbade him to speak to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Thirty parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in hopes of watching Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind the bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman" said a Utoya survivor at the Norwegian TV channel NRK.
"I wasn't on the show, but I personally made some progress after I saw and heard the suspect."
He looked at journalists and survivors in his eyes as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a broad movement of "resistance", the judge decided that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he was dealing with complications.
The expectations of 22 July therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may encourage some of them.
But this does not reduce the frustration or confusion felt by all the nations.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a parent of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' missing interview this week's film
After Steve Jobs died on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern information.
But what Apple's fans can find more obvious in Steve Jobs' entertainment recently found and will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit has included the processes and flow of work of products.
There was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He was identified by a hippie but also very mechanical and organized, as well as an organ improvementr - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from "a disease leaving them to think that a generous idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a generic idea of an exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series delays the computer's birth, and he spent more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At the time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, looking at a popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It is only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the realiser's garage.
This video, slightly remounted, is the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs film: The Lost Interview, which will be released to the movie Wednesday and the next Thursday.
For someone who knows how to hate deeply interested people, Steve Jobs here seems extremely enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and commercial strategies.
You're incredibly careful.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly expresses his thoughts, in order to provide a specific answer.
There are also times when Steve Jobs' perfectionism seems to be rising, where he seems eager to understand Cringely's questions, giving him cuts to make it faster and to deal with more important issues or issues.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is a strangely present aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he sees good or bad in other companies and shares his own view of the future of information.
It's a thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something gross and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dream of the big man.
It has a vision of how things can and must be.
He then explains the steps to be taken.
Here is a quick recapitalative of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
In the way he learned to run a business:
"For all these years, I have always asked, 'Why are you doing things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexe on how the costs were recorded - often started by a standard cost assessment, then adjusted with a "variation" - developed an automated tool that would guarantee the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs relates the anecdotes of the "Blue Box" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to pilate the telephone networks and call freely on long-distance.
The device has made many letters to the previous, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an instrument of approval is contaminated.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, by passing a call from an AT&T network to another by surrounding as many satellites as possible.
"We develop the noise of different things one half-to-one times and you want in the public telephone and that's a minute later on the public telephone next door," Jobs explains, laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of infrastructure worldwide."
We don't know much about both of them, but we have invented a small thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have existed a day without that.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have made: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the nice middle of the night by passing on to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two complexes begin to laugh just before the Pope himself was revealed.
On his love with technology (and the launch of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, at the age of 12, he searched for Bill Hewlett's number in the year and passed a haircut.
Not after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I've ever seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs became one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first-designed office computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode tube, and I fell in love.
The youth I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
On several occasions in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about inventing new products on a top of his head.
At the beginning of his career, while he was installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, the assembly and delivery of finished equipment must be covered.
Later, in Apple, there are difficulties encountered to develop a computer voice:
"I remember a big argument... I was raised above, claiming that I would need five years [to make a smile that would cost $300]. I had enough, I was out and I went to see a designer."
Twenty-ten days later, we had a smile that we could make for $15 and that would have been incredibly reliable.
On the big businesses that are in question:
Even before he relived Apple, Steve Jobs had predicted how many industrial leaders would suffer and lose control of their market share.
"Do you agree that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copyor or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the types of people] that end up leading companies and the specialized staff in production are set aside from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopole position is completely capable of people who cannot imagine to design a good product in relation to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to stop all the computer industry.
She could have done ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They brought the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn enormously about its subtleties.
There are commitments to do... Some things you can't do, the electrons can do it, the wind, the robots, the tools too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day that the good artists are busy and that the great artists want to.
We're always ashamed to want excellent ideas.
This is part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who were simply the best computer scientists in the world.
If this were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas are dealing with enemies of the right to health while the court meets
On the day on which the Supreme Court met closed to discuss the issue of political dispute, namely whether the opposition to President Obama's health law would be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner sponsored by the lawyer's office to defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss requests for consideration.
One of the cases involved a process aimed at 26 States in response to the reform of the Convention's ambitious health care reform last year, a law that was a binding point for national-level combatants.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument of 5 a.m. was expected in March, and the outcome will be likely to be of a nature to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential course, which will be very serious at the time the court's decision is taken.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the refusal of the law will certainly be Paul Clement, who served as the general applicant of the United States during George W. Bush's administration.
Clément's Legal Cabinet, PLLC Bancroft, has been part of two dozen cabinets that have helped celebrate the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a long-term group dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that participated in dinner, Jones Day, represented one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical genius Pfizer Inc, who presented a huge financial problem in the outcome of the battle.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court's conference on the case.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and an enemy declared by the Health Act.
You see the guests at dinner?
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing wrong with the rules of deontology.
In fact, judges are excluded from the code of conduct that governs the actions of the federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt argue with the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend meetings of funds of law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be an intervention, an invitation to honour, or a statement on the program of such an event."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the lawyers' cabins in the business, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, is sufficient to alert government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and extreme independence of the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were in and in a collection of Gala funds with lawyers who had cases before the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds for this event demonstrate any claim of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little concern for the criticisms that they claim to mix the court's affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas' wife, Gini, is a high-profile conservative warrior.
Also, the conservators claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general applicant for the administration of Obama when the first objections to the law were brought to the Court of First Instance.
His criticisms made pressure on Kagan to refuse to listen to the case, saying that she was too investment in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for line planes
The air carrier Emmirates controls 50 Boeing 777, bi-coluir line planes, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market worth more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving a order containing 50 of its products.
It is entirely a matter when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the sum of $18 billion.
It is also incredible who Boeing has received this command: the Middle East, a gold mine of future air orders.
In the forecast published Monday, Chicago company estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 aircraft of a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing reported the order of commercial aircraft the most expensive of its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-coluirs.
It is the air carrier Emmirates based in Dubai who passed this Pharaohic order.
Boeing announced to the Dubai Air Force 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that the Oman Air company ordered six Boeing 787-8, especially Dreamliners, a model that covers important fuel and comfort economies for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have an enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
Therefore, they have not only the means to pay these aircraft, but a amount of fuel price - a habit which is harmful to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them because the country would earn money with the oil price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than to cancel or disseminating their air orders when the oil price increases, Dihora reported.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The command of Emmirates strengthens Boeing's predominance on the market of large-port carriers and helps to counteract the attempt by the Airbus competitor with his A350.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Hall comes four months after Airbus' announcement to report the beginnings of the largest version of A350, which corresponds directly to Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus reopens its initiatives to increase the pressure following the request of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's actions increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The Mexican President's sister apparently beat up the election of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug dealers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the run-up to the Governor's position.
The sister of President Philip Calderon seems to have lost her attempt to access the government functions of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers had favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was head of the course at the position of the Governor of this Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is a alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon to the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they attacked the Urns, installed road barriers... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for sixty-ten years until the presidency was lost in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a few Calderon, who was leading polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a vainqueur.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-hand candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PPD, who is currently in charge of the government's functions, has arrived third, a criminal failure before the 2012 presidentials for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the State, broke down all ties with drug dealers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by specialized drug cartels in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
This is the original state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence continued.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections had the air, a winner will help the party in its struggle.
The man who was expected to represent the PRI in the course of the presidentials, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
The BASD strongly urges Asia to come to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would hinder the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the head of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest economic powers should "do everything they can" to speed up the recovery of the monetary area by means of the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "individual eye" and noted that Asian financial support from the leaders and resources of Europe would prevent a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore whoever can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected up to a certain point, but it is not open."
"So if China and India can help, nothing can prevent them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously affected by a crisis of sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian Empire is dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have released.
The flowering crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has raised the fear that the world economy will not be resuscitated, and has prompted the call for major emerging economies to meet together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag stressed that the IMF would provide all Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral assistance - such as purchasing the obligations of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would offer a greater power for negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
And Sharma, Minister for Trade and Industry of India, said that "India will do all it can" to help the euro area because its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a reduction in foreign capital revenues.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and busy," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to raise and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an imperial, because where are we going to find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich in Europe as they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, stated that it would be very politically difficult to accept European assistance to 1.2 billion Indians, of which at least 800 000 live with $2 a day, i.e. less.
"One day, they will find out that the Greeks take their 50-year retirement and that they go on vacation on the sun and they will have a bad summer," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poor management jobs, such as in the railway sector.
Mr. Nag said that the euro area crisis was likely to cause "significant impacts" through Asia.
The BASD estimates of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 are now facing "lost risks" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop "aid plans" in order to protect themselves from economic returns and significant wastes of capital.
Several warnings from the Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary to the Defence, Leon Panetta, raised the pressure on the Monday Congress, warning that the immediate automatic budget compressions would know national security, and launched a financial response to the Pennsylvania coalitions in Afghanistan's field of battle, through civil assembly.
The Pentagon has already amounted to $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more will be lost if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating to the Department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of the Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the call for segregation would result in 23 per cent reductions as well as the yellow of many new projects.
"A so important reduction, applied without discrimination, would make most of our ships and construction projects ineffective - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We will also be obliged to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would certainly have to send civilians away without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously undermine our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect the combatants, continues Panetta.
"While the financing of foreign contingent operations in wartime is not directly affected by segregation, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The contractual staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"The salary management staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a sequencing on the Department of Defence would have been a rapid decline in the United States as a world leader inconsistencies in military power."
"We are extremely opposed to this dramatic action," the senators said in a joint communiqué Monday after noon in the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"It is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not what we should impose."
"Secretion is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be produced."
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to avoid the Pentagon of Reduction, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vulnerable to possible compressions, even though it has reached the highest point in the Pentagon, which has accumulated years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence drew a summary of what might happen - a military soldier with a knife, but not a knife.
"It's a ship without marines."
"It's a brigade without balls."
"It's a cashier plane, not enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, a casserole army, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to deal with potential enemies."
"In fact, she invites the aggression."
In an addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically described how new reductions could " generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risks in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could be covered, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the ballistic submarine of a new generation, the new litral combat ship and the new land vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the sea.
Ending F35 development and testing could generate $80 billion of economies over 10 years, but its partners say it is an essential step in improving and responding to China's potential threats and other rivals.
How to Look at a False
A review of the recent shortcomings indicates what point the trompy and lies are all about in everyday life.
The Republican candidate to President Herman Cain is engaged in the exchange of sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administrators of Penn State were accused of fraud in order to have alleged coverage of reports by a football coach who was sexually assaulted by boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested by an open microphone claiming to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and confused countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has been led by an idiot by quickly issuing countermeasures against irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate to President John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-conjugal link.
And then, no one who has lived the story will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton started by lying at his second mandate on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Trichery records for tests at school and university are legitimate.
There were cases where teachers gave students test answers to their performance assessments.
False teachers who should teach the opposite send the message according to which lies and trichery are acceptable.
How many trophies do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are false lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, of the charades, where the goal is to write: "I've got you," the detection of trompery is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades in prestigious universities that have done a thorough research on such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest mythes on the lie have been proved.
The liers look at you in your eyes.
They're not happy, they're crying or they're not always worried.
Do not conclude that lies are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A qualified lies detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of reply.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from the knowledge of the trumpet, and it is clear that the detection of the trumpet is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include the packaging, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good liars are able to read well to others by putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitioning how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraversives lie more than the introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" than women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners than those who are not married (but the lies they tell have a tendency to be arrogant).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if you're thinking?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we're called "to establish the data we're looking at".
This helps provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch your subject, smile, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally removes his feet from standing so that you do not launch unjust charges when you see him remove his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these indicators as red tapes, not evidence of the trumpet.
Trompers can reallocate the body's height when they try to remember their history, they can push their feet to the door, think of a exit, change their position in a significant way, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exhilarating breath of relief, a change of position when all difficult questions are passed.
The questionnaires often indicate that the maintenance is done correctly to try to slow down the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject's vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson disappointed with the past by claiming that his murdered wife was alive, starting a national research to find her.
The trumpeters can also use a remote language: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or to repeat a completely difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to tell you the truth... if I remember my wealth... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptual answer rather than fact and is often a red suit.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize trompery is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by the shooters in their professional and personal life.
The contested oil plan will be removed after the United States' recent approval threat
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - raising the anger of the trade unions while welcoming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil said it was ready to redirect the project to put it on the rails.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the pipeline planned outside the ecologically sensitive zone of Nebraska's dunes, and it is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, says the company is confident that it will end up with the approval of an olive, but with a different route.
This led to the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it received new potential inland waterways studies to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and Ogallala aquifer from large underground water sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State would probably have rejected all decisions until 2013, following the elections of the next year, although officials do not have the involvement of policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km oil would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to pass through six States.
He is a host of ecologists, but he is loved by working groups, who have placed on the 20 000 jobs estimated in the oil industry.
However, the legislators of the Nebraska against this plan are forced by a law to strengthen the migration of the Sand Hills region and the Ogalla aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project would have only a limited negative environmental impact, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Director-General had ordered a separate investigation of the review process focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign consultant for Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice from its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continues for alleged cause of a young child of fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a violent detonation in their Manhattan furniture hall, terrorized their little daughter at the point where she was scared.
The drawing of the song "Lady Marmalade" inspired the 18-month-old young Geneviève Monk, to the point that she was subjected to "the personality changes, problems of the dream" and "the fear of strangers," said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was November 10th of the last year when scene technician Kevin Monk, his wife, a teacher of the garden of children, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to leave home.
While Kevin Monk was looking for the car, Roseanna Monk went down into their living room at Riverside Boulevard with their bags, carrying Geneva with his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped by the door and had put her daughter for a while.
"Someone came after me and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle acknowledged with anger the pregnant woman.
"She said to me of an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became pregnant and began to use jurons - the word """ and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water, and she started throwing me out of the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle got mad at her mother - who had always been Geneviève in her arms - and had to be kept by her surrounded by her driving to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she got drunk, she added.
Later, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's apology, but received no response.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complainant complained about the unexplained damage, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family intends to give all the money received from a charity work against cancer for children.
"The aim is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a teacher of mothers who carries a child of 18 months."
Climate aberration has enriched the economy
During the first year of the management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informatics in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy became engaged
2011 is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, the self-called change, which generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate aberration of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, apart from the loss of billions of agricultural sectors, limited the state's economy for growth, led to a contract of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, largely justified by the history down to 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report by the Mexican Council for Rural Development, there were 582 million farmed hectares, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops were the legums, mais and chichi fish.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three trimesters of the year has been observed accelerated, as during January 55,053 signatures, with a rate of 4,53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter, the rate of 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average increased to 6,19 per cent, a rate representing more than 74 thousand signages, an increase relative to the first half of 18 000,969 people.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the U.S. Department of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained directly according to public policy actions.
"What we observe is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because it is not easy for people who earn dollars in an illegal way to earn them, invest them and use them in something," he said.
_Other Organiser
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the State to work abroad has been limited to the United States, first because of the difficulties in entering and second because they have already had many difficulties in finding work, these people remain here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment grow," he said.
No serious errors
The analysis of the labour market in the signalled labour market is compounded by the high level of a serious lack of labour conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state of employment without being employed as a worker in any social insurance institution.
In addition to the unemployment and the lack of serious unemployment, another reason for the state's decline is the lower salary, the entity has the lowest wages of the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Prevention.
The average monthly income of signal workers was, by September, 5 000 352, very lower than the national average, which is 7 000 375.
IED Contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and unemployment, the most severe reduction in Foreign Direct Investment over the past 10 years was recorded in 2011 according to the Economic Secretariat of the State IED from January to June, which represents a decrease of $630,697,740 per cent compared to $5 million,143,312 registered in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Department of Economic Development of the Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion per year, primarily recorded by the companies of the tertiary sector.
Make this a recurring event
Given the economic contract scenario, the Government of the State requested in July to the public conference the approval of a 3 billion pesos credit for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of rehabilitating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pessimism and until November there was no benefit in any sector of the state economy.
Actions
For the representatives of the patrol sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrated a lack of capacity to manage the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wishes of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year was really very poor, and we need to work hard to recover the land that we lost this year, and in 2012 we must double our efforts, it has been necessary to align the efforts of all and especially the good brand of this new government team, hoping that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic Lent
Loredo López stated that events such as the ices of the beginning of the year held the state's economy and limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including ice, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we are very much closing below our expectations," he said.
Reset the vocabulary
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa stated that he wanted to channel the State into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have observed that it has been worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the state's vocation and economic direction, as it is important that the entire potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa is cut off," he said.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard and the Government is aware that there is still much more to do," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person living in Novoloto was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of amendment for eight kilograms of marijuana.
The General Park of the Republic reported that the convicted minor was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, guilty of a health offence, in his variant of marijuana possession intended for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by the Mexican Army during a surveillance operation in the Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the 80th in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small passenger was traveling in a pick-up truck type, white-coloured, in which he carried a black-colour bag in the vehicle's luggage and on the side of the trailer a small bag to two where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the District Judge Second and the convicted is still in the Crimes Legal Impact Implementation Centre.
These are contributions to the works
Social works in programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are not likely to be completed where to record serious delays from the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Mayor of Municipal Social Development indicated that even though construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a risk situation, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions of over 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that, in total, the investment of these three programmes was approximately 50 million, of which the State had to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the municipality had provided resources for the books, so there was a possibility of delay in their finalization.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have given us nothing, even though since July they have had to give us a part," he said, "and we, to record no delay, started the books and made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He noted that during the past year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the municipality had to request a loan to cover 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We have already done this in the previous sixtieth period because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to operate and this year, so that we can access these programmes, we had to get the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he explained.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages could be reached as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they have given us nothing."
The “analogic cut” Court in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) discussed the constitutional contradictions that the Senate and the Chamber of Members had formulated against the presidential order that went on to say "analogous cover" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes required for invalidity were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties when he issued the order detailing the steps to follow in order to establish the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been resolved not to reach the qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the order, and this continues to be in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a duty reserved by law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Coffetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Members have proposed two constitutional contradictions to oppose the order and by adopting complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the order and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also decided to draw up the complaint made by the Chamber of Members, without discussing the draft which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his statement, the Prime Minister said that he was not in agreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for public administration to prepare for.
"I no longer consider it to be a matter of the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has for constitutional mandate the direction of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years, and this is a better operation of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
To update the change, he supported, would be to update the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest which has not only a technical dimension, "including economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he pointed out, "requires the operation of any established system, in accordance with the principle of state economic direction, to include a group of attributes that the Constitution grants to the State Executive. "
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested order, had in a manner in place the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere respect for the laws issued by the Act.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote vote" in Michoacán
According to the data shown by the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the total votes of 879 out of 6 000 74.
The possibility of the "vote vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting for the total votes of 879 out of 6 000 74.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Ministry of Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, while the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline expires so that this electoral process could enter into force and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel has issued his publication within the time-limits provided for by the State Journal Act, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9th, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative power and appointed the vote of the mandater of the state for constitutional reform, since he did not have the right to "sanctify or answer".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Angeles London said that through the approval of the guidelines corresponding to the IEM General Council, it would be possible to make partial and full voting statements by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial polling of votes, one or more electoral packages can be said to be: the results of the oral proceedings do not match; there is no trial trial trial and is not found in the Urn file in the President of the House; or there are evident errors or alterations in the oral proceedings.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all election sessions can be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate claimed benefiting from the election and the candidate who received the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is a petition expressed by the representative of the party and/or coalition who submitted the second of the candidates notified.
The total outcome of the survey can also be achieved if at the end of the joint survey it results that the difference between the alleged candidate and the second candidate is equal to or less than a percentage, provided that there is a request made by the representative of the political party whose candidate is a second party, where the electoral packages that have been issued are excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PRP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the total votes of 129 of 923.
Its last will
His bones will be placed in the Sera of Zapalinamé, confirm the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday to the night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a demand.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant Colonel was that his ashes should be placed in Zapalinamé's grave.
After receiving the damages on the side of the other people to be killed in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on a plane from the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant-colonial seats arrived at the bulvard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends returned.
At 17:30 a.m., he was presented with tribute to the Saltillo Technology Institute organized by his former colleagues of the technological battalion and the American football team, which was part of Felipe Bacio when he was preparing for the Baccalaureate.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and his ashes were thrown into Zapalinamé's serra, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's brother.
For her, the colonel had performed all her dreams, she thought that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a caring brother and a great care of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they said he had even a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahaccoon to Saltillo."
The young man remembers the fact that when he was seven years old, he traveled to Zapopán for his parents' graduation, so he knew that his uncle was dead doing what he loved most in life: piloting an airplane.
Last Played
It was said with respect to the visit to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who, at the head of Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, the directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished both in studies and in sports.

Three left bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had presented to the media 11 persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for organized crime crimes.
Three men were found killed by shots of fire in different parts of the body and with the cut of grace, in a abandoned property of the municipality of Cadreyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place about 1.5 km from Cadereyta road in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have gone through this area have observed that in the property, with the closure of the beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
With regard to the inside, approximately three metres, they located the bodies of three persons, which they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with bent jeans, without shoes; on the other hand there was another with a white T-shirt, with glasses.
At a distance there was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue-coloured jeans.
The three were extended on the roof.
According to the data obtained on the site, three persons had been murdered elsewhere, because there were no cases in place.
In the closing of the property there were legends addressed by a criminal group organized to each other, apart from a few whales in it and in the portal.
11 captures in Cadereyta
The Secretary of the National Defence made the presentation of 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that served mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta, who were considered to have relations with sequures, Homicides, Halconeo (supervising) and clandestine infections.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested on 11 November in the Colony of Los Alveros and managed to rescue one who had been deprived of liberty.

By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the soldiers found a long sword, a cargo and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 a.m., one of his complexes was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the soldiers.
They are attributed to clandestine inhumation in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The first Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed this country on the side of the economic disaster.
The first Minister appointed, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has left Italy on the side of the economic disaster and has put an end to all the Eurozone.
A communiqué of the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that a cabinet composed of most of its technocrats will be presented, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume its position.
Monti said he would present the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn," he adds.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, at a time less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has caused the cost of its debt to levels that cannot be sustained.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a strong asylum package required by the European leaders to recover confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to settle, the instability of the markets in place of the performance of the Italian BTP obligations of more than 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcagagglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria patronage, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The chances of Monti's success were greatly encouraged by the support of the PDL Party of Silvio Berlusconi, whose crisis required release last Saturday.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts will be a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right-wing party.
PDL support, the largest part of Italy, is significant because so far many of its members have been opposed to the Government of the technological majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be imputable austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks was added to the pressure by observing that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and sponsors and youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his round of meetings tomorrow night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, which enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief review at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was about to be released, the costs of Italian debt are now at critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue to pursue future elections, planned for 2013, despite generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to apply reforms before the elections begin.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insist that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources have noted that mutual misunderstandings and disputes between parties are complex in their attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 football players called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 guests attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica's, if compared to the 22 calls by the two countries for friendship today, at 15:05 a.m. at San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, the number one of the FIFA's monthly classifications, account for a wide range of class A inter-election games, the Tricolor has only the Michael Umana champion as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was achieved on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish football players who play in the League of Stars and powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain an intensive activity in national leagues and cuts and disputes in European teams such as the League Championships.
In addition, the experience with Furia Española needs to be added during the complex eliminations of the European Cup and the World Football.
The Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to a zone, such as the Concaf, which is considered to be a lower level in the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the Íker Casillas goal guard, which the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) added to the record of the former goal guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casallas will play against the Tricolore today and will create a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, flying the Barcelona brain in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA alongside the other hundreds of Iberian teams, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's leading centre, Raúl González, with 102.
The top of the century's figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Ineista, with 62; Casse Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the coastal side, and near Michael Umana is the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz Butter, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
The historical butter of Spain is David Villa, with 50 mice, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers it the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality."
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also be a dream that has become a reality in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament made sure, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American island of its two working days celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
This day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 19:30 a.m. on behalf of the Los Angeles Group The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract from the conversation, where complete transcription is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican adaptations, the fact that Pearl Jam will occur in Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality. Are you aware of what your fans are living in?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I spent only once in Costa Rica's holiday; it's such a beautiful country, and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it makes us feel to bring our music down there.
I'm asking you, because there's a kind of devotion to the group, the boys live with the intensity of the previous days.
What is your message for your most comfortable adaptive?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we are disappointed that so much time had to pass to this concert.
Some people already say their concert is the biggest show of the year.
This adds a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we've offered in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We have offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very impatient to produce it.
We love this country, we love to make the surf and the jungle; for both things Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its cows to make the surf?
We have many superior friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and vagues are incredible there.
My friends were always going to do surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along the coast of Mexico, and that is what we learned through people who love surfing.
When you saw the tournament, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we are never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and different record.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that got to do with it?
I think this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each love of different songs, which is why it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the library that we haven't interpreted for so long, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons we love these songs and that we can have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and as a result, I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined we were going to form a big rock group, and the fact that we've done it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love and worship to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we always want to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunt?
This has always been a honour for us to be part of this large group.
We're very close to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chain.
It's amazing when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is not common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is a honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with them all and it's a honor to be part of this Seattle sound that arose.
It is also very strange that a group like yours maintains unity and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and that's just a lot longer than many groups usually endure.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be alive and secondly, we're all worried about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical bulevards that give freedom to each experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you can do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We will make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of the great crowd and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are here for music, this helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what it has brought, without focusing on the fact that we're famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a group for almost three years and did not publish a disc before Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There have been many frustrations about the fact that she has endured so little and most importantly is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he laughed, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a wonderful human being, and he lacked us.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose to open it?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved most, so we are excited to see what Las Robertas can offer directly and that must be very interesting.
Why are you always changing Yello Ledbetter's words?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
It's him who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so much...
Among the first I remember was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunt relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the Georgian word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have come up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's great, because it's a music that's worth listening and groups like Mudhoney are doing the best music they've ever done.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem smaller, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I wept when I heard them, and these are deeply confused songs.
I think if you're big and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things begin to influence your art and music and these songs, of course, represent it for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even as we can do this with the hidden music.
Peru:
Sujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength that he has in his feet, he informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who serves as a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various infections, including language cancer for which he was four times under control.
Congressman Alejandro Agunga, his personal doctor, said for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower members.
Agunga commented that in her opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to benefit from the release of the penalty for humanitarian reasons, he said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
Four times the language cancer has been performed, it has lost weight of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe gastrointestinal fever, pancreas, renal calculations, arterial hypertension and foot circulation problems, have listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in the National Police Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people due to a military ignition squadron that had been in prison for the first years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to consolidate political links
An official corrigendum, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and employers, will launch a visit to Mexico this morning to expand trade between the two nations and address the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long-term agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Georgian community living in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France when French mandater Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of fiscal paradises at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's refusal and its appeal to the Ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been taking the lead since November in the G20, a group of emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been with South American countries since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to secure the establishment of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
From 2004 onwards, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu flower passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the Griffles of poor Bowser, but he has never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of youngster in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month at the world stores, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which enables you to play three dimensions without using moons.
"Mario is the person who has to say how to operate the free-screen stereoscopy," said Nintendo specialized press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because until now success such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's speech supports that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and liquid part.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simply" to increase the less-skilled users.
Once mounted, the most experts will be able to make a "second tour" at game levels, which are more difficult this time.
In addition, users will be able to choose real time between a "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but this would require three-dimensional play in order to overcome the different challenges and "not to fall into optical illusions".
This super Mario intrusion in the three dimensions also assumes the return of personnel to a mobile console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eyeline for the saga adapters and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustach flower has to walk through mini-pill platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I am a player, I find news in movements, environments, customs and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "joyable".
Colom gives his avalanche to the release of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy of $70 million.
This will end the trial so that Guatemala will respond to the request from the northern country who claimed Portillo for the trial.
At a press conference, Columbus stated that his decision was subject to the independence of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his mandate "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given course to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be betrayed for serious murder and injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be betrayed for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done suggests an executive approach after issuing all judicial and constitutional authorities to judge the former mandate of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolutely responsible for the disbursement of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs called and re-affiliated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity is born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove Social Support Institute is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
This adds to the hundreds of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to balance in a celebrated act in an old industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the village of Trinitat Vela in 1986 with the aim of helping people with little training, without work, with problems of toxicity or marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in San Andreu has concentrated on a large number of responsible bodies and institutions that have collaborated with the association for the past 25 years.
The variety of political representations, in full electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Catalan Regional Government (General), Artur Mas and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, attended the event with the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Margall and former mayor of the mayor and current city councillor Richard Goma.
We also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats the current Minister of Social and Family Welfare, Joseph Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that it is now also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to fight bad circumstances and to give people hope in difficulty.
"The crisis is nothing new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property enquired by squatters for micro-feet, evacuated
Invasives were suitable for 11 of the 13 buildings of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 employees left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
It seems to indicate that the closing of the inhabitants of Rue Balmes ' 51 had ended.
Twelve people left at noon yesterday voluntarily the property they were dealing with illegally and where they organized micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the doors were changed to avoid the situation being repeated.
"From this day there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, which had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were used - brought the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving wastes of any kind, especially of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the stage of mass festivals, which would last for up to two days and expect the tenants.
On the side of the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the construction of the building her business has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque announced that the owners of the property would make it of remote jurisdiction, because they sold the wines to three euros, while the discotheque was worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the loisers had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to this, the noise was not caused by the customer of the discotheque, but by the house owner, especially the participants at the festivals organized there, which were more frequent and intentional in the last few weeks, according to the area's neighborhoods.
The discotheque officer explained that the monks were so big that they even had an agreement with the owner of the furniture and that it took nine months before he "forgives him" to hire him.
Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks for this situation.
The president of the PP group of the mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week "the immediate eviction of the building to end with the problems of common and civil life which it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "it must end with impunity and be in place against the anti-social behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday, Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's 35th place, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed four people arriving at the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of summoning beyond the polymers on honor
The municipal competition on the 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, in full support of the Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration has printed copies of Collserola's promotion.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not go to the north-south axis, but rather high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with bleedings in the role of Yogi.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor called for a competition of 16 competitions for all access doors in Collserola.
A door returns to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared only: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to the reflection on the city, is a subject of discussion of all the architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme whose two members of this former elite castle speak when they recognize themselves in a elevator.
And this is just one of the rare views on which three architects in Barcelona, university professors, who have been present.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Roland, after addressing the literary front "it's necessary" to discuss "the mountain front" because the talk of Ildefons Cerda, that of green houses, was not finished.
"It must come from the base that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," he gave the award to the architect for which the title "ports of Collserola" affirms a "local wall": it is not necessary to think of those "how access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it has to act".
Modol, like Rollan and Bayona with experience in the urban world, defines the proposal as "intellectual challenges" with "a few losses".
The "insecure of the projection of public space" after the experience took place in the 1980s, which was in the Forum's "song song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which we can build.
"Limiting something means setting up the next step," that is, over.
"It is necessary to consider new urban and planning instruments, because current [in reference to the General Métropolitan Plan (PGM)] may cause real disasters."
In keeping with the question further, Modol believes that, by simplifying the reader of the region El Valleys de Collserola "may be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not be lost", thanks to the opportunity the bride offers to her corporation to participate in this project "from the first time".
Furthermore, he believes that the approach of the mountain with the city is the safe-guidance that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that it must be created: "We, architects, should be just one instrument".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that gives the title of this room is complex, because the basis of the competition lacks a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-border competitions - say it - in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no long-term reading that sees and understands the area as a whole."
This is, at least in this case, what he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to jump into the program and definition with the architect of the nearby door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that takes a mild transition between the city and the green.
Casino apologizes to Jonas Larrazabal and he will be released free
After 72 days of temporary arrest, the legal authority fund of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged songs
After 72 years of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released free after the legal power of Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for singing against the brother of the Mayor of Monterey.
After the attention of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas claimed to require him to pay for an economic quota so that Monterey's mother can enable the clandestine functioning of the game house.
After the public announcement, the Park opened a criminal trial against the brother of the PANist mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in temporary detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Department Officer 3 of Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the Centre of Detention 1, located in the former Quarter of State Capital.
It remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had removed the offence of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal centre assumed to sing with a million and half the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the process established in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, a arrest order was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as that of the loss of 1.5 million weights of representatives of the game house in exchange for his function.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal authority of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented before Judge José Luis Pesina to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Ministry of Public Affairs arrested at the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and which of the members of the game house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
According to document 197/2011, a legal apology was granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no claim for an attempt against him will be made; no damage will be required and no punishment will be imposed.
After the hearing of the legal authority of the game house, at 15:50 a.m. the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome shared the details of the air accident in which he lost his life by the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others
The Department of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the incident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others had lost their lives, indicating that the helicopter was directly shocked at the soil in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft deceleration, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the soil, the poles had been contacted with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuse."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
Furthermore, he said that the investigations carried out in the affected area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In one study it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The floor had a floor of seven to 30 degrees inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary has made sure that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may take a few months, it may even last a year.
On his tour, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Assistive Services, made sure that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential State was operating rapidly and that was on a rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal functioning to cross at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Full View:
According to the Aeronautics regulations, the flight has been carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The reports in the ICM indicated appropriate conditions for decaling, and in the morning and measured that the aircraft was moving towards the border area between DF and the state of Mexico had low-level nebulism rates.
Selected paths:
It is likely that because of the weather conditions, the crew had searched for a lower altitude area and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the latest recording of the aircraft on the current radar, probably before the impact, have not been lost or controlled or increased by the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of the remaining aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact has been placed on a right and lateral trajectory.
The model for the dispersion of the remaining aircraft allows us to assume that the helicopter has landed against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No fire or explosion traces have been detected:
There is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, it was found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9 000,200 feet above the average sea level, and the soil had a pen that went from seven degrees to 30 degrees inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have been disarmed along his trail.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that helicopters may have multiple effects on the soil.
After a minute of research in a wider area than the site, around the accident, there were no different parts of the aircraft, which led to the assumption that the impact was carried out under structural integrity conditions.
MSS protocol announcement to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts research to discover the gender of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a research to discover the gender of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will allow for post-optimal markers.
In a communication, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by experts and students from the third cycle of the National Institute for Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestät) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the legal or non-legal population, to present to the IMSS participating sports units in Valle de Mexico, where evidence is made to minors from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the Protocol had begun in the Sports Unit Cuahtémoc (México Ponente State) and that since 8 October, the activity took place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (México East State).
After reaching the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Independent Unit (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Sporty Morelos Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this research and that of identifying the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identifying risk factors among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on the World Day of the Diabetes, he mentioned that the goal was to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with their parents' consent and under the supervision of them, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family legacy of their disease, to avoid risk factors that trigger infections such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that the Samedis will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weights, size, size conference), arterial pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (to be found to identify people associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarm alarming in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there had been an increase of 77 per cent in obsessive and 47 per cent in girls, and with regard to survival, there was also a dramatic increase in IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers was based on the fact that the country's population was different from the others by its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of indo-American heritage, 30 per cent of Europeans and 5 per cent of Africans, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are inconsistency to burn the excess energy consumed (calorie), which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to detect a degree of obesity or obesity.
She even said that the presence of more black (acanthosis) on the neck and front arm indicates the probability of suffering from metabolic and even prediabetes disorders.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors return it in writing to the parents, to whom every measure and changes in the lifestyle that they must make in order to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause superpowers, obesity and other chronic infections: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the television and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another reason is the high caloric ratio, i.e. the largest consumption of sugard beverages, carbon hydrates (tamas - meat pasta of corn in corn flour developed in maize leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fat and protein and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the University of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cases each rain season in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, warns Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the University of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the construction and maintenance of the bitumen floor is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even removed completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cases, organized in the International Year of the Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture of similar characteristics to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in areas where the climate is extremely hot, like some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and consequently, the formation of cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the most heavy part of the oil, is a mixture of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight called Maltese, which together give the powder its viscosity.
The viscosity of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, at about 180 degrees, behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C presents a relatively strong state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes falling, adding it.
This means that the resistance of the asphalt in the streets is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in most of them were covered by a flexible wall, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three involving the asphalt.
Among the most surface layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stone cut into asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the hole, signaling it, is washed or asphalted.
When vehicles make efforts there, it allows the forces to thrive very well in the mud.
If we had the modified asphalt, they would have spread better, according to the chemical engineer.
On the shoulder of the asphalt, he said, it was put on a last layer called the roll of the stone, made into final stone, that is, of the sand which is also washed into the asphalt.
As this is the bridge in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
As part of the pave that receives and distributes the effort, the wheelchair also requires that it has an adequate space and the material it is made must be cared for.
The climate, particularly humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as these have a significant impact on the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil melts, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult to produce, which brings back all the layers of the powder and consequently causes cassies.
In the process of formation of a case, he said, the first one that falls is the rolling film and only later is affected by the asphalt layer, but the damage has not immediately taken place, but it is a process that must be cared for by the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System ofchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassies and therefore the length of each deck must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent training of cassies.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the bitumen emulsions that exist in other countries already on the market and allow for easy repair of cases and without having to use high temperatures.
What happened to Valle's candidate for the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led Melina Ramírez Serna to fail to obtain Ms. Colombia's crown.
Valle received his title number 14 from the princess.
Once again, Valle del Cauca remains with the desire to win Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she was on the winner podium, bringing the gold crown and the band that trusted her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already has 14 titled Princesses and Melina joined a bill of women from Valle del Cauca who have been found near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1989), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Rome (1993), Giselle Garcées Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007) (Garées).
Today the big question that many people around the world ask is:
What did he miss? Because the result is the failure of a great favour that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected Queen of the Police and Best Visit Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalie Navarro who had brought Miss Colombia's crown.
The first factor considered in the decision taken by the jury of the First Princess is that she did not agree with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you, and why? by Martin Murillo Gómez, of the Carta Literaria Leamos.
Here's the answer to Valle's application to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, and I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is "the little prince", it's a very deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Châtiment", it's a universal literature book that we all should read; and now I read the book of Irene Niirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Blood Loss".
This answer was not first asked because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each book mentioned it.
But at the end of Melina's ceremony, she said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wisdom, it happens what has to happen.
And for the whole world, please read, "The little prince" is a big book.
Among the hypotheses launched there is the one that Valle was destroyed by the favorism.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that being the preferred, ovarian and candidate who received all the preliminary prices (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artistic custom, and Queen Mother), "this revealed the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and was why she did not shine on the scene."
And this was noted in his first presentation in a bathroom in Hilton Beach and his two defies from the Coronation Guard.
Even though it seemed safe for the two refugees, it was noted that it did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osario, a journalist of the program "How to go home" (As at home), of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was designated princess "confirms that the candidate who receives most of the prices during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the pressure to the end, and this was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Ms. Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, but before starting the Competition, it is already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also said that Valle sinned by his faults behind him and the fibrosis that was observed in his mind, but this is contradictory, because the jury specifically chose him as the "natural beauty" candidate with the most healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen's cook Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina had no better body, but he had better "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdominal, which in fact was not too noteful for me, he left the point of the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos magazine, believes that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgical interventions she had taken.
"The surgeons are good, but Valle has no power to do them.
His body was never his body and it was lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Beauty Competition was awarded for the first time, after the Bain Mail stand came up with a terrible prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo did in Melina so as not to give him the taste of the crown.
In reality or not, the truth is that Melina is starting today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia in an international competition with the designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her revealing passage through Cartagena, did not receive the crown.
So it was the work of Cali's person who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
Cali's dactyloscopist has gone through history as the man who confirmed the death of 'Alphonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4th, a dactyloscopist of Cali's CTI passed into history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farcs: "Alphonso Cano", in comparison with his digital impressions.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the ITC's local offices, this week was the "accessibility" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the judicial investigation area.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Chocó, where he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after having followed appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the hair of the frying, i.e. the feet and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, it was announced to Eliazar that he would take at least three days' customs with him.
Something really big was waiting for her.
Friday night he's part of Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that he was suspected that one of them was the man who was leading the world's oldest guard, so he was asked to carry the card with the ten digital printers of Guillermo León Sáenz (not his real name).
But when he arrived with the research team at the place of the body, he did not recognize him physically because he was very different from what he saw in the media.
He had no barbes, he was dressed like a landscape in the area, without moons and much more maggots.
But the press don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian loupe, the encre, a receiver and a Lantern, Eliazar compared the digital prints of the body with those of the card.
His eye didn't miss him: it was about "Alphonso Cano."
That same night, Puerto Tejada's original man was the one who confirmed to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the Supreme Chief of the Farcs.
In search of the printer
For a dactyloscopist in Sijén de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos at Eliazar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people didn't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations for crimes such as flight and homicide and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their digital prints and search in the database.
The researcher found that in a flight case he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand in making a full-time gift of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to draw a digital impression, but in this case we have been able to obtain the impression of all hands and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
Printers may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man with bottles of wine around him.
During the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and that an impression on the bottle was consistent.
Even if this doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it's the place on the crime scene.
One CTI databaselogist explained that it was extracted "the digital inputs of objects with chemical or physical reactions".
When they appear, they use a receiver or a flag to take them.
Subsequently, the printers are sent to Asif, the database of offenders, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of unpaper Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything we touch doesn't become a force.
However, it may be used if the necessary comparison is made.
"Indignants" defend the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators raced to Zuccotti's place to camp there.
A large part of the people arrived at the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Integraters of the occupation Wall Street movement challenged New York's authorities this morning by attempting to enter again, through a judicial order, in Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the outback and when they tried to hire another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of demonstrators raced to Zuccotti's place, where they wanted to have access through a judicial order that allowed 'indignants' to camp again in this place, while the rest of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will install ourselves elsewhere and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sites and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the portals of the "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the 'indigenous' response to the evacuation of their camp personally ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived at the courts where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignants' occupied a new park located at the Confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which is connected to New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they succeeded in occupying the place, but after the police moved and stopped some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the actual number, ensuring the effect of seeing some journalists who had also been there for minutes.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of persons who have been installed in this area, where a delegation of religious leaders has been moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place - which is a private property agent - remains closed waiting for the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, while we must analyse the legality of the eviction this morning.
Several delegates moved up there and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time and even delivered it to the agents who were monitoring the scene, which caused 'some small confrontations', reported Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had beaten the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evaluating the members of Occupe Wall Street or applying laws published after the commencement of the occupation or prohibiting the exhibitors from re-entering the park with attempts or other properties they used earlier.
Major Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the opening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, who had warned them that local laws would not allow them to install themselves with tentacles and sleeping bags.
The municipal council personally defended the eviction carried out on the site of Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 persons were arrested and who was decided on the fact that the demonstrators 'were in violation of the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the place to be evacuated because it was "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others," because "some stores had received threats" and the residents were afraid of "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning at the Aube has been rebuttal and shows that the Bloomberg Foundation is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," adds the spokesman for the movement, who accuses the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
"Occupe Wall Street" officials also indicated that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which started on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Noel television program
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will come out in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a nurse in "Baywatch", a lapin in "Playboy", married to rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Christmas in Canadian television.
The private CTV TV channel announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will come out in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st to interpret a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has today distributed images of the TV program in which Anderson, also known for the wide dissemination on the Internet of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the batter of "Mötley Crée", Tommy Lee, appeared as the Virgin Mary, supporting in a cross a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently introduced a part of Charlie’s "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared as Joseph.
On the side of Anderson and Peters, the special program of Noel de CTV also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not even far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan got back after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ended the drop-down spiral from March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, even though after the terrible earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II has taken place.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses of $300,000 million, a time that, despite the difficult global context, seems to be expected.
After three consecutive trimesters of losses, the data of the Gross Internal Product between July and September were used to finalize the page: the GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent at an annual rate.
He registered the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also supposes to be the largest growth rate since the January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore areas destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami.
In fact, businesses increased their investment by 1.1 per cent, with a reduction of 0.9 per cent of the capital expenditure observed in January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real incentive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse that invites the crisis to consolidate or rebuild infrastructures, to use the gaps for zero growth.
Japan was especially exposed through the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The y-axis
Tokyo was transferred to the internal market when the yen - the Nippon coin - became one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors who were the debt crisis in the euro area and the U.S. forecasted hardship, a privilege that was lost as a contribution to the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic fluctuation is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor results between July and September.
While the markets continue to sit in the periphery countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not hold back.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not of any encouragement.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that most Member States had presented in September clear signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the global economy's inflation points has released that the main powers are frozen.
Because that one dropped four decimal points to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, reducing eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Get food again from doubt
We said that the settings will be approved, but the conservators will not sign a written commitment.
With reduced peripheral risk premiums and the uncertainty installed in the parks, Greece continues to settle in the labyrinth leading to the outbreak of the great crisis of European debt.
The sense that the "consensual" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels, which, by a genuine conviction of political forces, begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos pointed out yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period set out in its designation could be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement of new elections for the scheduled date on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that would end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of staff and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader went a step further in his lungs than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that have to unlock the 8,000 million Athens needs urgently, and said clearly that he would not approve any letter of commitment to the adjustments.
However, the European Commission, still angry by the impact of the pope's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not block the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very fast" to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth fine" of 8,000 million, even if there is no more final date.
The Greeks still have much to do.
The Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Kingdom underlines Spain's "presiding" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a world-wide premier position in the role of Microfinances".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the second provider of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation, which is "existence" in the fact that it is a " instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in human beings".
The Queen opened the World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015 and, "very specially, in the one that aims to reduce the volume of people living with incomes under a dollar per day, which is the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continued to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all parts of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which would extend until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and best opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a debate forum but also as the platform from which it has to push "two basic goals".
His Majesty thus explained that by the end of 2015, there were 175 million poor families who had access to these financial services and that hundreds of millions of these families are from the poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the concept of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the beginning of it a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Queen Sofia as a "justice act and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "adorable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "on each meeting I have been able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project had brought him the "family head" qualification at Valladolid, in the part of "the Bank of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia has completed its intervention by encouraging the people present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity is "a ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic prosperity times, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit was "a serious and rigorous policy devoted to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries should work under the criteria of solidarity and not leave it to be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, called for "the success" to give "of confidence" to the people "excluding those who are close to the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, wished to welcome the people present in a city that "opens its gates contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to lift the European President to the universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU) held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, the Chancellor, but also the President of the Christian-Democrat Party.
Europe's future was not initially planned for the programme but was imposed on itself, in particular to satisfy the combatants who judge the government's policy too low to see the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion for the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovulation of several minutes that were entitled to, following their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave any doubt.
The idea-mastership of the Chancellor - and of the Movement - holds in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "Time has come from a perpetuation in Europe".
This could be translated by amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also be based on the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffering "in order to face Europe".
In any case, this is one of the motion proposals adopted by the convention, which clearly inspired Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Vingt-Septs will soon agree on this revolution: Great Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also the same.
But the jalon's set.
In the same way, the delegation rejected the proposal to impose the weight of each country on the Director of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which, of course, meant strengthening Germany's weight.
The chancellor has expanded its references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has no longer sought to win its conference on the two "small" countries of Europe or countries with immediate difficulty to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the movement on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not appeal to France.
Except in crescendo.
Recalling that it was two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is the fraud of the sick arrests?
After admissions, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on the disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family rent box, and to give a talk on the theme - which has been in the course of 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a willingness to make economies in a rigid context, but is no less advert of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority want to focus on disease arrests.
Firstly in a budget economy goal: the government intends to impose a fourth day of unemployment on the employees of the private sector before taking over a job.
Obviously, without a specific undertaking agreement, a payer who falls sick would lose four days of pay, thus at least 15 per cent of his monthly income.
A measure that could lead to anger, but which would make it possible to report €280 million, according to Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by a different, more symbolic measure: to impose on staff a day of non-reimbursable unemployment in the event of termination of work (they have not so far a period of unemployment, against three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relax the subject of fraud, focusing this time on the abuses associated with the labour market.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you're taken, you'll be reimbursed," Xavier Bertrand warned at RTL micro, on Monday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at the workplace.
This has been the subject of constant political and offensive follow-up since 2002, which has most often brought its fruit.
The French are no more ill than in Europe.
Let's start with national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million of daily payments were delivered in 2006.
According to the Health Research and Documentation Institute, the daily benefits represented 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion.
On this basis, 46% were affected by maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% were affected by health arrests, which were EUR 6.2 billion.
So 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French knew on average 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting group.
One average hiding some discrepancy: another survey published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site showed that 75% of the 40 000 interviewed French employees said they had not taken a day to stop the disease.
Another study, this time of disease insurance, indicated that 37 per cent of the disease arrests were under 8 days, 22 per cent of 8 to 14 days, 15 per cent of 15 days per month, 15 per cent of one to three months, and 11 per cent of them.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French employees are no longer in a position to stop work.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health reasons or not) was oscillating between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared to 20% and 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The fraud at the end of the disease is very little at work in the dark.
As far as fraud is concerned, it reaches only a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls on disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of more than 45-day arrests, systematically controlled, 11 per cent of "inadapted or unjustifiable" cases were estimated at 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 "unjusted" cases, on several million employees who had a disease arrest.
A figure that represents very little faces, for example, to one who works in the dark.
According to UMP Dominique Tian, author of a June report on the issue, this would represent EUR 9-15 billion in the absence of tax per year, more than the total cost of daily payments, and therefore more than the fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said in front of Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his Government of the Union would not be enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue economic recovery efforts, we need support from our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of the government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote on trust in the Mercred Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is in play", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced to "9 per cent" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right to refuse new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right file, gave Monday his support to the already approved measures to try to get out of the debt crisis but prevented his party from getting involved in an extra austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt, and of combating guises but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who predicted that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of EUR 8 billion required without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
A committee of experts has to legalize euthanasia and suicide.
Canadians live in the death penalty, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In relation to palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the throes of death.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions for this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, which has participated in six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow suicide to be assisted and euthanasia, when this option is imposed, with a patient competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning of the game, experts refer to a recent survey of the United World Intelligence Economist, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada was classified as 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And although most Canadians wanted to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them ended up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that the federal government has already said that it would not want to change anything to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or discriminated against, there is no evidence that this discrimination leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide involving non-compliant or unconstitutional persons.
On the contrary, it stated yesterday at the conference of Jocelyn Downie, rapporteur of the report, that there would be more cases of such deliberations specifically in countries where euthanasia and AIDS are not legalized.
"Euthanasie is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians in favor of euthanasia
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already declared themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people to end their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message unless the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
In the case of people who have been involved in suicide, it is estimated that 41 per cent should not be continued.
In the case of maintenance or discontinuation of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggested that it should be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not a criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained to comply with a life-threatening refusal without fear of criminal prosecution.
In relation to palliative care, the Committee claims that governments, health care institutions, and doctors work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not intended to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Me Pierre Deschamps, a health-right specialist, has "extreme" the position of the report's signatory experts, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminal diseases.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who would have been more than 18 years old could ask for help to kill himself," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
My Dischamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all the other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
Or, "in society, he says, there are balances and constraints."
Health Law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifeste".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly in line with the data of the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw his power
Ladies pronounce a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachar al-Assad's supporters appeared yesterday at the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures have been intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, which, with Russia's support, resists them and declares a "complete" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, close to Syria, took a position in favour of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "resurrection" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar was interested in his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new stage of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, lamented that Turkey's media efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have been overcome by a lack.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and are not able to satisfy them," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey adopts a stronger line.
The United States is in favour of a "enforcement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey adopt a stronger tone" facing the repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman from the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime died in the region of Dera, south of Syria, announced the Syrian human rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians lost "the exchanges of arrows and pilnage to the heavy metallic loads in Jobar" in the town of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem, however, felt that the country would "go to the end of the crisis".
He also has a strong response to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damas from his work, which is, according to him, "a dangerous step".
Syria "does not laugh," he added, ensuring that "the plot against Syria will fail".
Following her decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "Citizen Protection Mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also said in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he claims to be sick in "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to focus on the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities in the process of protesting and liberation of arrested protesters.
Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, condemned the Arab League's decision "inaccurate" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while maintaining its support for any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Mounting demand for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, called for some time on the markets to form his team and implement a programme, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with the unionists and the patronage.
It should set up a relatively limited cabinet composed of external technologies in Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews after meeting the President of the appointed Council.
The President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt a dozen ministers, to the head of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of business and mandatory markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are specific times" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying "sure that markets will be patient and understand".
Its appointment by the President had been initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was echoed, in particular, after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The first appointed minister should be a team, especially of technocrats, even if he stressed that he would like to include "politics" there.
The new government has to endure until 2013, the date of the next legislation, it has estimated.
According to the President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti once engaged, once in office, to work in the emergency and with the aim that Italy "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A speech by European Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance objective in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new rigid measures in particular.
The Italian "parents' pattern" Emma Marcagaglia, who will see it tomorrow, also stressed the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, who was quoted for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" representing "the challenge of the serious" and a "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy is expected to be in April 2012 for 200 billion euros of State obligations.
A Russian scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danielenko, helped Iran develop a useful nuclear-weapon-free detonator, claimed a US NGO specializing in nuclear risk Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA participated last week in its "severe concerns" on a "probably military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which was widely used in IAEA documents, Mr. Danielenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamantes" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact Iran's embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its final report, the IAEA refers to "the strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only well-known to this technology, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked on its career in this technology within the military nuclear programme of its country of origin".
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while the other racial and religious violence has slowed down or slowed down, according to the FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violent acts committed against Muslims was from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent increase, 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews, and 14 per cent overall increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," stressed the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the Organization's officials, Paul Legendre.
"The American Government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he added, believing that this could result in improved police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law is an inheritance of the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish racial, skin color, religion, origin and sexual property.
Twitter modifies its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site introduced changes Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those who follow it, which makes its service look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" will allow you to follow more closely, directly, the activities of other "Twittos", the Internet that follow the messages ("tweets") and those that follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being deployed across the Monday network, indicated to the AFP the Twitter password, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive function, with some horticultural terms (RT to recast a message from someone else, #flowfrieday to recommend to follow another user) thus opens to a wider audience with a more comparable approach to large public networks on Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were discussing "tweets" cuts on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, confusing, and it looks too much like Facebook," wrote @jmb123.
"Activity functionality will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
Incorporating a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social-Democratic/Christian Coalition to the Authority in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "gold rule" for reducing public deficits and thus avoid any degradation by the A.A. rating agencies.
It is the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision to him after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but netly below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced only by a single loan from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest per year," argued the vice-president and Christian democratic minister of foreign affairs, Michael Spindeleger.
Austria therefore submits an application for a summit in Brussels of the euro area members of the euro area on 26 October last: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of the same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the German model, Germany being the first European country to adopt such a rule.
As of 2017, the structural public deficit will be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (PIB) each year, and the federal government's structural deficit will not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP every year, while the regional states and municipalities will have budgets to be balanced.
The objective is to make public debt under the 60 per cent criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty at Horizon 2020/21.

Noda threatens a new intervention on the change market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene on the market if the Yen were to continue to mount.
"We will intervene as we have done the last time if we find an excessive volume" in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
Mardi, the yun was not far from the historical levels that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive amounts of coins against dollars in order to lower the value of the Nippanese debt that had been to establish a new record of living since 1945 in front of the green bill.
But the yen has been regularly reimbursed since, twice by the purchases of investors who consider it a "refuge value" at this time of uncertain global economic slowdown and crisis in Europe.
The dollar has been reimbursed under 77 yen and the euro has fallen under the 105- yen symbolic bar, near the levels that have triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost around 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This flame of the Nippane divider night to the export of the archipelago because it will recover the cost of Made products in Japan and reduce the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
" Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the Seismic and Tsunami of 11 March that destroyed the Tohoku region (north-east), pointed out Mr. Noda, who fears that this repurchasing of the Yen will not kill in the wake of the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power has been renewed with growth in the third quarter of the 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a reabundance of exports and consumption of households in the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister ruled that the yin's skin did not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to reduce the deficit.
But the Deputy Director of the Institute, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", letting it be understood that no additional monetary absorption was to wait for Wednesday.
At its last meeting, at the end of October, the Emission Institute increased its sales of EUR 5 billion (EUR 47 billion) to EUR 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) to the ceiling of the amounts it spends on the purchases of various financial securities in order to launch the liquidity market.
Euro area:
floating rates, floating arcs
The risk of contamination of the debt crisis is still low in the European index.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the fragile countries continue to rise.
Always concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Bureaus set up a little more in negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
" With new tensions over the performance of the euro area's loans in difficulty, world-wide markets of action continue to be part of their recent gains " .
" Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional court at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Forum closed at 0.7 per cent, suffering from renewed fear of market participants about Europe's capacity to bear the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a serious variation corridor as long as investors will not have evidence that the situation is stable, " estimates Mitsushige Akino, managing funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This issue of concerns about the future of the euro area is the single currency, which continues to decline tomorrow.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, in excess of 0.4%.
According to the Courts, after the meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, held in Monday, it adopted a motion which, in particular, provides for the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union so far.
Italian and Spanish rates well below 6%
Italy and Spain are still at very alarming levels.
This morning, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years of age is 6.85%, of Spanish titles of the same age of 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to feed the fear of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti claimed time to markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos stated that the implementation of decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the " main task " of his Government.
Spain is on the market line, while elections in the country are taking place on Sunday.
The difference between the 10-year-old obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
In the interest of euro area growth figures
Statistics Finland reported an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, or slightly better than 0.3 per cent in the household consumption.
The Insee, however, revised the second quarter's figure, with a return of 0.1% of gross domestic product (PIB) instead of a parking lot.
And it's really the fourth one who's worried most about the economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission is about to take action against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must be imported on the documents
If it is a matter that we cannot deal with from short-term or short-term considerations, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is wise to make your electoral appointment as an opportunity to reflect on such issues and where the nuclear power is held.
The debate will be useful only if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will lead to a double demand for electricity from here to 2050, with less to occupy a large part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to refurbish fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate pollution, an issue of ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium or Belgium, which submits to the need to find a replacement source that can replace itself or Switzerland, which is just about to build up only the latter generation centres.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote only their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by refurbishing the construction of a broken centre after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is contrary to the speech.
Berlin's choice will be translated by the refurbishment of the electricity price, an energy dependence compounded by the increased demand for imported gas, in particular in Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of gas and coal centres.
In a few months, all of these side effects are already felt.
Denmark's case is to meditate.
Europe's oil champion, which takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest coal and gas users of the fact that the wind is intermittent; its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours acquire a factor of more than 40% electricity to the French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a gap in the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies are benefiting from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of the nuclear power would result in a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful declarations on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of Frances refuse to pay, so that they do not manifest a principle of this energy, the polls show it.
We recall that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build a 125,000 direct and 410,000 direct jobs.
It is highly exporting, it creates a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very job-creators non-delocated.
If France had decided to leave the nuclear power plant, it would have sacrificed a good number of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of French annual exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years while its manufacturer's deceleration would be scheduled?
In order to solve energy equations, it is necessary to admit that there is no source of production of miracle electricity, no more than there is no Devil.
The development by Areva of low emissions of CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions testifies to the complementaryness of energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Security Authority which carries out intransigence and transparency on existing centres such as the Flamanville Cantaire.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are accustomed to the same security obsessation.
In a half century, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
One alone, Three Mile Island, has intervened in normal operating conditions; it remains without human or environmental consequences.
In Tchernobyl, the design of the reactor and the improbable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of an unprecedented magnitude that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take away the teachings of this accident, as it did for the two previous generations.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German constructioners, the EPR presents a concept that makes it possible to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians that would like to build a centre, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them free to compare leadership in the incontinuous nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the "emotion, doctrines and manoeuvres" dominate a debate that is also crucial to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised in various English - in particular the police, judicial and administrative services submitted to the digital policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "human rights countries".
More recently, it is the administrative arrest of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Release of May 23) declaring that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant servants".
But it is only rarely analysed under the economic angle.
There is a lot of consensus on this matter between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that "900000 workers should not be a problem in a country with about 2 million immigrants", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish bombers was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that it is supposed to be granted to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande sings to the banals, indicating that co-development will help solve our "migrating problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be selective; but it is economically costly.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book highlighting the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exclusive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restrict anonymous immigration to growth and night employment.
Fearers of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to be replaced by national workers, especially the underqualified, by pressure on their salaries.
However, experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, which are used to make important use of measurables in employment sectors.
Low-qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not affect national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training is no longer a job offer.
A Positive Effect on Salaries
In the same way that a surgeon will have a bad job in a country known as an anesthetics, these supplements between national and migrant immigrants have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of the migration flows would result in an increase of 0.6% and 0.9% of the real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among the Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, with an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that, in Germany, a 30-year-old immigrant will make a net contribution of EUR 150,000 to public budgets on average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his mandate, to go looking for missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, using to discourage immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remaining to think of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for his invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had known the tragedies of the Great War, of Totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Goullag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonies in Greece.
Some believed that it would be sufficient, so that democracy would ultimately triumph over its enemies, exercise the vote, and exercise it in the most direct manner.
Since Napoleon's "the Little" we know it was an easy idea to think about.
The universal suffering, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not enough and can even be "a tool of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, Light, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is a crisis of politics and democracy first and foremost.
In this regard, the real Greek referendum will have the value of double revelation: the need for a strong return from politics, but also the feeling that it is impossible to do so.
This ambivalentity must be considered to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle are now being moved, and that, for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized in the interest of the needs and in scattered order.
A white-seing in the absolute European monarchy or a joined-up sand in the empty nationalist repl. What choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to be involved but a common exercise, full of law, serene and continuous, of choice and of democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there would be no more where to stop enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that falls under the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe that is humble on the international scene.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but this is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the piloting of the European project to popular sovereignty.
As a whole, Europeans will be able to reduce their debt, free markets and prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will entail decisions at European level that will not be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, unless we are sure to lead to disaster.
After a long fight against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world today complains about the European economic government.
Come on.
But thinking without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new follicle and a new impassion.
We must take a new step towards European construction.
In order to make the Republic of France, it was necessary to "make" the Republicans.
The Revolution in interest could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe on the economic level.
This will only be possible by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, we make Europeans.
Cards in stock "without Contact" are available
The world map room opens Tuesday in Villapinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The 2011 year should actually end with an increase of 11% of world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card phone...) to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is the technology without contact that allows the public transport to be paid or to regulate its purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million cards are to be sold across the world, against 320 million a year earlier!
Their share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10 per cent of the global market in the market for paper in powder (6,925 million cards).
In the long run of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe receives land for payment without contact.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double shoes.
This year 2.5 million cards pass MasterCard without contact.
In order to pass on to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have undertaken to disseminate to their customers their bank cards with no contact,” announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
No devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to perform transactions.
"They took the delay."
"But they should finally know a real issue next year."
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the fronts.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a December-June test in Cain.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a test that allows payment without contact.
The ECB has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said yesterday to prepare the market for an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phones.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram section.
Long-term suspects, the links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group to the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian section Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Alger has now "acquired the truth".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without any further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation on the rapt of two French in Niger in January would have taken place on the day of the passengers.
Kidnaped in a Niamey restaurant by Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day as many of their rapists during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the decoupling of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone stations belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of past appeals to several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in researchers: one month to a Nigerian who lived long in Maiduguri, one city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram's Berceau, and the other to a man who called himself close to Akqmi and the section.
"It is a progress, but there is no doubt a need to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the section has received external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," says a Nigerian researcher named Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months these "apois" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of more complex camikaze or explosive devices and the same factor as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, then pressed on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of low-interest lightings.
A Speedy Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist faith Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haousasa " Western education is a sin" - the establishment of an Islamic empress in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It policies and demands strict respect for the charia while its military forces engage in the fight against the corrupt central government.
These last are primarily churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's militias were particularly active, multiplying attacks against the commissions.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, unwelcome.
The army invested the city, we're counting 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
So in the section, it's going to radicalise and leave its leaves in the north.
In the last Christmas, she's paying attention to 80 deaths in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram took her to the secure QG of the police during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now concerned about all security specialists.
While Akmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Cebab worked in Kenya, Boko Haram appeared as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé took a stand against Boko Haram and said he was "to share all the information".
The World According to Republican candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on Israel's help, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are inseparable from simplicity and ignorance.
Can an American weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple ideas, do you want simple?
In listening to the Republican presidential candidates, the electors could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have multiplied tonering statements and reports on foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on Israel's help, the Sloans - often not stopped - fled.
Mitt Romney, the best position in the "Grand Old Party" course, threatened to train Chinese in front of the WTO and cause them to be "manipulating their currency", a leading theme in an American exposed to the migration of the entire breads of his industry to Asia.
So bad if this should involve the outbreak of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China of Obama and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed to face an attitude that "flags" the emotions.
He called for a muscle but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depth of the polls, remains unheard of.
To Reagan's Image
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran, he'll be defeated."
"If Obama is real, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance in Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil its obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second candidate of the best place, shows him an overwhelming ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called against the Chinese military threat because Pékin "he tries to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has been holding the military atom since 1964!
The German Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks on Iran, said he was ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The application for torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recognized by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents claim that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too early departure of Iraq's "boys" on its terrorist attacks in Libya, thus calling it a weak label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population is rather optimistic about Obama's national security balance, which has removed Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been hated for military intervention leading to education.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to raise its leadership, Obama is more just.
The North Stream, new Russian gas entrance door in Europe
The North Stream Gasoduc, directly connecting Western Europe to Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million barrels.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with excitement.
More than 500 invitations from four Heads of State and Government participated, last Tuesday, on the Baltic side, between orchestra and final buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, this new gasoduc that directly links Russia to Germany under the sea.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the first French Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, turned together from the valve, directing the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gasoduc, 27.5 billion additional Russian gas cubes will be reached each year in Western Europe by the first tube of 1,224 km from the Saint Petersburg region in the Country of Meckleburg-Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, allowing the total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we already discussed the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and in time of this huge singing field has winning airs.
The project was strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream is going to allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to pass on Russia by threatening to close access to the Western European markets.
At the strongest of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream with a " new German-Soviet-Soviet pact " in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This is whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supply.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia's vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which, in five years' time, has been a thing of the past, has been a reflection of its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, very gas consumers, and whose stocks are in decline.
"This Gazoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new art that we are organically located," said François Fillon by innovating it, showing how large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles shown by the leaders of Gazprom, who are present in large numbers in Lubmin at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical operation.
The sub-marine tube is an oil-winned concrete to protect it from the waves of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, 200 m in the middle.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid mines from the Second World War.
" A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by caution," says Jens Müller, a spokesman of Nord Stream company.
There was also a need to expand the measures to protect the forest and the forest.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel tower, which does not interrupt any of its length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned throughout Sweden, but the project officials rejected it while the Swedish people were unwilling to see a Russian State company permanently established along their coasts.
"In case of summer, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gasduc is then released in the air.
However, this case is unlikely to have been judged by the builders who had planned the Soudres to find a escape every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the Gaza Strip is provided by a submarine, trained by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circles within the Gaza Strip.
From the form of a cigarette, it is inserted inside the tube, width of a diameter meter, and is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at 3 m/h, he provides specific information on possible metal deformations.
The gasduc has been designed to operate for 50 years without having to make the minimum repairs.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars from the start, and 100 from the arrival.
Five companies have united their efforts to achieve this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the parties.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the gas pipeline.
She has her seat in Zuug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then commended this company for the total capacity of gas transport for twenty years.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was secured by 30 per cent by shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach €7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas doc emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sablonic litoral plant of pins.
Valves, heights of 4.5 meters, form the gas exit door.
Captors measure the pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas that occurs before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million meters of Russian gas cubes per hour.
In full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wanted to restore the taste of writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, hours past to write in the light of a bubble.
The Moleskine carnet is easily recognized, with its black rectangle cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as old as time.
However, the Moleskine Carnet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a card of design but distinguished notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an old production technique, the mollusc (free of tips) that identifies a green cotton used to cover banknotes, for example.
This kind of carnet was very popular for writers and travelers.
"Moleskine delivered to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of pre-garde artists, until the 20th and 20th centuries " , says Maria Sebregondi, who has been responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent to 12.7 million school-rooms.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 carnets were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to establish the buyer's robot's portrait, because the notebook also sat down both the businessman and the student and professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open mind and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, is almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her wallets in the libraries, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre and has its identity.
" We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the source of e-mails " , explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanys the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Down " where architects or artists exhibit their own cartoons.
In August, she also launched a oleopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and of this cultural era, Moleskine has to diversify its products: bags, agenda, styles, computer doors... The brand comes down on a range of support.
A success that has been achieved: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still two times higher than the average: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the entire population.
Disturbing?
" No, notes Eric Blancchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of disabled people. "
" The progress that has been made for 15 years is considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
" Nevertheless, it remains enormously still to be done."
It must be said that for disabled drivers, obstacles remain many before accessing employment.
They are rather older: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the back and 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very slow: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
Bref, so many criteria that make it difficult to return to employment alone, which " constitutes the cause of the problem ", according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
That's for the target brakes.
It remains the non-edit, the thoughts that evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Completed Association for the City indicated that the requested managers have " a low level of knowledge of the disabled " with a " super-representation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, more than 20 private companies are still far from reaching the employment target of 6 per cent of workers with disabilities, as set out in a Act of... 1987.
The last known figures, which came in 2008, were 2.6 per cent.
" We are now around 3 per cent," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting the contributions of companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxes " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc. "
" But this improvement also means a genuine awareness-raising approach, particularly in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of 20 to 49 employees are employed by disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a blessing"
Before facing the Blue Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of looking for this friendly match.
We won't until we write that he had the harmony between them, but the image is symbolic.
Assis is on the left side on the street of the Auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have enjoyed and made peace.
Five months after the humor management of his attack on Turkey, the Belgian elector has only a lot to do with his subject.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is beautiful."
"I want to go ahead," says Lillois on his side.
As for the contrast between its performances in the club and selection, "it's all right, it's all right."
"A Lille, I've been there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Manned against Romania Friday night for this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
However, not to mention the notion of "satisfying".
The Bleus has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been sustained," he says.
It is strongly involved in strengthening the "participative" character of this meeting.
As far as he's concerned, "he's Mathieu (Debuchy), Johann (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), he's called him.
"It's all crossed in time."
"You can play against them, that's nothing but happiness!"
With bonamium, Leekens has for his part called "fertility."
"Finished" to argue "a match of gala."
"Ferté" also notes - as a "visin" - that France "has become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's traumatism.
"Laurent Blanc did a toner job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, it would be good for the technician to share the plane with the Blues Direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are becoming big," he pointed out.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to pay attention to it in the next match." That against France is included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento started with many optimistics his barrague back to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams had lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento has already seen it in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Selecçao, which has been on the menu since September 2010, will qualify for the euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an enemy, Bosnia, to break down.
In view of the game going (0-0), Friday in the fire of Zenica, it seemed obvious that the games were not done.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this goal as valuable, which would have been relieved.
"It's a good result, however, which presents a certain risk because we haven't marked out a goal abroad."
But among them, in their bright stages of the Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public who should also be working there, even though the part clearly announces "very closed", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We are waiting for a very closed match, but we are convinced that we can take it up," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance to be in the euro 2012," even when Carlos Queiroz's successor was involved.
Bosnia's Ninth Report obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It is a good result, however, which poses a certain risk because we did not mark the outside," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has many technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to introduce a maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to reflect."
A good idea, provided you're realistic, this time.
