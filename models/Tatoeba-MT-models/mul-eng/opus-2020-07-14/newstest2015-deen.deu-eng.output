The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been visiting his first important foreign visit since his election in May to discuss economic and security relations with his Japanese colleagues Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.
Mr Modi is on a five-day journey to Japan to establish economic relations with the world's largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger technical cooperation are above the agenda.
In addition to reports, India is looking forward to a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police arrest 20-year-olds after fast motorcyclejacking
After the driver had driven it 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and by Buschland to get the police out of Bilbar.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had observed it, as it left a tank station on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and went on the Burgess Road before he left in the Buschland, where the officers lost it from the eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who spoke to the driver’s description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha's police accuses a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal as well as unattended driving.
He will appear before the court on 23 September in Karratha.
The engine wheel was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster due to hotel abuses in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands in court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged with a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is charged with the rape of a woman at the Scottish Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The complaint indicates that Webster attacked her, while she "was unconscious, silent, and could not signal an understanding."
Wester will also be asked to strengthen a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in Scotland on May 4, 2014.
The Court of Justice, Lady Rae, signed the negotiations for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Relating to the very American idea of labour rights as human rights
The Congressmans Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as a citizen.
"As trade unions die, so do the middle class jobs," said Elison, a democracy from Minnesota and the deputy president of the progressive Caucus at the Congress.
That is why I congratulate my colleague John Lewis, along with the civil rights officer.
This criminal law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-working forces.
The supplementing of the national labour law to create an opportunity for workers who are discriminated against to organize a trade representation in order to appeal before a civil court to obtain justice - and to receive damages or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But there is certainly no radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellisson, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposals propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the withdrawals that the trade unions had suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have been encouraged to recognize, extend and retain labour rights in all countries.
There was a time when millions of Americans were still reminded of this country’s declaration of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right of association in an atmosphere.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the hedki Tojos militaryized autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the role of workers and their trade unions in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed by union and joint trade and trade."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and have to raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause which explicitly asserted: "The right to establish unions in order to ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed by each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements restricting or restricting this right are null and void; they are illegal.
When the former President, Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, took the initiative on the International Commission for Human Rights, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "every person has the right to form or participate in or participate in cooperation in the protection of his interests."
Since generations Americans have accepted the principle that labour rights are human rights.
As this country encourages other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans say that the right to establish a trade union - and that it should be protected from collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights have been taken up in America under the decision, it is indeed very wise to rethink the American ideal, so the working population must have the right to unite and become members of a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said five years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labour movement has not limited the strength of the nation, but it has increased.
Through the introduction of the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a market for industry in a wonderful way and has raised the whole nation to an unprecedented level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story reminds us, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the rights of citizens as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employment contracts - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that the Americas have made in the past and have broken the promise of democracy.
The Court of Justice has temporarily suspended the law that all decommissioning clinics in Louisiana could be forced to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge suspended the application of a law in Louisiana, stating that it might have led to the conclusion of all five state-run clinics.
This measure, which was adopted by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana in June, and should enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors to take the abortions, in order to force a patient to receive a prescription at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the decision of the Director means that doctors can continue to carry out legal proceedings while applying for such a right.
"The complainants may continue to work in accordance with the law while striving to exercise these rights," wrote Federal Justice John de Gravelles in his judgment.
Within one month a hearing will be held for judges to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Derogations were welcomed by the most recent decision in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors had spent so much time in order to obtain hospital registration rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana have a permanent law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and President of the reproductive rights centre, who was accused on behalf of three of the five public clinics in order to uphold the law.
It was not clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and also applied for the right of informed consent.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries that have adopted similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitutional reasons.
The closure of a law in Texas, which had forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close, was terminated by a federal judge on Friday.
The applicant and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that the rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
In contrast, measures to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out operations in Louisiana has patient rights, shared the reproductive rights centre.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to do so, no further interruptions would be allowed, the doctor would not be afraid to perform the operation for his safety, the group said.
In its argument against the judgment, the representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not be punished by doctors because of the conduct of abortions, while their applications for patient rights would still be limited.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of death by Eierstock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have set up a video game for their mother online, who died in 2007 at Eierstockkrebbs.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from eirstock cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who were diagnosed with Eirstock cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent of the five years after the diagnosis were still in existence.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines may delay lung and kidney cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman was affected by the diagnosis, the type of kidney cancer, the present disease, and the social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed to the diagnosis point, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk was 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas during the study.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city die of higher risk of eerstock cancers, Dr. Jordan suggests a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecologists, and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the removals, they proposed, as a possible aid, strengthening the service of local doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer access to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independent of geographical status, gave women a bad long-term life rate and stressed the need for better treatment and care strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had a aggressive form of Eierstockkrebbs.
Case sensitive houseowners
The return together with an increased decline in the number of households under 35 years could lead to the loss of ten thousand cents per year if today’s young consumers report on a study of HTA, as in the Financial Times, the "Kernel Group for Garden Products".
The report states that renters spend an average of 55 per cent of their income on people with their own homes.
The increase in people living in high urbanised areas without gardening, the preferred procedure to simplify plans for parking and the fragile garden sizes are further factors that threaten the industry, estimated at £5 billion annually.
In London, London, where the share of households fell from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the minimum expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can't draw plants.
Guy Barter, head of the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in a turn."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden period" of the garden retail trade due to increasing household and economic well-being from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted a improved market situation for this year because of the better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The opposition politician Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri protest movement in Pakistan continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stolen the state television transmitter PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have forced the protesters from PTV buildings again.
The sender started his operation for about 40 minutes, but it sent again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a mile away, they delivered themselves with sticks and stones equipped with safety forces.
The police set up a train.
The demonstrators asked Sharifs to go back, but he did.
The country's army therefore has a political solution to the conflict, "with no time to waste and use no violence".
After a meeting in the main room on Sunday afternoon, the military said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more frequently.
The opposition politician Imran Khan invites Prime Minister Sharif to participate in the parliamentary election last May.
The Protestants were expelled on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their allies to order Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomats for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commissioned the country's largest US diplomats to report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine The mirror as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan took note of the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that the most important secret service in Germany had Ankara in the visa also provided for significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warnstreik: Loctors with consequences for Pendler
The federal warning line of the Lokführer at Montagabend could also affect the traffic of people in NRW.
The airport announced for 18 to 21 hours shall cover all transport companies, including distance, regional and S-road traffic,
The main direction of the warning line is the freight traffic.

said the Regional President of the German Association of Lolomotive Drivers (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're counting on major incidents.
Regional priorities do not give rise to this.
The main direction of the warning line is the freight traffic.
The German train in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as small as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where they want to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences.
Police chief of the magaluf of corruption accused
On Friday, the prosecutors presented to the government office of Mallorca evidence of arrests by police officers and agents in the city of Calvià.
The chief of the Calvià police on the Malorca holiday was arrested after corruption by business people and bar owners in the famous Binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was charged with corruption against him by several business people from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented to the government office for the fight against corruption Malorcas on Friday evidence of arrests by police and the city of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the purposes of corruption and were questioned together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the late night club owners claimed that the veterinary economy of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about money services anymore, it's about survival," said one of the business people to the court.
Let us get our basics out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made international hits due to a viral YouTube video showing a 18-year-old British tourist, who had completed 24 men during a vacation tour of Fellatio.
The island authorities have either tried to stop the orderly behaviour of the alcoholic holiday in Magaluf by reducing the number of participants to the popular alcoholic beverages.
The Playhouse Club, in which the fella accident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the Kneipentour-Organiser Carnage together had to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular in the young British holiday resorts, is also known for various accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing" when people jump from a balcony to another or a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of breakfast with nose and storm conditions affected flights from Adelaide Airport
SOUTHING has protected South Australia's winter surprise, with heavy guards and strong winds that affected the flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening, up to 21 hours more 5mm of rain falls on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already been down in the night to Sunday.
The last snowfall was the result of a series of short, smurmish viewers, including a cave which started just 20 hours ago and lasted for almost 4mm of snowfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided for an early dose of breakfast, the temperature in the city again came to a maximum of 15.8°C on Monday.
The higher weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft should have landed shortly after 19.30 a.m., but was hit by a storm - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to begin.
Windstorms reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to start on a second flight and finally set up about 20.40 hours.
The delay led to forgotten some other flights, including an Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is expected on Tuesday, with possible viewers.
Mathies means: Highest Time for Large Networks
In view of the enchanting technical progress that makes our pleasant home transformed into high-tech switch centres, our Colonist Bernd Mathies is pleased with a highly trusted electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my view is on the spiral cable, which connects the ear to the phone, and I think: Boah, how is retro is that?
But then there's a clue: If the cable hadn't been, all the ears would have flown safely back in the house in a short time, and that would still be more retro.
In addition, it applies to the ekeletronic (keletronic?
No, typing error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world's newness from today's electrocrotch from tomorrow is bought - old.
And whoever today, for example, has a smoker in the living room, who just says he's basically refused television.
Why are these transfers?
Because this week, our absolute incompetence to the issue of electronics brings us to the attention of the Ifa at the turn of the clock.
The Laie, who used to manage the former washing machine and CD players blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that will be extended to him with unfavourable expert talks: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, it's still going?
What should you talk to people who open up such a quark voluntarily?
In principle, it has been some 20 years before, in particular, that we should be able to connect our house.
In order for the yoghurt to be self-contained, the fire alarm informs us at the holiday on the Maldives that it burns in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office from the climate situation on our cheap arrival ...?
Yes, but this is a climate situation.
But a dream will certainly come true at first: We lift our armpits, say "Saugen!" - and at home the dust-grabots go away.
Come on.
Everything runs on nothing smaller than a revolution: "Swift the boundaries between white and brown goods," a factory identifier ran out, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam garage sends the weather report and shows how long the pizza in the oven is still needed, but it doesn't work because we're in town.
We also know from the daily practice: If a modern device is used very quickly, the battery is guaranteed empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable will also survive the next functional exhibitions on the phone.
Israeli children go back to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, during the rockets and massacres in their communities during the 50th day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza, while the area was occupied by the fighting.
The school started bringing joy and hope to the communities marked by rocket shells in southern Israel, but the signs of the wars are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the "Passhosh" children's garden, who were hit by a rocket, took off before the students arrived from the walls and sideways of the ship.
"We've got a little fear, but they're upset," said Ronit Bart, a resident in the Kibbutz Saad and a local English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Your 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt like "a little funny" to go back to school.
"That was difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to provide his support.
For the last week of the war, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad in their homes or left their homes to move safely from Gaza and to escape the rocket and deadly fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border to Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian Morsegranate, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily transferred to other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza that is severely affected by the Palestinian decision.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that your knowledge is acquired and provides you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on the last service day to a standstill.
The gunfire provided for an immediate end to the war; however, important problems remain unsolved, as the demand for Hamas after a suspension of the Israeli-Aghiptic blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of the Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in battle.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three fourths of civilians, and at least 494 children were killed at the expense of Palestinians and the UN.
Israel seeks this information and appreciates that at least half of the victims are fighting, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza burned 4,591 rockets and munitions during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military led more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or damaged thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were built in temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and cease fighting, the education authorities have changed the beginning of the school year over the past week.
"I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can learn more, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After selection in cases: CDU-Vize Strobl asks NPD prevention procedures
In view of the loss of voice from the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl spoke for an end to the ongoing NPD opposition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should be finalized.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also head of the CDU country in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzier People's News".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me more aware of the outcome of the political struggle between the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was almost broken up in the five-percent garden on Sunday when the vote was voted.
The first ban on the right-wing party was lifted in 2003 because the constitutional protection was also in the NPD-spitze.
In December 2013, the Federal Council issued a new application in Karlsruhe after long-term preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Republic of Germany are not closed.
Harburg: Rare for New Refugees
In the New Zealand, refugees are now being deported to cells.
The Central Recovery for Refugees in Harburg is located in all the snow.
The internal authority has now set up three cells of the red circle.
The local politicians were first informed - they were little impressed.
"These hauruck actions further undermine the citizens' reservations and give the local politicians no opportunity to work constructively towards the humanisation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, president of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party calls for the regional administration of Harburg to make use of now unused houses for supply.
96 refugees can be transferred to the three cells.
Reasons for filling in the recovery are the supply of aid seekers - and the condition that the authorities can provide not enough seats in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The main prizes have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a clearly observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for owners in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
This increase is the total increase in June, July and August at 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, twice as high as the increase in 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not distributed equally over the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne are pursuing a double market.
The figures from RP Data show that the prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rise by an average of five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been severely affected by government expenditure cuts and where prices increase only by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless further said that by the beginning of the morning there would be an increase in the real estate for the next month, which would be subject to "a real test".
"If one takes into account the sudden high rate of auction prices, a general fast sales rate and the sudden low interest rate, it is likely that the own income will continue to increase in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the new press, he rejected the statements of the manager of the company, Peer Medau, and testified to this "as a Fieldlord".
The school's style is not that, it's in the message.
So if the Medau family has already been informed about the views of the University of Medau with June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely false," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that there is no "preventions or even decisions" in the plans, but there is "preferences".
Also, the development of the small road beyond the castle is less dramatic than that of the Medaus.
It was a nine-metre wide street, and it's not the talk.
It goes to the current position of 5.50 meters, which is a meter wider than before," Pötzl explains.
The argument of the Medau employees that their free and school parking areas will be used in the future only by students of the school will not be allowed to apply to Pötzl.
It will not be allowed to enter the park because it can be resolved intelligently as in other public parks.
Think of the Resident
The children's brigade, which is located on the ground and will take the journey to the park, should "not be affected," according to the President of the University.
There are many more to think about, "that this is not only about the children's steps here, but also about the people at the entrance to the Friedrich-Streib Street Street and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
It is therefore much more than the partial interests of Mr Medau," Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parentheses of the children, with the development of the street, would be entitled "to lose a few natural-bed spots of Coburgs", "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the constructive development of the University by 2020 "and to this end the importance of the new solution".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's seizures last week about the plans of the college.
In the meantime, the journey to the new parking lot should not be as far as through the campus and the Friedrich Streib Street, but through the Medau mountain.
To do this, the small road had to be constructed twice a kilometer.
According to the estimates of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be reduced.
From about 2000 vehicles every day, the talk is.
From the side of the city, you did not want to go out to the project.
Glandorf withdraws from the National Mission of Handball
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31st year of the Federal List of Gs Flensburg-Handewitt led to this decision in particular health problems.
The decision has not been easy for me, it's been over a few months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the National Mission," the World Master shared in 2007 on his Facebook page.
So he goes with a balance of 167 country games and 576 towers for Germany in international peace.
Because the professional backroom player for the champions-League winner from Flensburg has been wanting to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the islander who announced his role on Tuesday for the country games against Switzerland, Glenlandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and ideas have impressed me just as they have been impressed by my longtime players and my followers.
But for my club, I would also like to be available healthy in the coming years, for which longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which do not allow the current double load.
The left-hand man had to fear his career after a concussion infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles' problems, he had been able to treat himself with a cortisone sprite that had subsequently been eliminated by German team doctors (DHB).
A note-perception and two more inputs followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the human race, which concluded the settlement with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national civil service careers go to no body without question.
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infections-related foot operations that occurred in short distances in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right in the grip.
In this regard, there are several other complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I have noticed that I control my head, but my body cannot hide," Glandorf explained in an interview with the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be in absolute emergency.
"When all the lights are up, I'm always ready to talk," the two family guests explained to the professional magazine.
However, I can count on the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become very depressed about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a few steps.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the 2014 award of the League Championships, he held the EHF Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured himself with Flensburg to the European populace of the Pocalsieger.
German economy by 0.2 per cent broken in the spring
The crises around the globe have broken the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent.
It shared with the Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only the consumer lived the economy in the spring, while the investments returned.
The external trade also brought the conjunctration to a halt.
Thanks to the strong annual budget, a total GDP plus 0.8 per cent in the first half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Munsterland-Mooiste", which was first held on Sunday by the City of Burgmanns.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of the Dutch "Fiezen Driver" on Sunday.
The largest railway link in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Munsterland Mooste".
In this regard, it is the largest railway station throughout Münster, the railway paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos der Hueren for the organisation of this round trip through the Münster country.
In various professional journals, this tour was offered interested.
We come from the Heller and are traveling through the night to take part in this journey.
We also want to learn more about this kind of country," the drivers rejoice over the route through the streets of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the Federal Court of Justice Sta.
Katharina went to a small "peace Road" through the city over the wall, where the start was also successful.
Further, the route, written for three different categories, led by Herrenholz on the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and on Havisbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On the route of 95 kilometers with 1175 altitudes, 120 kilometers with 1475 altitudes and 145 kilometers with 1775 altitudes, the drivers show their good condition.
They were bound on their way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos der Huerne and Mayor of Heinz Lölfing showed great satisfaction at the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all of us.
The organization loved no problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing says a positive phase of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer expected, which was probably on the bad weather forecast and on the morning rain.
"We will see us again in the summer of 2015 at a pleasant weather on 30 August or during another weekend," but the driver promises to return to Münster, and the organizers plan a new flag.
Konstantin Weckers Unhappily Real Memory
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, singer, pacifist, political activist, former prisoner, in "Montenegro and War" on 287 pages to paper.
Not chronologically, but more thought festivals for meditation festivals have been signed by Munich's memory on 1 June 1947, each chapter is inserted by an appropriate song text.
And he is honest with himself: from the onion as a Gymnasian, to the thief, and to the drug consumption, he leaves no human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide spaces also take abstracts, but so much more important concepts: love, soul, ego, who is present, spirituality - all he tries to go on the basis of, very philosophical, but also very personal.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also, as he did not only the music (the opera player became a sun and rock musician), but also his prison life.
Finally, the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also brought near the Asketian coin, which is "by subtraction", as he says, "to remove everything unnecessary."
Among all the high-level views, there are also short anecdotes to the ground: about skiings in a local frequented by GIs or a walking car, where he showed a tree at the front.
He's honest with you, too.
Lenny Henry: My father didn't take me into the army.
Didn't say "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is trying for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with live melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is deeply concerned about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to get to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice, "Hear him with your strength.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - walked with him into the shoes and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket glass.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life was this toughest type in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a gate in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father’s time, he gained an insight into how life could have been for him.
It's now a little light, but they're dark, confused, deep-sticky labyrinths with flame waves and smoke and lots of noise.
My father was early in the day, and then you could hear him slowly how he started singing because he could wash the dishes from himself.
When I came back there, it became clear to me that he had done it for years to bring the food to the table, and my attention in front of him was increased.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father didn't bother me, he didn't say "I love you."
As soon as it went wrong with my mother at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop making fun of me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still a friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Down is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That's what helped her to die.
So when I became very, very heavy and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "They must be radical.
So I went through this fitness, and I also had to make a drastic diet to convert the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's intense.
No one likes Karotten.
Henry's career change may be shown in his elegant, short cut bar.
Since being invited by the critics for his Othello, he has been joined by the Theater.
It followed the comedy of the raids, and then the funds of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedys who have fulfilled their business life.
He started working in a factory when he was 16 years old.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventh year. "I was for a very long time the only black Imitator/Comedian on television."
He's a student in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up before the eyes of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I was able to become an efficient witness history machine, while I was a star by television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager has the right to run at the Black and White Minstrel Show, an easy maintenance program in which people have "blackmailed", Henry led his Comedy up there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wanted something that would never happen, but I'm not sure I did.
It was a unique, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on rice projects with and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-old priced light wave of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that inspired both the British black culture and celebrated, Henry worked in the eight viewers at an alternative comedy circle.
The first row of Lenny Henry Show was sent in 1984, and he was known among the nine-year-olds as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chief!.
Advertisement, documentary films, TV series and film roles appeared next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought, "What do you do as next, Len, because it all feels like you're just giving time or getting a little bit on the spot?"
Then came a series of documents for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first is about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was a regular allergic.
I never really learned about him at school and held him for a domain of the middle class, white in fluorescent hooves and a cool head in front of it.
So I was very worried about it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it again.
Don't do anything wrong if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry took 20 lines from Othello's last talk for the documentary and was excited.
I felt like I could make it.
It was almost as if someone had put my head in the right direction.
"That's why it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, search for a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece a month before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seem to expect a car crash, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he's in the comedy of surprises.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinct that he should keep the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to go 10 minutes now while it repairs the computer."
Instead, the tour guide announced that the presentation continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, God, thank you."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can let someone else go.
"You play in a theater, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for finance was challenging.
Panik is very good, it strengthens the eyes.
That's also good, so it's like a big picture of the gods who say to me, "This is your determination here."
He says this, of course, with a DONERNED voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is through humorous outbursts, while he always imitates people again.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction of a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're looking for it all the time, you're going ahead of a wall.
I sometimes get alive in Apollo when I have fun, but I don't have as much as before.
I'll ask him if he'll make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The pleasure I have in a room with a director, who helps to form a start, a part, and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to do that again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I'd like to be a actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Swiss Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi-Angger had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a speaker of the Huthi Party said "Ansar Allah".
The approach to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic accident in the capital.
According to the online release of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi-Führer Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for action on Sunday afternoon.
Huthi regretted the statement of the bill with another scalding of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Swiss Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni-regulated Yemen and demand the return of the government.
The Huthi people's tribe has been in possession of the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the great roads of Sanaa.
In the country, there are still bloody wars with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers offices to include "resurrected"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to remove "represented" from the government's budget list.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay a government statement.
The government argues that tens of thousands of people are still receiving payment from public service after their departure.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his office in 2013.
At the beginning of this year, it was found that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 £) per month had been lost in payments for "reimbursed" and other abused financial practices.
The government suspects that hostages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wadanga Chebusiri to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at the identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is included in a government message.
All those who did not do this without a credible apology would be cut off from the balance sheet, the message continued to be heard.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by establishing the actual number of employees and also clarifying the balance sheet at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "set-up"," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal against the artistic consultant Helge Achenbach will be discussed for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five inheritances from Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, require a civilian process at Düsseldorf County Court of Justice 19.4 million euros of damage by Achenbach and two of its companies that are in insolvency proceedings.
This was shared by a judge on Monday.
In the classic book, Achenbach has been involved in the purchase of works of art and age, and Berthold Albrecht calculates purchase prices higher than actually paid.
This would also have resulted in a higher incidence of the agreed commission.
Achenbach has purchased for 121 million Euros of value for Albrecht.
Children need whales and birds
For 44 years he served 23 of them as a teacher.
Since then, Manfred Richter has known many Peterhouses and Kolbachers from his time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried out by his efforts to see people in his school.
The snowflake is the most famous mountain in the Riegong Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive of his home.
Director was born in 1930 in Trauteau/Northbeam, today Trutnov.
He had already been interested in education after four years.
A year later, the Southern Germans were eligible.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her home.
After a few months in a camp, it arrived in 1946 in Bayern - in Güterwagon.
So it led the judge into the U.S. Senate village.
The education took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, where three kilometers across the city go to school and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter arrived in a Rot-Creuz home in Bamberg with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951, he conducted the first and three years after his second state exam.
Since he had no free teaching positions, he went to Oberbayern and joined the school in Kolbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Früulein-Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he attended a three-room service in the newly built teaching house near the school.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school was dissolved in Kolbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Colbach in the Petershausen College and five in Petershausen.
From the year 1968/69, these were collected in Petershausen in today's Rathaus.
When the Indersdorf school was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
To get back to the lower school, the former Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew up, and thus the children and their teachers were able to refer to today's building, which was extended after the Director's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who also built a factory at Community expense and, at the 1997 expansion, although this was not possible under the School Building Guidelines.
"Citizen Master God was very friendly," remembered the judge thankfully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a reference to a schoolmate about justice and justice: "I can never forget love." Manfred Rector said what he heard there as a young teacher.
"I have to give the children two ways: wings and birds," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "This doesn't always work." Whether he means only his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Director Tun was sometimes unconventional.
If the students were to examine themselves, they did not receive any punishment from him, nor were they tempted to sit next to him.
At the expense of the community, the judge had allowed two couple of boxing shoes to be created and allowed the two competitors to act against each other, even if there was to be a chance.
For the benefit of the school, judges as Rector placed a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partiose judge after his retirement to apply at least in 1996 on the CSU list for the Community Council.
However, the judge was elected six in place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers are located in Bad Salzhausen and Schotten Interstopps
If Radler takes off his tour in Bad Salzhausen or shots, that's nothing special to himself.
On Friday, however, only the number of savings came to an end: the 700 participants of the hr4-Rajdour and the accompanying trois enjoyed a break in the basement of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radel and celebrate on newly discovered roads between Ninda and Kinzig" the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there lived a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the Radlers took the first step, 60 kilometers across the city to Bad Salzhausen and further to shooting in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen of the Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed by the owner of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Swing Doöring.
In order to refresh the bodies and spirits, all the good things were prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Lower Mockstadt had 85 bleche apples, zwetchen, streusel and cheesekuchens that could be wonderful to the famous bikers.
"That kind of kitchen can only hold rural women," praised a participant from Aulundibech, while he ordered another piece.
During the drinking season of the Towerveren Geich-Nidda, cold refreshments could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" includes visitors with famous melodys from operas and musicals and excited applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed exciting.
A gentleman recently passed a head massage from his partner: "He has earned it, he has finally reconfirmed broken bicycle chains today."
Therefore, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed on the bridge before the smoking hall of reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to hire in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Similarly, the Chief of Promotion, Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-Raidur 2004 as a tour guide, could only spread briefly, but he had enough to do with the technology in place.
His pickup pressure, in which he communicated with his staff three telephones and a function device with his staff and the 15-capable motorcycle staff of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and reported, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhein Main Area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulla, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in West Fallen, the driver is anxious.
The number of participants shall be a little after the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, participants are presented in hotels, in Category II in Assembly meetings.
In short, the wheels had a good impression when they went back and forth in half an hour, saying, "Shut!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waited for a divorce.
After arriving in Scotland, the group continued to take a short break.
But at night the Radlers were invited to the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the reign of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival environment and, of course, it had been prepared for the lakes, such as flame-kicking fields with good cooled federal whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Vice-President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his role as member of the ADAC Hessen Towering Board, welcomed the visitors.
The three appeared to be pleased with the "many operations in shock".
D.J. Tobias Hagen subsequently released the dancers.
The opportunity to move under the free sky was used in spite of the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, there were increasing suspicions of citizens who were also affected by the good vote as well as the large shield of the driver.
On the second day, the trainers stood at the stations in Birstein, Wächersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the train halls - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of Radelns, the sportsmen are back in Bad Willbel.
Tens of thousands of Turkish police officers against the government because of "swearing"
In total, 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of the "intention against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrests are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government workers, including four government ministers in last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they reportedly established an organized criminal union and had called telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities of the Islamic Spiritual Fethulla Golden against him and others in power positions.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Schools were opened almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened up to him, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not all over Ukraine peacefully.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, has to fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slawjansk, who visits Jazenyuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign again and that children will receive education that will benefit them in further life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, where the children carry eggs, keep balloons in their hands, and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a glorious spaceship from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she's got her own experience.
Her career began at the world management company Bain and Co., where she changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was the president of the Financial Times for seven years and was back when the top posts of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Your recovery amounted to almost 1 million £.
Her political rank is also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when she sought more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former member of the Tory Council.
In May, I described the position of the President with a broken neck.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: after the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and rest when things go wrong.
This ensures a almost unsustainable double, which requires a complete reform.
But what new presidents will be risking, presenting it, joining in all things, and joining an institution which is as complex as a Chinese Dynasty, while perhaps bringing himself to work.
It's a difficult task.
And if that isn't enough, many still are interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status are overdue.
As competition draws closer and threatens new old, comfortable security technologies, the ongoing processing of licence fees for the BBC is linked to special risks.
For the estimated sum of £145.50 per year, the British public is buying into the world's largest media business.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pounds per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising on the popularity scale again: 53% today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The sight and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I'm getting news messages today on my phone and see changed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loving and considerate institution.
She needs a prominent president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says a dozen tweets were not authorized.
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, included a significant comment on the democratic state of the region, which is in the middle of a criminal complaint against him because of the abuse of the government.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another perry user account, which deleted the previous one.
Gerade has been sent a tweet from my account which was not authorized by me.
"I'm not happy with the tweet and I've deleted it," said it in the later news.
Perry's staff did not respond directly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account were issued, it was not clear who actually deserves the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unprecedented picture of the state of the region was drawn by Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to prison in April 2013.
Perry introduced a Veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return what might be a complaint against Perry - the perhaps presidential candidate - led this month to Austin this month.
The text of the tweet says: "I don't always drink the three-fold permissible alcohol mirror ... but if I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he publishs it."
I'm the most popular Democrat in Texas.
Lehmbergs Bureau was not concerned with the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special government lawyer from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry complains not guilty and announced a political trick.
His high-class team of law-makers called on the judge concerned to dismiss the charges and argued that the law against the highest official in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and reported in cases of state corruption in Texas - refused to return as Lehmberg.
This Veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had finished at the elections in Iowa during his presidential candidacy 2012 as a fifth, Perry announced that he would stop speculation by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at the jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we will come!"
Berkeley explains the housing market again for "normal"
One of London's prominent construction companies pointed out that the housing market in southern England was "back to normal" level.
Owners in the capital were hot, and the property was much more valuable, which led the Bank of England to set up mortgage credits in June due to the widespread fear of a credit sheet.
Tony Pidgley, founder and director of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has been back to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak" and added that it offers a "sustainable scope of action".
The real estate market in London was well established during the breakup, as foreign buyers pressed into the capital.
According to information from the Catasteramt, prices in the city area have been estimated by 18.5 per cent in the last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales in the past year.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, price-valued and student offers rose about a fifth in the last year and ended at the end of April to £423,000.
However, a stronger fund has made real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers in the last few months - some of them have also been cut off by introducing new real estate taxes and political rhetoric to a possible "will tax" before the general elections in May.
London's real estate model Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which hard credit comparisons were made, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and at prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage permit in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is rectified.
Hampings International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 by 3 per cent, on the basis of an already weak domestic price.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has been back for a quarter of a year, according to WA Ellis.
However, the desire to own a property in the capital of Berkeley is a victory, as the fall in the amount for the sale of the term was more than 2.2 billion £.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product in the best places remained stable and as a result, the sales of the term were also stable."
In June the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new properties in the year to the end of April - almost one third more than in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual preliminary results increased by 40 per cent per year to 280 million £, by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion £.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the admissions to Berkeley would be in line with current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate that the annual pre-tax result is £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed on Sunday in London trade at $23,96.
Photos by Jennifer Lawrence by Hacker published on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscar lecture.
Naked photos of the Oscar Presbyterian artist Jennifer Lawrence was published online by a hacker, who claimed to have a "Masterlist" of more than 100 stars.
A representative of the star from the "The Panem tribe" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and cried out to the hacker because of "extreme damage of the privacy."
The authorities were notified and were followed by all those who continued to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were apparently created by a failure in the iCloud online storage system of Apple. The alleged "Masterlist" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of women stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Kate Olsen.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are true, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private area of our house - I hope you are so satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the niccolodeneseries "iCarly" and "Victorious" argues that there are pictures of her hands and second "These images of me are GEFÉLSCHT, people.
But we'll be at the same time the beginnings.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande told the truth of the alleged photos of her.
Except from Howard Jacobson's high-end new novel about love and the letter "J".
They float, so you could best describe it, they slowly roll up like a card that you've got in the rain.
Suddenly a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit short-lived.
And then he shot his hand.
He knew it very well.
He was as stubborn as Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stupidity was a just starting affair, which was promising for a smoothing of the only length of his life, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a quiet, warm beauty with unbridled hair and a flat heart from a village on the Norse island, which was even more relaxing and ugly as a port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an old escort that kept the keverns for her aunts, who had picked up a piece in a warm but paradise hall with the coming name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for many years.
The wheels were light, in the bathrooms were still spins, nozzles had left their tracks on all the windows and believed that they were all there, and the garden was covered with cracks, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a child bear, both dangerous and frightening, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the long list for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailin on the broken bed in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusual warm breakfast. Both had joined in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and touching news, when, at the sight of their broken legs, he remembered him at an old black entertainer who had been forgotten by his father at closed roles in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their false aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so correctly prohibited - simply not played.
It was successfully obsolated, as the word was obsolated.
The general taste, which had never been created, and as the people of books chose the ballads from teller-sum-millionaire-memories, cookbooks and love novels, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Keverns began to play an imaginary piano and put large feet in a grob-commatic serenade Ailins.
Ailinn doesn't understand that.
"It was a famous band of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically placed two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a child.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't very funny right now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone yet.
Jazz became, even though he wasn't banned directly, he didn't play.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was just a place for a single "win" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
Also the mind.
His incomprehensibility made people nervous.
And Jazz was a musically expressive mind.
Although he was 10 years old, without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevin knew something about Jazz from half the secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain that Fats Waller was black.
In her old age, she probably couldn't remember a time when the pop singer wasn't black.
Again, no laws or weaknesses.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society would be grateful to the principle of group tax - thankable as they were removed from the table.
People with afro-caribis origin were suitable for maintenance and sport, so sing and run.
People who were originally born from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and cared for the task to ensure that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish Community was concerned about the canalization; what was left of the Greeks, came to teller.
Those from the Gulf states and the survivors whose grandparents had not left the country as soon as they were concerned about what happened - from fear of fire, even fear that the flames would burn them as the next attack - had opened up Labneh and Shisha Pfefen restaurants, were concerned and depressed with the unemployment.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard balls, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the misleading words that the cowards had just predicted could be seen.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really disturbing," said Kevin.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father hasn't trained anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the late garden gave him the terrible feeling of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the scalding of the huge cooler leaves.
Ailinn still doesn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he tried to put two fingers in her face at the lips again.
She already thought he was something special.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She accidentally shot her head and closed Kevin's eyes.
There was nothing else around the world to see than her untreated red hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she said without any assurance.
But that doesn't explain why you're threatening me.
You seem to be worried.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet aren't that direct.
Maybe your button, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my pants are too thick?
Did he hate you?
Of course I didn't hate you.
But that's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your thick pants are exactly the reason why you hurt me," he tried instead.
I'm a little weird.
That doesn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because he did not have his father like him on the relaxing charm that he needed to bear the gravity in white.
Maybe his father wanted to be nice too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevin, that's it.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and got himself out of her bedroom, the console ran around and broke the wine they had drank.
Holunder flower wine, so drinking was no excuse for him.
In their arrangement, they seemed to sit like palmseeds in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I can't touch you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary incompatibility of his words and the fear shown in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and isolated ocean came here like there on the altar.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and comfortable after DEM WAY WHEN they had been their ancestors as smugglers and beachmen, were always willing to raise their hand against a woman who had abandoned them or been humiliated.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick foot if she hadn't made it up!
She first knutch - knutschen was the most commonly used word for a erotic attraction between men and women, a contrast to the unsatisfying bonds of love from the console - they were the first knuts and then beat.
According to Covern's view, it was an unnecessary refinement, since the knife itself had already represented an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign through his body.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She also felt lonely, but the wait of her grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
But you can't.
She looked at him as he left - like a room in the upper floor with her companion - a man who complained about something he himself had complained about.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and for men in general, even though some of her hands had risen against her.
A man turned away from her, turned back, ashamed, saw, without a struggle spirit - why was that a view they would have known well if they could not remember at one time, where she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailein looked at Solomon's feet.
A few years ago, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent 32-year-old researcher in Offnow's mandate, the non-legislative monitoring body for public opinion, worked on a short speech on the continued violence at low and medium-sized levels in exactly the countries where their reduction would not have been expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "to undermine the aggressiveness of a people who have led thousands of wars and who have won most of them, especially in the distant corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet spirit of human friendship has been seen historically despite the high-questioned churchms among the Hecks rarely.
But some of the properties appear to be uninterrupted.
The higher the church tower, the less the suffering it continues to grow.
When the people hear sensitive balladens, they look forward to stories of overwhelming difficulties and insist on believing in the widows of Heirat and family life, but not only does the former peace not only hold the rural communities as well as our urban refuges stand in hand, but there is also room for creating a new and sustainable route to home, on the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to transfer," she thought when she read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum cut her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Again, Sweigen.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a free place of work.
We serve a privileged society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and worthy of praise, may sometimes obscure the results you have presented them.
You yourself have apparently taken advantage of the church, and these things that you refer to as "containable" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as a expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to travel back, what GESCHEHEN IS, when ES GESCHETEN IS, as if it had happened yesterday, would mean taking the country’s essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Within his head, a LED manuscript in Flamingorosa resumed the councils thatoffnow had distributed to the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Leave her neighbors, value her partner, listen to dances, visit Musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen to, agree, apologize.
Language is better than Swedish, the songd word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand where you want out," answered Esme Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure that her predecessor had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective as we are ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we can find again how we repeat the error which is basically the only one that leads to what is being done.
This time, however, it is not the others to whom we leave our forest and our mysteries.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To make an Englishman patient.
"They go too far," he said, "if you refer to actions as "misleader" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They're going too far if you're talking about that they'd let their "Wat" and their "Misstrauen" go to "other".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind anyone in your position that when we understand the past, such as the protection of the present, we do not speak of "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of order, that's all we know.
"From the one who, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme cautioned, "no part of the society can claim to have a good attitude.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened is happening.
That was it.
There's no need to say anything more - we're a few of them.
And just as no guilt has to be attributed, no guilt has to be added if such an arrangement is appropriate and if there is a way to reach them.
But what will the past do if we do not learn from this?
The past will make us forget them.
If I can tell you something--
Luther Rabinowitz brought his pyramid together.
"I'll meditate on her report," he said, and left her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was taken over by a motor driver who, as passengers described, was on the road in a kind of "brutal wind".
There's accidents.
Lesotho-Military said no state power has been planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho objected to planning a state-run attack on the government and said that they were opposed to police officers who were called upon to engage in the arrest of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane flew out of the country and shared that the country's army had surrounded its headquarters and owned government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Premier brought his family into the adjacent South Africa after reporting of attacks.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that the fact does not give a state authority, but the military reacts to the threat by "political fanatics" whose armed forces are led by the police.
"What happened this morning that the branch of the defense forces of Lesotho responded after receiving several secret reports that within the police there were some elements that actually wanted to attack some of the political, political and political young fanatics, who were just ahead of it," he said against Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monela said that military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed that the government should be subjected to violence, all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho have previously shown signs for a state party," he said.
Speakers of the army of Lesotho told the soldiers on Sunday that they would return to their barracks and be at peace in the capital.
In the meantime, the vice-president Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government leadership during the absence of Taliban.
Thabane explained that he believed that he had become a target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June, after the Taliban Parliamentary sittings have been suspended because of the austere provisions in his government.
He said that his actions had not been intermed with the government, otherwise he had heard accusations against him.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month scale
The increase in production in the euro area was delayed in August at the lowest point in the last 13 months, with a well-known study.
The final market sales manager index of the manufacturing company (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, following a position of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New contracts went back and factories experienced increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place on Thursday before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The banks expect a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the euro area and for the ongoing inflation at a rate of inflation of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the ECB's leader, Mario Draghi, could make further information this week whether it is worth a quantitative simplification for the euro area, in line with those taken by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"While small growth is better than even no growth, the rapid effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at the market.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the highest level in 11 months with 51,4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a concerned child, as well as the Italian descent from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Noting that growth trends in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer alarming," Mr. Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to slow down the fire of analysts waiting for more monetary or fiscal reasons.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief business expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the sales manager index of the production business in the Eurozone since August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Employers in the Eurozone find life very difficult now as current geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase insecurity in the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that some contracts will be delayed or even broken down, in particular major contracts.
He said that it would be "always more likely" that the ECB would finally have to introduce a kind of QE, "even if we suspected this would be limited."
The teenage years of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible destruction of the school, as the children still suffer in it today.
Ten years ago more than 1,000 people from Czech militias were taken to a school in Beslan in southern Russia as hostages.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that the world was shocked.
We are returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who died at the funeral in the classroom.
Just a decade after the last siege of Beslan's school, 334 people, including 186 children, were warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamic terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, arrested and killed, seemed to be the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in abscheu, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the worst land.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who died at the graveyard in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome opposition, even though the memory of these terrorist acts will always be followed.
Your biggest hope?
That the war that now seeks Ukraine - and in the child as they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to get back into the hot school hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she was just trying to get back to her underground school hall after a mine was exploded.
After her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old, was looking for Aida.
They were kept for up to two, but they survived.
"A woman told me I should run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bleeding.
I stood up and leaned back to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she was completely healed, but yesterday she said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I was afraid I'd have to be surgery again.
Some granates are still in my neck.
Your goal is now to become dentists to help people how you have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said.
"That's happened to me, and it can't be changed.
Once a year, I go to the sports hall to remind myself of those who are there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future class cameradin Dzera Gapova was killed there.
We played together when we were young, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, even though the memory is getting weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our tears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and around here.
When I see the photo of me online, how I get back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and contribute to something like this is not happening again.
The young man who flew through the cave hall, in the opinion of his mother, is up to
It was his first day of duty (Russia went to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mama told me I'd hang myself if it was an explosion and hold their hands."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear, they could be up, he flew and saw a wild little child on the way, he caught it by hand and flowed through a bullet hole.
His father, Vladimir, who shut his son out in the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save them."
In fact, Tamara was buried outside and with injuries in the hospital, on the other hand, in the belief that her son was around.
After her reunification, she said: "I was happy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran back and woke me up.
Damir was later fled to London (from the news of the World’s disbanded newspaper) to receive the title of a Barnardo’s Children’s Championship from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow up in my memory.
I still know I'm stealing all my guns right now.
But now I can play computer games with jokes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played in the court with, and they didn't make it out.
We don't say they've been killed or they're dead.
We say they're staying in the sports hall.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially on the game bookings, where I could find out everything I wanted and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends experience.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer under the clouds," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the seizure, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers living on her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London laughed when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her Foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I have helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and invited all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with kellners at a restaurant.Damir had sex with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world has not been better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and still are killed.
They're just like us.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are late or are busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir has grown big and is a very mild and quiet young man, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for rache, for example, he's not superseded by the past.
I know he doesn't like to remember that, but he's got six good friends from the class, and they're going to the sports halls on occasion, and they're going to dance there.
When he was younger, he left it down - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, the face turned off from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he kept all his weapons and other military equipment. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was up and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw the holes around me, with all the body parts lying around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hole.
"I remember saying to him, "Damir, run, run," but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
George Ilyn, 17
The young man whose bad image was taken after the fall to the symbol of the tower of Beslan
Trust: Georgia-Operationist with his mother Fatima after the 2004 edition, a picture of Georgia today
His bloodthirsty face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Czech terrorists shot down his classmates' cameras.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the Barbarian of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had appointed him for his first day of high school before she was fired to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists hit him, and so my little boy stood there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all of it, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia was able to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time here, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me all the time.
No one will forget what I promise you.
Finally: The picture of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking of the attacks and was confirmed as status (right).
I remember that Georgie wanted to go to school this day, he said he wanted his teachers to change.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on the TV.
And now there's even this status of late Georgia in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden from us at home in the bookstore.
I understand that, but I also believe that people all over the world are feeling our pain.
Georgia says today: "It's important that never happen again.
"I doubt we're ever learning the truth.
People are constantly searching for such tragedy and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the disappearance of this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused him?
This world's going to be a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are not even the same pain.
We need thousands of years to forget it a little bit.
It has touched my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some albums due to the seizure, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was worried every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were murdered.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st September draws closer.
I want to kiss my old childhood friends Tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I won't accompany me.
My life is going on.
I finished school this year and visited a medical school in Wladikakkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijow, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught by a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgie Fanijew was arrested during the siege to the feet of a killer terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and next to the bomb that was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it would have been yesterday," says Georgie, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret substance but could not do this because of his health damage due to the seizure.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily go through bad experiences - I have to say that doesn't agree.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and then felt something better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never go back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I've lived in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of herself in the hospital after the bedside on the laptop
My pain is unconscious, and I bring him with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
I'm good physically.
I should be careful with my broken knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's secret service academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I have my notes, also the medical records, and they have answered that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cats".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about it, and they should not suffer it themselves.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain doesn't leave me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws closer.
I'll go to the holidays to think about.
I know Georgie won't get involved.
It's got to be even harder for him because he's there and I'm not.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he has been sent back to me.
It stays in one another.
Georgie is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something's going wrong.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his neck.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he doesn't drive a sport.
I'd say he'd overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only strengthened my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is about the dead.
I know about families in which new children were born, but also about white people who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart leaps in me when I see him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world -- wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can't believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how could we fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more have been killed.
If only we could get all these rebels out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tsakajewa, 10
The baby who was so excited by a special-purpose command
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian specialization command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the gravity
The world was beginning to lose its spirit in 2004 when the baby Aljona was brought into the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar, returned to the school hall.
Makhar, then three years old, came out, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murder camp.
Her father Ruslan has recently remarried and with his new wife, Swetlana has a little girl he named after his lost daughter, Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the situation and is raised to an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
They'll understand why.
Man accused of having girls on foot pass in five
An 78-year-old man stands in front of the court because of the transfer of a three-year-old girl on a footway in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is charged with driving a girl on the move to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The complaint is that Mr. Stewart has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and hurt the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstrother, argues the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC initiated the procedure for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most valuable option is a waterproof point-and-shot shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are both for about 300 dollars.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Depending on the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery bag and other bags are closed close.
Also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorder are available on stage and recording mode, optimising the lighting time for the dry water conditions.
And before you jump in, check how deep your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping cart and the reviews to digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multi-tasks - because many don't get caught.
Point and shoot cameras have a LCD that you can compile images, action cameras are not normally available.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to view this under water, and the correct image setting is a success.
So make a lot of notes.
If your camera has a row mode that allows you to make a series of recordings with easily modified lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, as long as you stay away from the surface.
So if you stay close to the surface if you take a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more colors to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice to the country, but it is even more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed width lens, which means you must keep close to your objects when they are to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving patients both the agony of disease and the quality of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of follow-up.
Lawson knew that the doctors were important for diagnosis and disease, while treatment was mainly involved with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started his path.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that his wife, Juliet, acted impatiently.
"I want everything better now than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very uncomfortable and unreasonably upset.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an examination of his breast.
Just two weeks ago, he was in the French Alps for skiing.
The results of the R & D investigation were expected.
He is a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that causes the chest failure, so that the lungs are affected by excessive skin.
As with most cancers, the exact solution is most difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been former smokers.
But Mesothelium is different.
In almost all cases, the solvent is an asterisk load - contact with the fascist substance, which was once considered a "substances" but was identified as deadly.
For most of us Mesothelium is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbest is a product of the past.
The most dangerous Asbesty type has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily made a commitment not to use it anymore.
Even where he was still used, only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - Klempner, construction workers, roommates and firefighters, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it does not seem to be worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is unsatisfied.
Britain, as it seems, today experience the height of a mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesothelium here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, as many people die in this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma fatalities since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we now experience the deadly effects, although Ashbest has been illegal for years (1999 were prohibited from all types of Asbest), is that a mesothelium developed only after decades.
And the taste of mesothelium is not limited to former workers of the farm.
Asbest was, and is often still in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the businesses in which we buy.
As a result, Mesothelium does not know any class disease, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bass, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not a protection area.
Parliament's buildings are busted.
Even in hospitals where we are to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the source of the disease.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a Klempner either.
It was hard for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with Asbest.
Then find it out.
"It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of ambition."
All - students, nurses, doctors and nurses - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my grandparents will suffer from the same disease?
He was at least partially able to answer this question.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who had mesothelium in the last five years," he wrote in a letter, "I am the last who still lives."
How many of us will still get sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesothelium was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
That was an unusual long life.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomers die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat the question of Lawson: "How many of us are still sick?"
The leading British expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, believes that if the asbestepidaemia in Britain is expected to occur in the United Kingdom, 90,000 of the disease will be the victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the acts of the Court, often used by the victims because of damages needs, shows how far the mystery of Mesotheliom has spread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, offered to have Janice Allen safely exposed to the stress.
She worked for the Kete for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the Flagship Store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she's got two kids in the Zwanzigers.
"For this matter," she says, "I've never heard of Mesothelium, I didn't even know anything about Asbest.
I never thought it would matter to me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about Asbest.
In fact, the concept of Asbest is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name is derived from the word "asbestyform", a description of the phaser structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as the white Asbest, is today the most often found in buildings.
It was used for roof discs, floor discs, wheelings, drillings, even for brakes in cars.
It is less deadly than other asps, however, is considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible consequences of death.
More dangerous, however, is the brown Asbest (Amost) and the blue Asbest (Crokydolith).
Britain was one of the world's largest importers of raw asbest, and experts convinced that "it is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major basis for the uniquely high mesotheliomers."
A staff member from Marks & Spencer was placed in the Flagship Store in Oxford Street, London, Alamy.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliometer, but Julian Peto's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects showing that "a significant proportion of the mesothelium was caused by work or perhaps by an asbest contact in the environment without known exclusion."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks as if no one could be safe from it.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been exposed to the substance.
Goddard reported that service bags and pipelines were contaminated behind Parliament's committees with Ashbest, whose deadly phases could be triggered by something as humourless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems as if the opposite is happening.
While the directive of the Parliamentary Labour Service concluded that the Westminster Palace had received a "saver health certificate" it was undisputed that 1 billion euros had to be spent over several years in order to renew Parliament to modernise the electricity installations and remove the busiest and that after the general elections in 2015, the members would likely be at the next QE2 conference centre rather than at the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of Asbest was not treated in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could not accurately determine the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that during his work in hospitals, he was exposed to the asthma.
"I've worked in a hospital in which the Asbestos were positively chosen," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all places where you worked and the data.
The day of December 2009, when he arrived, he was still well remembered.
He was 45, and he just started an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I was hungry.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the ride home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest failure caused the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to deny a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors have taken his breast and put Pleurakathether in order to take fluid out of the lungs and test it in the lab.
However, his complaints remain undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient was diagnosed with mesothelium with similar symptoms in his practice.
But even now Abbott is not bound by his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades old and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection was clear in that case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition again deteriorated, and his house-to-house brought his CT scans and röntsbacks to an expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after the first time that he was sick, a camera equipped with a sound was introduced into the hole between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I didn't even have so many worries.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "Man told me it was mesothelium."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelium Diagnosis
Suddenly, Abbott had a term with Macmillan's sick sisters, who advised him to take an attorney.
Only now he understands the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that Asbest was very widespread, especially in large public buildings in which rohre was often isolated with Asbest," he says.
The people who were exposed to the Ashbest in these buildings are now sick.
And that's how Mesothelium meets younger people who haven't worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous roses with asbestimulations in hospitals were put below the ground, so patients were probably no longer exposed to the substance.
But many workers who moved from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), came with greater probability in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been alive, but life-threatening doctors may have been at risk.
He'll be removed today too.
Students put their bunker on asbeest mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls because of its fascinating and flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first bust in the classroom.
Over the country, thousands of Chemistry hours, students have set off their bunken burners on asbeestmattes.
On Web pages the theme Asbest is now often discussed in schools.
And that's why innocent objects in our houses have included standard asbests, such as footboards or shoe roofs.
"It's an industrial charge that is contained in most of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that involved a woman was single, the abortion of a garden shoe in the 1970s.
So watch how you cut your garden shoes.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immeasurable.
"It takes a long time to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective shift from a doctor's position to a patient.
As healthy patients before him, he reminds himself of all the information he had to come with.
"It was very hard to take everything up," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long have I been?"
And you gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it."
Mesothelium is particularly domestic, because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breath itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelium are caused by ASBST contact.
Asbest consists of the smallest phases.
When the axbest is lifted and the fascinates are placed, they can be fixed in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbest phasers irradiate the chest failure and may resolve cell mutations.
"The problem is with the boneless asbest phasers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax surgeon who moved to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, which convinces Andrew Lawson that he has been exposed to the asthma, is now ironically a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelium.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to the asthma during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the Asbestnadels reach the lungs, Treasure says, "they will be pressed from the breath process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelium.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, a hot conflict.
Some think she's worth a try.
Triasure's gonna ruin that.
"You can't cut out the chest wound," he says.
That's why you're not here with the meter.
That's why the cancer says "on Chemotherapy is not very good," the "work shows", but not entirely.
"There may be a long-term existence," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelium, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single-man support and consultancy office for victims.
"Hallo, Krebscentrale," he said with joy when he called.
"It was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years ago and was still very active.
Initially, abortion was offered six chemotherapy cycles, which lasted four months and would probably extend his life only within a month.
"I was confused," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson created "the things in a more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage because I didn't have to be persuaded, I just called and got a term," says Graham.
A normal patient should receive a referral and wait for the authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelium cancers to be able to carry out the best available therapy.
However, when these treatments are finally unsuccessful, many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to justice in hopes of ruin.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan von Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that Asbest is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very low load also posed a health risk.
And here the company's independence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally reported their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full-fledged damage" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelium was to return to an asbest contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a speaker from Guy confirmed that "the Asbestos were removed in the area concerned in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbest
In fact, it is a major problem for mesothelium companies who are trying to destroy themselves, to assign the deadly contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the events.
Many of its former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that it is time for them, but certainly not with the complainants.
In response to this year, there were significant new legislation that made it easier for mesothelium-related subjects to complain of damage, even if their former employers were no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of 350 million £ of the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 to show a contact, but no one can complain.
In these cases, the complainants receive 80 per cent of what a court might have been able to speak to them in a normal damage process - about $120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom agents that 350 million £ constitute a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a part of insurance for insurance," he says, indicating that in this sum it is a quarter of what insurance insurance would have to pay if the time had not gone by and mesothelium markets could find the companies and they could normally apologize.
Also, Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, added that the law is "not perfect".
But both penning and Morgan gave it that in view of seven deaths, a fast deal is necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom gesetze in December of last year.
At this point, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
Following their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast with Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-phase therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent with the Long-Lazdunski over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's of course with the most important," says Abbott.
It's always seen in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, it's going to be much worse for you.
Graham Abbott undertook the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
No signs of disease have been shown.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-long.
Again, Abbott took six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumor anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very intense.
They have to think about practical things - about money if I'm no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the ball time settings work.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my daughter that I had a disease that I wouldn't be old.
They reacted differently.
Tamsin is very rare and unsatisfied.
She told her friends about it, and we soon received a lot of calls.
Ellie was back.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to do.
But for mesotheliomers, such conversations are not carried out by hope, not by a trace of hope to survive.
The disease (as is ultimately also for Stephen Jay Gold) is a serious safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelium is not life-threatening.
Body of single-saturated Pharaohs in the Asbestos
Asbestraters used for the strengthening of kitchen ovens and for greater heat resistance.
Plinius of the old describes Asbest.
It was developed a tissue that is not burnable.
I've seen servets from this at festivals in the camps.
The use of modern commercial asbest begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (also money) and fabric.
Important asbeestmines are opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal insulation material for the steam engines and turbines of the industrial revolution.
Global asbest production rises to more than 30,000 tonnes per year.
Statistics of Prudential identify a premature rate of death in those who work with Asbest. These do not receive life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke says that the asbeest particles in the lungs "without any reasonable doubt are the main causes of doubts".
That's the first case of this kind.
Kershaw's employer, Turner Bros Asbestos, has no responsibility.
No damage shall be paid.
During the second world war, intensive ships are built, one of the most deadly operations with the Asbest Contact.
Voluntary index of the industry on imports of blue asbest
A professional court confirms the first successful person claims for damages in Britain due to contacts with Asbest.
Global asbest production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
United Kingdom imports 139,000 tonnes.
A health and safety-sexin in Britain is committed by all companies that work with ambition to trade in licences.
Imports and use of blue and brown steel are legally prohibited in Britain.
Any use of Asbest is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelium gelet is adopted in Britain.
A compensation programme of 350 million £ will be announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, however, white Asbest is still used in many countries of the earth as a valuable commodity.
The world production is about 2 million tonnes per year.
China rejects Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators black revenge
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This process probably protects the long-known protestors in Hong Kong's business area, while activists led the planning and mobilization into the process within a few hours after the discharge.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows Communist leaders to designate all non-pecking candidates in principle.
"This doesn't come unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have joined.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK has returned control over Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people from 2017 to choose the government presidency.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic break, because Hong Kong citizens have a direct right of choice, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership holds the run-up through a closely controlled nomination committee by Beijing.
In addition, only candidates "with love for country and love for Hong Kong" will be allowed after a new clause.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most active protests in Hong Kong have been held for several years.
Following the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial area if Beijing does not allow a genuine general right of choice.
On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Occupy-Central trailers were gathered in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they had been planning protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further details to appear to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers shared that the movement "has taken into account the establishment of the central region only as a last resort, an action that should be taken only if all dialogue opportunities are created and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been created and that the establishment of the central region will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday before the government building, security measures were taken, including police forces and barracides.
The loneliness is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they will soon lose control of their city.
The training of people from the party strengthens competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear grows that Hong Kong values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to break under growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement as they threatened the business - the Hong Kong Lifesader.
"Protests from which they speak could cause great economic damage, even after many are involved and for how long they go away," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has criticized the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fear Hong Kong without control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The state-controlled media in China also reported recently about the democratic activists in Hong Kong rather than subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an informal referendum on elections involving 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closures in the United States is now transferred to universities where Freshmen's performances are offered with private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to provide the first luxurious travel service in Britain for students from today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service had a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who have to choose their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are pleased to ensure this year that the students reach the university with a minimum inflow and a maximum in luxury.
One company speaker said that no new bookings had yet been made since the service had just been introduced, however, added that "Students would book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also claimed that, despite the student fees of $9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and demands very much from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important that you make a great first impression, and with HIV you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as a dropout.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely different from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start this month with the study are exposed to a crisis of living costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants does not hold on to the increasing calculations for the simplest basics of life before they can think of spending thousands of money for as simple as the coming home of students.
Feminists criticize racial demand and police behaviour by Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raise their hands in the air and sing, "Hands high, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the disappearance of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white women.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income equality.
However, as the tensions in the Middle East increased and the country was observed, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers to black women shortly after the beating of August 9th, the personal essays came with titles such as "Thinking to Ferguson by a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism there are many people who are over white and speak of privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so familiar that they have to express it.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not regarded as "female themes" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from around here," said Mitchell.
If I put something about how paints stand in their own country under siege, it's amazing.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sex in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury to separate the subjects clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While women now know the subjects of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors are doing the opposite.
"between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were arrived and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history in order to justify Lynchmord.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's right of choice, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and determined that the struggle for the right of choice could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They have decided to apply for women's right of choice, and the right to vote for black should come later," Hattery said.
If you remember such things, one will be able to understand why colorful women do not trust white women.
We haven't done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it lasted another decade until white women organized against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original petition for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time in which white feminists "fang" played with the problems that black women have had since generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control over such traditional feminist platforms?" asked Mitchell.
feminists of the second generation, who build their careers on the fight against reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a collumnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more Protestants from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a risk to the body - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public questions - will introduce the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although stone stands for a more intersectoral feminism, in the race - as well as sex themes - some of its comments on race theme in America are confused.
Christina Summers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but stonems comments to Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, designed to help vulnerable young black and Spanish men, there was an alarming reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that insists on the foundation of the mainstream feminism.
After nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived at the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a woman's theme.
Andrea Mercado, Co-President of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a review of the topic as a key theme, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of labour visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a clue in women's organizations," she said.
"Schweine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate paintings, as it was shown that it showed a great woman who had made herself comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, is on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - a woman also heard that her head had prayed on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said the woman on the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was published informally and removed between," said one of the company's speakers.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the artist has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The domestic sales provided social media for interest, as some asked whether the wine was in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey hides a new millionaire after Lottoweinn
A Lotto player from Harvey is this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth takes place, with a happy winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper disc in Harvey took the jackpot for the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still needs to report.
The cargo owner Steve Forward said that the profit was concerned about the talk material in the small town in the southwestern part of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is very excited.
We thought such a profit could come in.
Eight WA-winners have celebrated winning in the first Division last month, a rewarding conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
In the past week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had just arrived a few weeks before the megawinn of $7.5 million.
The winner had been playing for twenty years and said that the winner allowed them to buy a world trip and a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA in this year, totalling almost $85 million.
A Leonidas in the Gladiatorium
Not only were the gladiators in the match at the first Rheinbacher Romemer day in the holiday park.
However, the impact of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who faced the rain and the rest of the cold and remained eager for the historic spectacle.
There was a beautiful array of exhibitions, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was no doubt the Martial Battleship of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust battle art in the sand-prepared Arena.
Gladiator owners of "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and professional presenter and sent his men in the ring to the bright twin struggle in various gladiators.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with right-hand shield and short-sighted as well as legs on the left leg and armschien on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breast-feeding, short-sighted and wurfly, as well as its gladiatoral helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "retiarius", which attacked the "Sector" with Wurfnetz, Dreizack and Dolch, and shortly after fighting the burs on the ground.
There the heavy metallics came to power, the paintings were created, and the floorings were flying in surprise by the Arena that a fear and fear of the gladiators could be felt about the health of the gladiators.
But on the imposing "Summa Rudis", the Musculoskeletarian judge, had always had a remarkable eye.
"We wanted to relive the Roman day and experience the culture of the Roman era," explained Lorenz Euskichen, president of the "Freundskreis Romecanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum" was a Roman city, as was established by the Bishop Claus Wehage in his speech.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we still admire today.
The rest of them were also to be present on the day of Rome, about "Aquadukt-Marmor" from the 11th meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridges, which were located at Lüfttelberg.
The Frontinus company put the water and energy supply first and now, and the manager of the company Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of the past."
This is also confirmed by Diploma Vermesting Engineer Ralph Saintiger from the "Ingenieur teamTwo" from Rheinbach, the instruments of measurement of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Romerville in Blancenheim presented skis and models of the excavating anno 1894 as well as steel stones from the original Hypokaste, the warm air theater which first heated the Romerville.
It is also impressive that the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago were left in the tunnels before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland Landsverland had destroyed the rest of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
It has been found inside the walls of an economic building with a door for drying grass and for mulberry.
The building must have belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of pieces of background from these decorations were presented in a glass-vitrine, including a large counter, several fine glass plates, and parts of a steel chain.
The villa may have existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the fall of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser.
In her day, the children also worked with the Roman windmill game, like today's ball game, or they wrote their names with metal taps on tables.
At the position of the Romans, Zülpich, the children were forced to lay down the Mosaics themselves, build the Rheinbach Glasmosiken, and serve at the centre of nature Eiffel Nettersheim, a heavy weasel from stone to paint the honey for a flat break or a mousli.
With the original-made Roman passenger cars taken by two Kalt flowerers, the visitors went through the holiday park and came to the impressive state of the city Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the village of Wachtberg will also be included in the year 2014 in which it is to commemorate the death of Kaiser August 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat and History Unions, as well as the Wattberg Wander-Verein, the Partnerships and the Oberbachem League, are offered, including thematic journeys, a lecture, cooks, and guides for school classes and remind of the Roman past of the Oberbachem.
For example, a Roman legionary will be told about his work on the adjacent wall, presented plants as living memories from the time of Rome, and presented a significant teaching hour in matters of international understanding between a group of guards "Germans" and those brought to Rome.
The Adendorfer Basic School is devoted to the Roma theme within a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer should be made more experienced on the first visible trails of the Romans in Wachtberg.
A small presentation at the foundation of the Berkum Maternal Secretariat will be remembered in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemiology Deploys West Africa Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious threat to the economy.
Markets are confused - and international companies go far.
The dominant Ebola epidemic is the West African economy.
The heritage falls on the fields which have been left behind and the markets are destroyed - the virus has seriously affected the region.
Some international companies are already on the move.
"Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only on the market will anyone who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the worst hit by the virus, only here the fever falls more than 600 people to the victim.
In recent years, health authorities have stated that the disease has been promoted in every corner of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have spread the virus.
In total, more than 1,500 people have died, thousands more have joined them.
Foreign companies attract employees
Overarchingly in the resource-rich countries, companies take over their business.
Foreign companies such as steel companies Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the regions concerned.
The domestic dealers and farmers also react: only a few people have left their homes to provide shelter.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are below Quarantane, the main coffee and coffee trees in the fields, among other things, were broken down.
The farmers didn't drive it to leave their home for the farmers.
Food becomes scarce
"People will travel ever less," says Phillip De Vreyer, Paris expert on the West African economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his company, is more likely to stay at home.
The population is therefore able to overcome the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the advantage of basic food products such as rice is lacking.
At the same time, the region, which depends heavily on international companies, has an image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies are mainly in the area over a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial to determine how far and how long the virus will extend.
In the case of investors, the impression could be "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," warns Hugo.
The disease also imposes the State's strapsed state-owned holdings
The disease also imposes the unstrapised state-owned holdings of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely fragmented from the high expenditure for the health system and in addition from the corrupt economy.
The African Development Bank has already agreed to assist the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are also fragile in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the vast region of the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
In other places, however, many people are already afraid of being housebound.
Also bookings in hotels go back clearly.
Protect your 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Bergau protects it from 12 to 14 September and celebrates its 50th anniversary.
The preparations for the 50th anniversary of the September 12th to 14th are under way at the summit of the Tannenwald Reserve.
It is planned on Friday, 12 September, a large entertainment company with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, about 18 o'clock, the big bowler shop.
Next is the large fixed seat of the voter with the "stairfäzer spitzbum".
Blaskeelle ensures the music
On Sunday's summits are the Festival Service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large festival at 14 a.m.
The next day is also the price distribution of the Bundes and Gaussichhenen.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 fetish ladies with their diners.
Fest capelle is the Blasachelle Berngau.
The government has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original term "Schutzensensschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from 1907, when the Union was founded on 21 March on "social entertainment through living in rooms and small-scale skies".
The NS regime had demanded the resolution of the Union in 1937.
Only in 1964 were 19 young men again found who took the "new" shield "tannenwald" Berngau from the grave on April 30, in the Gasthaus Lukas.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the Union as a protector through a difficult time in which it was primarily going to find a union location and install the ship business.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the guard room in the Gasthaus "Leinger" began fighting with two men.
In the years following, the sport protections, which were organized in seven men, were established in all classes up to 1 August.
The united record cleaned every year and the magic border of 380 Ringings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active protection has increased, the membership figures have also developed positively.
After the merger "Leingerer" has no longer met the demands of a modern protection union, the then board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future domigl in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Heart".
After working 2700 hours, Pfarer streeter gave the church victory on 8 May 1988 for the new protection rooms.
One of the major points in the history of the United Nations was certainly the 44th guise, linked to the fair way of the new defendies in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the defendant celebrated his 30-year-old birth certificate.
1995 was founded by a Group of Böllers.
Josef Schmalzl was referred to as Böller.
A major challenge for the "Bullers" and for the Union as a whole was the launch of the Bayern Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of unifying work, the members of the Union have modernized the rooms and the storage facilities in the Berngauer Court and thus brought to the latest state of technology.
Elf teams in round-up combat
You can also see the sports services of the protection unit.
In total, eleven men are currently involved in the round-up battle: six air threat men, one aircraft gun man, one sport gun KK1, one young and two AH men.
The 1st mansion with Lars Elrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann is set up in the area around 2013/14 by the Gauobergliga (the highest League in the ARB protection case).
The 2nd mansion with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml were set up from the Gauglia North.
In addition to the skiing sport, events such as basketball, skiing and royal ball, adjoining flight and Christmas party tradition.
With this, the protection is also at the festivals in Pfarrei and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the race route ended about half the way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart was second against the wall, after his right front row in round 172 and ended up at night.
Stewart was in the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-capital team was disappointed, but now focus on the race on the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better outcome for him," said Johnston.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart had already been running on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I am now with right hope of a good outcome," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't regret it."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the locker and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart let three NASCAR Sprint Cup race off after his car hit and killed another driver at a train race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr.., which was during a race on the train to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that the investigations due to the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
There was no decision on whether Stewart had to count on a complaint.
The dramatic champion was received with great surprise when he was presented before the race.
After a start at position 12, Stewart was already in the first 10 claims and was currently on the square.
After a refurbishment in round 122, busted
Vehicles with No 18 out of control after the exit from Curve 2 and collated with Stewart, both of whom were driving against the wall.
Stewart went on, but he went back to place 21.
Searches for dancers
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Betina, Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel (left) are happy with metrics.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in TV Jan of the entire day-long education are also able to create the continuing schools.
After summer vacations, some groups have been severely decimated.
Now it will strengthen growth sought for a kind of sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In both the jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance format "Spirits", only nine children are still.
"Three in the age of eight to twelve, six in the age of twelve to 15," says the 20-year-old.
With more activists, the whole would make a lot more fun, "you could dance all other choreographies," she says.
Those who have fun at dances can spend between 17 and 18 hours on Thursdays or on holidays between 17 and 18.30 in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, unboundly during the training hours.
"The training starts regularly with a heating program," says the trainer.
Then various choreographys are introduced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no established form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from folklore over classic to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, the company is not too short.
"We're going to eat sometimes, watch dance movies and we've even spent the night in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful Hobby and do a lot more for your own motor development.
Whoever Jazztanz is not like that, he can also break into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always be taught in children's dance/jazztanz, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop in the teacher's teaching.
The dancer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance beds on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who have fun on discofox, long-range walzer, Wiener walzer, Rumba, Cha-cha-Cha and Tango have a chance to get ahead and do it together.
Bulgarian prison guards protest throughout the country
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands after restoring their old working conditions that were recently changed.
There are also higher cases on a list of demands to be discussed with the Minister of Internal Justice Christo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting for a month symbolically against the new working hours and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continued with the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, to the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade union Association of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Ukrainian Army has aired Luhansk Airport
In Austria, the Persian fighters are still on the front line.
After heavy fighting, which apparently also involved Russian panzerballoons, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, set up the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army shared that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroschenko had already taken personal consequences from the heavy downset of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the highest conduct of the army without detail.
Prorussian separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-russian separatists have re-examined a fighter and two military bombers.
In addition, about 100 soldiers had been injured or killed in wars in the Donzk region, and the rebels shared with Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Ships Reduced
The opposition also insisted that two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard be lowered first in the Asowsche Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been caught on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
When seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the sender 112.aaa.
Two members were considered missing.
Other media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists reported that several municipalities in the Donzk area had been under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the city of Minsk, the Ukrainian Contact Group is currently in contact with the Russian capital.
In addition to the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a envoy of the separatists from Austria should participate.
In the meantime, all actors used their skills to make public recognition of their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia because of the Ukraine crisis in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels, NATO held its founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a serious breach" of the agreement.
"Today we must see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and opinions of the Russian side, "that they consider us to be enemies".
Strong NATO presence
Rasmussen also announced that he would like to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A NATO summit in Wales to conclude "Readiness Action Plan" will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east, as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiew and Moscow some on new gas conversations
Russia and Ukraine have subsequently agreed on official data in new languages to address their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for the next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It will still be expected to make a decision by the European Union whether it will also agree with a representative to the talks.
As a result of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has been unable to obtain any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also undermine gas supply for Europe.
Europe has a third of its land gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Markel talks Answer: but will come "ganz clear"
Now the Chancellor's face is clear.
But it's not a book for all complicated details.
Heartbreaking thoughts from the CDU against the Pkw-Maut have greatly grown the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after enduring opposition from her CDU, spoke out a challenge for the introduction of a Pkw-Maut.
"To be clear: she's in the coalition contract, and she's coming," said the party chief on Monday after the meetings of the CDU spitzengremia in Berlin.
In a detailed model, the brand was not first fixed.
In the Black-Royal government programme, there are "defined parameters".
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobindt (CSU) has "has made a proposal and is now continuing to work on it".
The NRW CDU, however, needs to be at its core at a rate equal to all roads.
Markel stressed, too, that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is constructively involved in the discussions on a draft law.
In addition, he spoke with Dobindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including in broadband development.
"There's not a special thing about it." Schüble had left a "spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday to check his house a own concept in order to benefit car investors with interest - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chief Horst Seahofer warned of the development in the Cabinet of Mautkoncepts against the federal minister.
The CDU Bundesvise Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never went out of its way to combat all cross-border and federal streets," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU-country president.
Otherwise, it would be an important signal that Seahofer has now announced once again to talk about the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Pafalz.
The background is fears that a wall will affect the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seahofer had demanded a series of CDU coalition bands due to the wall criticism.
The left views the plans in the view of the Union as broken down.
"The Murks Maut is dead," said Dr. Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the Wall, the Minister is separated." Dobindt wants to introduce a Vignet's obligation to all German streets to start in 2016.
Inland car owners may, however, be subject to a coalition contract.
Therefore, they should receive a full balance for the wall over the Kfz control.
However, the model cannot be shared by foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic impairment often misdiagnosed
One Britin says she thought that she would die as a result of a lack of diagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her young in the faith that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, it belongs to the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and backmark.
Charity CMT UK reported that missing diagnosiss are a common problem in people with CMT because it is so little known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and damaged lines.
Patients also suffer from feelings of mortality or pain. The disease is unhealthy and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from a heart attack (FA) - a disease with very bad survival chances.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, now 51 years of age, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time, and everything was longer with me.
I was never able to ride with the other children Rollschuh or Skateboard and was often taken to school because of my nature.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her achilles vision and to cut her foot of her illness when her doctor left the room and read that she was on the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I never told anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FAO society," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and frightened in panic.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and in the meantime, I would soon lose all my skills.
I did it all alone with me and planted my own preparation.
She said, when she turned 17, she became clear that her abilities had not been as strong as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and smiled at me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you've got something much less life threatening.
Following some genetic tests, it was established in its CMT.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT warning month to pay attention to this disease.
A. D. Berni Dieter has been working since the end of the former assembly site as a fireman
For almost ten years, no more shots will be shot at the former rupture site in Munich.
Nevertheless, every month the deadly munitions in the heart of the biospheric region still appear on the Swiss album.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be split in front of the place.
An inexhaustible knife is held in the spinal cord of the biospheric area.
In December 2004, the last sharp board was held at the Münsingen Camp, which was closed after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares of a large area has been the core of the Swiss Alb, which has been opened on 13 designated routes for travelers and travelers.
Tax burden of business people in Washington is increasing with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rates for companies in the country rise slightly in the past year, while economic recovery accelerated, a new published study last week, and the companies in Washington space did not make an exception.
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia totaled $27,6 billion to state and local positions in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent compared to 2012 revenue of $26,6 billion.
The company's state and local tax burden increased by 4.3 per cent in the last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth following the previous several years of the late 2014 and 2010.
State taxes are higher than local charges, by 4.3 per cent, so the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the State Control Centre was conducted by a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 per cent, are from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's revenues are from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenues from companies by 28 per cent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery of the company's real estate value, says researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of this profit came from large countries such as California, New York, and Texas, the run seems to be going to reach the Washington space.
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes in the past year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in one year by 4.2 per cent.
However, the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing State and local tax revenues as the real estate taxes are running on almost more than one fifth of the tax exemptions of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to leave much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The most recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
Companies' records also appear to be obtained, such as the data.
Companies in the region reported revenue taxes for state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in company income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
As the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase at all three places equally.
The rate of growth in the district rose by 4.3 per cent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher by 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax income of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three official areas of the company's minimum income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is 9,975 per cent relatively high.
A comparable study of the U.S. Hand Room in early this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better tax climate prevails all over Maryland.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by her southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent in the coming year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate by 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses seem to go better in Washington space, and they pay more State and local taxes, such as the latest study.
Enterprise taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure, which is organized by most small companies - in the district, Maryland and Virginia in the last year, rise by 20 per cent to $2.4 billion, a significant rate of growth than the corporate taxes in the past year.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to be maintained this year, with an increase in the overall VAT rates for the state and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be reimbursed if the Federal Government's spending cuts on the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopen and Malz - also a popular combination in China.
Germany's beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt partner city in China now wants a bridge and also hopes for a direct link between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, used in Frankfurt partner city Guangzhou - so expresses the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to be left in our city," said the vice-president of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city this week.
Again and again, the executive of the ruling Communist Party of China came back during the conversation on this occasion of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, was one of China's richest cities, Li.
Therefore, people also have the power to buy themselves German beer.
The Hessian SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would join a possible partner in Germany for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, cereals and food," he added during lunch with the party workers in Guangzhou.
This pleasure of life has already come out of Mr. Li, he has made the host.
On the other hand, the Guangzhou staff stopped with a schäfer-gumbel, however with red wine, which was served for food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German culture.
Tsingtao beer is used after the German cleaning offer.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese guest would be a direct link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Chief Li.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 it was economically justified.
"It would be rewarded again," said the Communist politician.
"The business between our two cities continues to grow."
Meanwhile, visitors had to take the road over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight link.
The vice-president of the province, Chen Yunxian, made this wish in his conversation with the social Democrats in the background.
"This is a very good idea," replied the Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German, did not agree.
Partnership established
The fake visa party of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office this year only after his predecessor was transferred from the office because of corruption.
The local leader Wan Qinglian had to go too.
The action against officials from Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration carried out by Head of State Xi Jinping with courage.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his partner, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before his visit to Guangzhou, he worked as a top-functionian in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away from Guangzhou belongs to those on both sides, i.e. with a school exchange.
In the past year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
The South Chinese Metropole at the Perfluss is as strong as all hens with its economic power.
In the next year they wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers "presses the ladies"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has shown hope today that the 81-year-old comerier will recover from her illness.
"Thanks for your enduring love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We're all pushing the ladies.
Her mother was subsequently transferred to the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in Mount Sinai Hospital after a heart attack.
The doctors keep them deliberately seated and under careful observation until they are satisfied with their condition, which will continue to be described as "first".
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly dust cleaners and rising wages
For cars and dust cleaners coming from today's market, future environmental standards apply.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be obtained from 1 September on a label on which the buyer can recognize the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, the "Euro 6" category of waste shall apply to hard-temperature stikoxide values.
In addition, there is more money for the equipment manufacturers: they will receive a total minimum wage of €10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed what information he had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a number of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($990 million).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a transfer from Twitch, but because it was strongly suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it appeared as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billions of things was decided, and cooperation was also natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravos pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", such a insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre, in which the best-known player (most older) plays a passion for memory science theatres, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is also so that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news was that YouTube was about to buy Twitch, to take a long time ago, an example of a established technical company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a clue why the deal with YouTube did not come because the company was ready to report, as well as to pay a lot like Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to run sports than to see it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from seeing others in the games rather than taking control consoles into hand.
It's a thing to look at a friend about 3 o'clock in the morning while she's ill by resident Evil, and something else to look at a spinner like he's shot 20 times in Call of Duty in the head.
All these games could be seen right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the vision without self-control of the perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.
I suggest that the fast transitions in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete all games in record time are sustainable.
But as long as it's not a game or humorvirtuosis, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do you know about the sceptics I've been through?
Twitch is invited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will be so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could easily have shut down.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be recruited as lawyers.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of the game," and the media does not show signs of a storm, nor does it - luck - as a sighting sport.
On Hüpfburg, at the Burggartenfest, there was some looseness on the Sonnabend.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite the powerful regime on Saturday afternoon, 1200 musical fans came to the open air festival in Burggarten.
The entrance had to be stopped for a while.
"That was horrible," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salszedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in Salzdell Burggarten is to emit light through various shows on the day and night.
Well, and the fun comes from alone as well.
This was already shown in the early Sonnabend when the first visitors arrived at the open air.
A party for all generations had promised the organizers.
And that's how they got it.
Around the supply conditions on the Burggardenweise there was Salzdeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings enjoyed it.
They followed the first live performances, muffled with the foot in the cup, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and fun were said.
And that's what's going on through the generations.
While the white sand on the extra-carted sand on the beach bar, others slept on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the baby died on the hill, which was a great sight for the smaller guests.
But also in the children's kitchen, the volunteers had to do with all their hands in the true sense of the word to become the same Lord and to buy fantastic creations into the small faces.
The sizes used the kickertics or participated in a Skateboard workshop designed by the Goodfoot Crew from Salszedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 a.m., he spoke to the visitors, especially the families, looking for the width and the dryness.
But the attractiveness of the party did not break.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "follow-up on the whole line."
That is why a repetition of the great party is not opposed in the coming year.
Despite the content and size of the event, Sam made it clear in a first balance on Sunday against the people's vote.
As a shame, he mentioned that during the time of the entrance, he had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm was booked with very little strength.
The consequences: Some who had already paid no more came to the country.
The resonance was very good.
In a first expected estimate, Salzedel co-organizer spoke with about 1200 visitors who were in the Burggarte.
There was a problem with Tottechnik.
The Salzdeler Hip-Hop Band Blocks`n`Rox therefore detached their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-sound sound.
The planned Shisha holes could not be built because the cells could not be brought to Salszedel because of a rainpan.
"But in the next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The prize of the Amula open air was more than won by the number of visitors.
And that's bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that are still to be made for the first time but must be eliminated at the second stage.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to hide criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"I'm sorry you've taken a little too," Ele Zimmermann says at the same place.
Others see the initial problems not so serious.
I think it's very good that some not only stupid cats but also really try to put something on their legs.
Shut up!", wrote Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizers remain a year's time to dismiss these criticism points.
New Radum in Berkum: Waiting for signs to be printed
He is not expected to be.
More is waiting for the available component to be used in the marked construction work.
The action is in the context of a greater measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA World Observation Council, the Hill, the so-called Council, will be completely renewed.
The new radius will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new hole is the cape exchange
The upper quarter of the old hole is cut off and taken with a skin.
Then the last quarter of the new hills will be set up.
If the weather is playing, the action should start this week over the stage.
A participant in the Ice Bucket-Challenge joins Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried so much when her iced water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket-Challenge went down painfully.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she had been so drunk at the Ice Bucket Calle, that she had cut herself out of the cage.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain crossed so much when her iced water was poured over her head that she damaged her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and as long as I did, my cook just stood up," she said against The Mirror.
Ewasser is being shot over the 20s.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't go, the chef was upset, and then I realized that something didn't agree.
My mother and my sister saw that too and did almost in front of the lake, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-olds from Britain were sent to the hospital to re-enter the cemetery after taking part in the official trend on the day of service.
The Clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do you see the bourgeoisies soon again on a beach?
In the past, there was always a dispute between the two Wolffragsheau Burgvereins.
Now the Presidents are thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolffragshaus Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolffragshaus Burg friends, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, no good climate prevailed between the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie Volfrachhausen.
Speakings vary from place to place, such as the history of the Wolffragshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talk about a common process should be held soon.
This is confirmed by the United President Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) at the request of our newspaper.
"I have called Mr Piffl and proposed that we be able to assemble ourselves once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the Union could again turn to a strike in the future.
This would be faster to record visible results.
While the bourgeois friends around the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until the last time had a reconstruction of the borough at Bergald, the "conclusion and recovery" of the country was the first place for the Burgverein in Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the bourgeois company, was very pleased with his own comments on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, the mayor's friends have been here.
A new president is to be found in a Membership meeting in mid-September.
The Union is currently numbering about 40 members over the 74 years.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have begun to relax the activities of respect." This "denk phase" was necessary to "response how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president should then go to the city council.
Until then, the bourgeois friends could also make a current vote within their group.
A candidate for the Presidency is not yet available, says Piffl.
"But I'm sure someone will find himself." He doesn't want to apply himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president is supposed to be a Wolffragshauscher.
The speaker wants to "but very much to continue working" on the project.
The different positions in matters will be restructured in the eyes of Piffls, perhaps in the near future.
He deserves Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the city.
Two similar, far-reaching projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the people and by volunteers from all over the world, they were a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "And I was skeptical at first.
But in time I have become more and more convinced that it is worthwhile to advance the project. It could create a "all-setting mark" for the river city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financially financed by EU exchanges, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of the reconstruction is that I want to do it myself, so I don't want to do it on board." He hopes that the bourgeoisie may move something at this point.
Their goal to document history first, "is important and good".
Then you could continue to look.
Clavere Road to Save in Uni Teachers
As the cost of Uni-Teachers for many students is greater than $1,000 per year, the fast-second-term student Matt Schroeder turned out to be a smarter split.
He found a rental system for books from higher students and offered a nominal discount to discourage the sale of return.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He gave out $120.
The college team shared that the students spent more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and study materials, however, that there were different cost-intensive options for the students.
Online towns and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution to the student's choice.
The rent of Teachers is more popular, and thus students can use a book a semester long, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university books, shared that the rent of textile books has doubled since 2011.
Questions in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the College books were rented in the last spring, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased according to the Trade Union National Association of College Stores in Campus Booklets.
Here's the only time for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books are available online only a third of the price they have to have in the Campus Bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler costs nearly $290, but can be related to the specialized textbook dealer Chegg.com for 239.99.
Buy Used
If one does not make notes of other or normal use trails, books are a good option.
"Calculus" is required to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says he has issued 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold again for $48.
Academic like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at the Amherst College Without Walls, recommends students to ask their professors whether prior expenses are eligible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminars are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs of the latest expenditure.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to books used.
Notes
The rent of Teachers is worth a transfer if you treat them well in some way, think of giving them back and do not want to keep the books after the course ends.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book purchased.
For example, a student could buy "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about 20 dollars.
Please inform yourself about the terms of the business where you hire, including the penalty charges, which are applicable to writing notes, subsidisations or use marks.
Adjusted: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg, you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers, since many classics can today be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at each other's case.
Joe Gaut, 29, who is first visited by the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check if the book is really ready.
This lesson taught him on the heart tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college library.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a boxer
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" played only $12 million his budget of $70 million.
The "Sex Tape" film on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million in the opening week, while children's films such as "Drinking made easy 2" were also featured at the reception.
An article by the Telegraph Film Criticist Robbie Collin points out that it could be the cause of the child's lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin referred to 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Dryenzem made easy 2" as pure "functional" Fantasy deposition.
However, in films for an older target group, it seems as if the quality of the film is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and the 20th July 2013 and in the current year at least 2000 Leindungs.
The results are based on the opinion of cinematographic visitors and film critics and indicate that this year’s film hits are equal to those in the past year.
Some commentators believe that the development of changing sights and the growing popularity of web streaming services as netflix is to be brought back.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's newly appeared Dschungelbuch film, said against the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times change."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently produced sales of the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost doubles as much as in the previous year, with the turnover of $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on films of Comics and predicting a "carriage" Hollywood.
In the light of the current discharge, some commentators argue that his diminutive prophecy could contain a true core.
Due to the potential boxer expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporters: "The next summer will be the largest summer in the Kinokasse, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd class of the district was put in place for the punishment of the lien integration, that was a step in the right direction.
The German Tischennisbund has now adopted an additional 3rd German version of the programme.
The consequence is that whoever is not baptized shall be blind.
So Göttingen's top class team Torpedo in the Oberligiga Relegation has avoided the decline, however, only five classes will play in the coming season.
The four-class Torpedo women remain in the region despite their great triumphal marches.
The boys and girls of Torpedo begin in the Lower Saxony, as well as the boys of the SC Wende.
The SG Langlers and the Torpedo Reserves take place in the new league, in the country's league no longer represent any Godtinger clubs.
At the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the league, the Torpedo-Sweet in the country.
What from the composition looks like a better class of districts is now the new southern region.
Here are TSV Seoulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Longholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the area, they play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Wende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-Weß, Bovender SV II and TTV Geismar II and III teams. The area of women begins in solar power.
Guests, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen are running in the area.
With your nine men
The SC Wende sends his girls into the small neighborhood.
Also, the district-wide staff of the SCW-boys - there is still torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Wende and the Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two gods circled around with your nine men.
In the West stage are the Red White II, Bovender SV III, Lubuch II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Longlern II.
In the east, there are also satenhausen/Wöllmarhausen, Nikolausberg and Landofshausen.
The queen-Kreisliga consists of satenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Heavens, Seulingen II, Tuspo Wende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle, where there are no more women teams on circuit level.
Assuming that none of the six 2nd-class solar poweres will reach, the innovative and varied circuit board will have to think once again.
Nato summit: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protestors from the Nato-Gipfelds in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to be an anti-Nato marsch.
On Sunday about 150 people came together in Cardiff before the city hall to stop a so-called attack.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments on the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who have moved from Bridgend to Belgium.
Artist escaped from the Blue Mountains
Two young bus drivers were safely brought to safety with the sailboat after they were caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man recently arrived at their tour in Govets Leap.
Protected relatives called the police about 20 hours after they were both not back home.
A search call from local police and rescue services took place and the couple was found about 23 hours near the Bridal Vel Waterfall.
The girl had hurt herself in the neck, and the man was beaten and his head was raised.
The rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they were evacuated tomorrow morning.
They were placed in a stable condition with a medical car in the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Escalate governmental enemy protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half an hour, the sender resumed the extraction.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that demonstrators who had stolen pieces had damaged devices in the editing process.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators demand the return of the Head of State to which they submit elections.
The police reported that about a mile away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it was again on Monday to meet some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
After hospitalization, a police officer was attacked.
On the weekend at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured, as demonstrators tried to promote Sharifs' residence.
They call for the return of the Prime Minister.
After a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict, "no time to waste and use no violence".
The report further stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the State."
Escalating violence has caused concern before a military invasion, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests launched by opposition politicians Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif's giving up a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called their allies on Sunday to quit.
"We won't go back without Sharif forced to return," said Khan.
Qadri went out the same way.
Khan asks Sharif to win the parliamentary election in May last year.
Qadri demands the return of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and launch innovations.
More than 40,000 security forces are used to protect the government's territory.
The demonstrators had at first appealed peacefully to the Parliament until Khan and Qadri woke them up on the weekend to move to Sharif's residence.
Hüteldorfer after the second season on the table three.
With 2:0 over Gradig, she took a bit more a week for Rapid on Sunday.
"The victory is very friendly," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level with the outside of Europe's League on Thursday.
"The success was immeasurably important," confirmed the captain and the attorney Stephen Hofmann, who presented the Green-West on three occasions.
Schrammel-Trumtor brings Rapid to victory Street Rapid with the second season, the correct reaction to the tension against Helsinki and goes with a success experience in the country's game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who placed the candles on victory with his magnificent driving volleyy from the sixteenth floor in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd clean up the whole fruit from Thursday and cut it down under the bed," said the 26-year-old.
As a strike on November 13, 2010, last time in a federal party, it was still for Ried.
The first master in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, it's something very special, I'm from the rapid growth," said Schrammel.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term beak-blessing, he turned his back from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position as well.
He has earned the tower, he's already read some assistants," praised Barisic.
Men show character Scrammel also delivered the flag to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally led to the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have also been able to sign.
"Thank God we've had some happiness today," he also noticed a noise that was playing on the performance and results in the past few weeks: "The results have not been voted, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that you had been "in many games before today" - against "the strongest man who played in this season".
The first three points since July 26th, therefore, have proved that the human race has been in touch with the backlogs to the face: "Today my man has shown that he has a character."
It is not less pleasing to him: "That we've finally played too zero."
Many work during the country's game break Also the situation with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are to be blamed for several cases, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up prizes, making the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget it," Barisic, who lost in the last three days with fear and Pavelic Player, said, "who were very stable in the last few days."
Therefore, the country's game break must be used to "suckle the wind and put a bit in the body area," Barisic, who has five U21 outlaws in his ranks.
One who is likely to be particularly on vacation is Captain Hofmann.
He complains about humanity, it's about pain.
Well, in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his conversion in 68. Minutes not only the structure, but also the second tower.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't think it's all right now" "We've certainly had a little luck, but sometimes the happiness has to come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He was free to work on concentrated follow-up: "I can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad as it has been shown in recent weeks.
But we can't even believe it's all right now.
The importance of his role for the team could not be overemphasized.
But it's a very young man that I can help very much at the moment.
They stayed at certain stages, but I did," said Hofmann.
Grand Coach Michael Baur had little to do with his husband.
He questioned the quick opposition "from the category of Zaubertor", as well as the regular tower of benefits in the 40 minutes, which was announced by counseling colleague to the wrong.
The only thing I can do to the man is that in some stages we were not exactly enough.
There are too few conclusions.
In defense of Maximilian Carner, it was similar: "It's just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a door.
There would have been more in the big and big ones.
Under this Wipple, peace reigns
A powerful tribe we showed during our summer tour of the summer series "My piece from the Rhöner Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the countryside, the illustrated example is the "sudden" over the subwhite bridge.
A narrow footway leads up to about 600 years of age.
There are groups, basalt stone and basalt stone.
A piece below the stone bridge from Bauersberg, a mile north of the road to Weisbach, where it stands.
Vitals look at the natural landscape, it smells above the other trees of the environment and remembers with a range of over eight meters to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intense research, however, there was only reference to the real estate.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheimer archive and interviewed older people from subwhite brunt to learn what connection it has with the hierarchical.
The result of his research remained the right next statement for the names.
At the same time, until about 80 years ago, the tigers were supposed to have sent their animals from subwhite bronch to the most dangerous and free wies.
At the foot of the tree, the animal shelters created by the rise should have been removed.
In the meantime, the area has gained its importance back, because on the shows it is not really going to win again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosafety reserve, Schneider has found further.
However, in the presence of stone formations, caution should be exercised, as the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for crossstones.
A road leads from underground springs to the tree, but it is hidden.
Further ways are explained to increase the direction of the hill and invite to a extensive journey.
Where's the vasserburg?
However, a watersburg, which is sought for at our next task, is to find more rarely in the height.
The storage in the grave already has a good impression of the construction work, but we have some historical buildings in the countryside that could fit the construction counter.
Where's our "Studdle of the Rhöner Happiness"?
My piece Rhöner's happiness
As in previous series of Main Posts in previous years, there will also be another price to win if they have the right solution.
Anyone who wants to photograph himself can also share it.
Under the e-mail address red.newstadt@mainpost.de, you can send us the solution as well as your very personal "Stuck of the Rhöner Happiness" under this heading.
The most beautiful photos will be published.
After a week of accession, Italy's Prime Minister and EU officials, Matteo Renzi, have carried out the appointment of British Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy last week.
Renzi considers how the government’s recent newspaper La Repubblica reiterates that the profession of Mogherini, also in the government’s field as a favorite, is to strengthen the position of social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects an appeal for his "reform package" in Italy.
Finally, Renzi hopes that the left-wing party base will always be peaceful against him again, because Mogherini will be assigned this – even more in a reasonable way.
With regard to the conservative representatives with the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland Donald Tusk nominated as President of the Council, the previous opinion will be made in Rome in order to create a political balance.
Because the EU's Chief Diplomatate will be a representative of the President of the Commission of Juncker at the same time.
The EU Parliament's continued approval is as secure as possible.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have referred to the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica expands Optimism that it has been guaranteed for almost two decades in leading partners and that Mogherini, known for her honour, will show rise to the "great challenges".
The burning Roman is married and has two daughters.
Their participants started the promoted policy of 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di Sinistra (Link Democrats), which in 2008 joined the Catholic Central Party of Margherita to today's social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini was the vice president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election in the Party of the Left Democrats, she joined the high party policy, working in the Foreign Policy Division, whose leadership soon became her leader.
The traditional issues of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, were identified by studies on NATO integration in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troops quota, and the contacts with the social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the House of Representatives, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a Premier in February 2014 he informed Mogherini of his appointment to his foreign minister.
If today's PD has a better relationship with the strong movement of peace in the country, which has contributed more than 40 per cent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in the PD crises, Federica Mogherini.
The developments in Brussels, which the new EU external authority has had too little diplomatic experience, are therefore lacking in substance, will be discussed in the PD.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic members, the Mogherins are followed by metroly realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine, and is defamated as a "Russia friendly course".
It commends the Pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gastrom, which is supposed to be transported directly to southern Europe by the Russian company, which is also the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi had served as EU President in July, Mogherini traveled to her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shake's hands were taken in Brussels with excitement, as well as they invited the Kreml Chief for October to a Milan Economic Summit.
All nine young people started their training on Monday at Emz Hanauer in Nabburg.
Among these is Azubi, who has already completed another training in the company before.
In four training courses, the new staff are in future active: electronics (three trainees), mechatrons (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the Azubis come from the countrykreis Swandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidt, Johannes Beer from Neunburg, Felix Domayer from Oberviechtch, Daniel Carenfree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd, and Ferdinand Strebl from Tenz.
The new trainees visited mainly secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainers from all year rounds, as well as trainers, take a team training session to Oberemberggau, where, among other things, there is an entire day-long journey and raiding on the inside of the program.
The company numbers 435 in Germany and 950 in the world.
The number of students distributed throughout the year is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouth shut and put France in order," said the most important binding of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply rooted link to show "your love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet training has been lost in the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves each man's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said with a great appeal.
As a disturbing gesture, the Prime Minister held that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite severe demands after the closure of the regulation of the new Minister of Economy, Emmanuel Macrons.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had called on his Mitsozialists to show themselves to the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the minister of justice, pursued a campaign in which she met an exhilarating socialist spokesman and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, defeated the ongoing civil wars of the Socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one to make them, they are forced to form a new government if the old has never survived a summer.
"And the new will not even survive the spring or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated her party's call after Parliament's resolution and said that she was confident that she would stand up for the elections as a winner and be ready for the government.
The ruling party in France experienced a decline in the municipal elections in March and the national legalized front in May in the EU elections.
A survey in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French are of the opinion that the socialist party is exposed to the threat of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Netherlands 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve any improvement in the economy and the unemployment rate.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.
Norwegian Cruise short before a deal with prestigious cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cross-border provider, is leading, according to experts of the industry, further negotiations to acquire the competitor loan Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous company, while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end in vain.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 per cent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources are asking to remain anonymous, as negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise limited company in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which operates together eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 per cent compared to the previous year.
The cross-border industry is around $29 billion, and in the coming years it will be expected for it because of the strengthening of the middle class in countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position for these new customers as the best choice for cross-border providers.
Prestige Cruises invited the US regulatory authorities to join the poll in January 2014.
Apollo has been the company's majority shareholder since a $850 million deal 2007.
Norwaygian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a free-time and casino company under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the capital city in January 2013.
Genting held at the end of June 28 per cent of the shares, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 per cent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises are available together according to the original application documents for the arrival of Prestige Cruises over 82 per cent of passenger capacity in American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists judge China on the day following the election decision.
A group of pinging-like groups weakened the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for leadership elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be composed of three members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be eligible for election and pro-democratic activists to make their use of drugs and to slow down Hong Kong's finances with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and the Chinese leadership is afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which the Chinese Presidency was represented on Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on election procedures in the Special Administration region, where hundreds of thousands were marched into the city's business area and organized a sit-in.
Lis inquiry is organised by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Presidents of the Standing Committee of the Law Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Office for Affairs and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in Hong Kong the following afternoon before the lead site office.
The United Kingdom saw no democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiew to include "State talks" with Austria
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government set up the fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and take immediate action to "statehood" of the region.
His speech, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of Austria under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that his status against Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Government to negotiate with the pro-Russian opponents on a scale similar to the strategy that it has seen since the beginning of the enlargements five months ago: Help for the separatists in the introduction of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly declared region Novorossia actually independent of a alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the withdrawal of the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were introduced in March and April, following Moscow adjourned the Ukrainian peninsula of Crime on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the unique area as "Novorossia" or "Newrussland", a term that reminds of the revolutionary splendor of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who were involved in the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for elections on 26 October and while government groups attacked civil communities in the areas occupied by separatists, hoped to "in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to engage in extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state of South Turkey, in order to ensure the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statelessness in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiever leadership for months, in order to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas, to endanger their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can tell the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker for correction of Putin's "failure interpretation" highlights Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east in contrast with the direct accession of the crime, on which most of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have been far more difficult to tackle the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in Austria, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and questions from the time of the conflict have been raised for the rest of Ukraine.
The autonomy spoken by Russian diplomats at international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving Kreml de facto control over a area that is linked to the Russian state area.
The five months ago anactivated half of the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian sea as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
In addition, the regions between the Rostow region in Russia and the Crime are rich in mines, factories and pipelines, which make important components for the Russian military.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko announced that the Ukrainian legislation - according to Neuwahlen - should consider amendments to the Constitution, with which the regions concerned would be subject to greater control over their finances and the status of their languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with those of the Kreml and of the separatist rebellions that are caused by the armed forces and opposition of Moscow.
Putin's last appeal to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the height of the eye, followed a further campaign of rebellion in the past week, after Russian troops and panzers entered the former peaceful region along the Asowsche Sea in Austria.
The Russian-supported separatists took over in the hands of the Ukrainian security officers, who said that the first step of a campaign to take the strategic coastal region to crime is to control Novoassk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have been launched to establish Mariupol, a steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoassk and the small access to the semi-crime.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leadership in Brussels and took urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, an former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're just ahead of a point where there's no going back," said Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign sponsors are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide to take concrete action to lead the draft additional sanctions against Russia, which should take effect in the event of an undisclosed separation of Ukraine's crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian Panzer columns and 1,000 soldiers had been admitted to the Donzkregion for the last week to support the displaced separatists, Oberst Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were killed by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk, were replaced on Sunday against 10 Russian citymen who were arrested a week ago in Ukrainian territory, shared Lysenko on Sunday.
Naked photo channel for Australian promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a joke about his pastors about Hacker, who may have taken pictures of his deceased Gabi Grecko and a who is the one who has stolen the A-Promises from Hollywood.
The film city is surprised after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking channel about promises on the Internet.
The responsible hacker probably has over 60 photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tribes of Panama" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, it was reported that private photos were also made because of an iCloud-Lücke public.
The list is 101 promises.
The first one who had spent the last month with Grecko said to a confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and given to others.
Grecko, for the time in New York, reported on a news site that the hack was "slow" and that the victims felt "destroyed".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-Freund Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she sits up without a pool.
"Love is invisible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actor Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence' said against TMZ: "It's a terrible loss of privacy."
Player Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "To post stolen images from a phone is nothing but the sale of helware."
Clean should not be tolerated by the spread of stolen images.
Radler, Jogger and wanderers were there yesterday at the 8th floor of the Great Feldberg and thus supported the "Help for Sick Children" Association.
The tour, which was for a torture, was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed: It made fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Upper Brauhauser was driven by the wheel to the Feldberg yesterday.
For good purpose.
The small muscle cat can easily be removed, especially for him on 8th row on the Great Feldberg for the "Help for Krebskranke Children" (Frankfurt) association has also brought about a valuable personal experience.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - great!"
Little birds on the sidewalk in the applausive curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
As Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Obersursel Parliament, many of the 718 participants stayed in the morning to the mountains and came near the creation, but fortunately on the platform.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the good eleven kilometers long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green Politicians who appeared in the Red Cross - red Dress, red Bike - did something else at the start on the substantiation ("Every amount of profession, there is the goal!"), however, appeared on the mountain as half a profi and went for 45 minutes without an atomist goal.
He also went through the street in a Rutsch, as well as Nina Kuhn, a press speaker in the city of Oberursel, who had made himself along with Frank Grünesen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "This is about Charity, because we like it - we'd have done a ride without it today," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The young (12) was taken down to the upper part of the morning to climb again to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had moved in at nine o'clock in the morning to "make the Feldberg twice" to go home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Fritten-Toni."
For the head of the Upper Kultkiossks, bicycles are easy to use over the Feldberg.
He's been playing with his 6.5-kilo racer for 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I would like to do it," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained manager says he's a "obtained racer".
This must be him too, because he was on the "Fixie-Rad" route, which is also running wheels, but without turning...
The fact that it also went off without a wheel locker up shows not only the 20 wanderers who climb up over the white wall and the foot stop to the summit, but also a jogger who pulls a car line with weights on a cord.
Berwacht-Doctor Volker Lischke, who equipped with his team with Allrad-Bully and Quad, took care of security, said: "I know" from Frankfurt, which is trained for a special slender train, only that he keeps the locks on his own."The man is therefore certain of his own sleek dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent to groups on the street in the morning.
The walker first at 9.30 a.m.
It followed the first drivers and runners by 10 hours.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers released.
Bent Hansen, president of the "Radeln on the Great Feldberg", gave the initial command and wanted the participants a beautiful trip.
For the next year, he hoped that it would slow down the road to the camp beyond the security of the participants.
