At the end of the trading period, the price was reduced
In the morning, the damage was carefully corrected after the morning hunger strike.
The transactions carried out by the Czech Energy Administration (CHEZ) have been valued close to the trading day.
In fact, since the start of the second trade, he has continued his weekly smoking since almost six percent.
Right now, there's a drop in Wall Street's shares.
We also call for the market's reaction to the outcome of the US Presidency's vote, which restored support for the financial sector's stabilisation plan.
Participation in Asia
During the Assyrian invasions, the participants lived through a dramatic period of time, whereas during the day, the showers lost part of their losses.
The Hong Kong Hong Seng index was almost four per cent registered during the trading process, but later lost part of the losses and reduced the decrease by approximately 2.5 per cent.
In Hong Kong, in Hong Kong, the Chinese shares accounted for 3.8 percent of the Hong Kong Enterprises Index, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
More than five percent of Sydney's nuclear power has been lost, but the losses have finally decreased to 4.3 percent.
According to the Taiwanese index, 3.6 percent of the population died.
"The timing of American healings has no doubt and has an impact on the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, director of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, however, is part of China's monetary policy itself, independent of the Central Bank of China.
In Hong Kong, the bats are at the same level as the United States.
According to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should resume negotiations immediately and accept the financial system's support proposal.
In particular, it is a threat that other countries will experience the consequences.
Blood clotting of American particles
The U.S. Presidency rejected the plan to support the financial system, which would have cost 700 billion dollars (at least 12 billion dollars).
The legislators therefore allowed President George Bush to call for the support of the plan.
Bush says the plan will solve the main causes of the financial crisis and will help to stabilize the whole economy.
The U.S. shares survived a blood transfusion last week, and the leading shares indexes recorded the largest smoking for 20 years.
The Dow Jones saw almost seven percent of the world's population in 1987.
The index has already occurred before the vote, but when it was discovered that the proposal was not accepted in the representative's office, the index began to be released.
Congress returns: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The U.S. Prime Minister of Congress and President George W. Bush have established the Agreement in a longer form and in financial assistance for the American financial system.
That's what they're voting for in the beginning of the next week.
The US legislators have been in breach of the negotiations on the approval of the mental health care scheme in the form of financial assistance granted to the US financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about a quarter of a billion dollars).
But I haven't won yet.
Congressmen must conclude certain parts of the agreement before they can make their final form and votes public.
The financial system support plan shall be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Thursday, he informed the Reuters Agency of this information by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee of the Pensions.
According to semantic sources, the plan is likely to vote at least once.
According to governments, it should be reported that the planning plan is being approved, which is the first key factor in the development of the financial markets.
Thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, however, it is called "delegation".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We took a big step.
We have clarified our different views on the form of a package for market stabilization," said democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
You think the final vote can be held on Friday.
The legislators met with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Minister of Finance, for the final form of government money.
This should be purchased from financial companies in the form of unencumbered label assets that cause serious losses to financial companies and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are the only ones to reach the final agreement on a plan that will work and which must be equally effective on the market.
I still need to continue the reform plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signage of Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the participating markets, which are extremely high.
According to democratic senator Harry Reid, legislators are therefore obliged to stop at Congress on Friday.
They also want to discourage investors from moving to the Asian monetary markets, where the decision of Congress may have a primary impact on the weekly trade.
At the same time, however, it is not clear whether the American Congressman's two friends, when they vote on the law, are unable to handle any problem in the last minute.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next days.
However, the law is still subject to many changes.
The total amount of aid for the system shall be divided into two parts.
In accordance with the request of President George Bush, the first $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
The Congress may, however, block the issue of the outstanding amount, which was determined in the next 100 billion dollars and in the next 350 billion dollars, if it feels that the programme is not functioning.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
If the President can implement this decision, however, the Congress can reconvene the President.
Despite these changes, however, the programme remained the basis of the programme, which had acquired material instruments for purchasing the negative securities to lose their value, since several hundred Americans were unable to sell their trademarks.
"We're all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate should be on Sunday," said journalist Judd Gregg.
The President of the United States was also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush’s spokesman, stated that the president was satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and appreciated the "double efforts to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of bus charges
Christopher Dodd, President of the Senate Bank Committee, said that the legislators stood on the responsibility of the financial programme, on the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of benefits, and the extension of the financing plan.
The new law is also limited to the managers involved in the programme. It is also limited to the completion of the bus and the establishment of a basic monitoring committee.
The basis should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on this, and we've made great progress on a deal that will work and that will be useful to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan is also with the help of the owners of the house who have problems with the loss.
The government should issue new shares of interest on the notes purchased by it, with the aim of reducing the monthly interest rates of the taxpayers and allowing them to maintain their homes.
Marek: Illiteracy
The proposed plan was designed by David Marek, according to the Director of the Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"It's wrong because it's not possible to know what the problem assets are with the mechanism and what price they're going to buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said iHNed.cz website Marek the week.
According to Marek, it's not that important that the plan is being abandoned now or at the beginning of the next week.
"It is much more important that the congressman should refuse to support the plan this week and, as far as possible, give our consent.
The spiritual importance of the agreement to be born into a plan is to be approved, the most important thing at this time," Marek stressed.
Free download: MP3 devices against mobile phones.
We'll help you answer that.
While almost all mobile MP3 files are available for download, only MP3 devices can't be dialed.
It seems clear that it's better to buy a phone.
Still, there is a lot to do to get a special MP3 transmitter.
The choice depends entirely on the way you use it and on your own needs.
You're probably having a hard time getting a short-sized forwarder at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc.
Some of these music products do not appear to be of any nature, but there is no objective reason to do so.
However, if Polishs are full of art rock, jazz or blue bacillus, they probably dream of such a transmitter.
This is similar to the journey, which is multiplied - simplified by MP3 music.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
Some may not be acceptable for an interpreter to issue an eight-year-old crown, as a Pink Floyd region is likely to find it difficult to take a meat-based crown market audience.
It's a two-way friendship that everyone has enough room.
The choice is wide.
The survival of the elements also depends on
Some high-quality music is much more effective than the simple music presentation, but also for which most of the cell phones are not even imagined.
They're not even ready to go to college at the same time as the phone.
The primary functions, in addition to telephone and SMS transmission, can also play music and video, both uplift, have a better and more camera, and you can even navigate.
And if we take into account the smartphones and communications, it's gonna be a little computer in the pocket.
It's a little miracle, because there's no oxygen screen, and no single television can take photos.
The most functional mobiles have their backs too.
The more you use your cell phone, the more often the display sends you to the counter.
And music is one of the biggest energy players.
Small mobile devices are capable of playing music for more than ten hours, much less.
In this regard, the speakers (especially the most legislators) are significantly more performance.
That's why they're not gonna play you for a couple of hours.
If you're still on the phone here, you're gonna get your place of work for the sake of security - it's also about the most expensive products.
The MP3 transmitters will not have such a problem, and even worse ones will issue an ongoing operation for at least 9 hours with a backup.
The next problem comes up when you're uploading music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only limited parts of the equipment are available with a universal USB connector and not all of them are directly connected without the computer's special software.
Of course, music can be fixed directly to the memory card, but only a small card reader can be played without a adapter with thumbnails used in mobile phones.
There is no need for any special software other than iPod.
It's enough to download the devices from the computer through USB.
Most of the mobile and viewers already have their own library set up by the manufacturer, the album, the name of the opera, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some of the devices are only designed to draw a structure similar to the Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, easy phones with operating system).
It's easier to handle than the receivers, the mobiles know more
In particular, the selection of a specific device is interested in the preservation of battery life, memory capacity, sound quality and type of voice, and of course the ease of treatment.
If your music serves as a background for you first and only for a short time, for example, any MP3 mobile that sits on the villa is similar to you.
And that's actually any cell phone that's capable of.
You don't have to pay particular attention to what kind of music you know about your cell phone or the camera.
With MP3, all of them get confused, and the majority of the music that comes out of your mouth will be in this format right now.
The MP3 is one of the most legislators and the decisive majority of the instruments are also mixed with the WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) is less developed.
For example, better mobiles make online music available.
Check the appropriate pages (or other service) on the mobile Internet and buy the album.
This service can also be self-tested for the purchase of the music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of services is limited to the price and usually limited to only one radio broadcast.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally expected that the music will be controlled in the future by such a sales method (such as on GSM, on the Internet, or on the Internet without a lead).
Most people keep their cell phones on their own.
Whenever an attacker likes to hear something, his cell phone gets stuck in the pocket while the forgotten MP3 host is in the house.
However, they are still talking about whether you always have the audiences or at least the audiences.
If not, you can use the built-in audio player, with almost every mobile, but only a few MP3 features.
Many of the music mobiles will probably be the biggest benefit of the price.
In general, the lymph nodes are less than three times smaller than the corona.
You can get a pretty decent walkman between three and four crowns.
However, it limits your absence of a traditional audience.
The best and most equipped telephones can also be made in the traditional 3.5 mm light bulbs, even in the 16th century.
The benefit of the distributors is, however, a simple treatment.
In no way is it necessary to treat the most vulnerable (see our options) all of us.
The minimum function, which is usually similar to the magno or gramophone, is apparent.
There is no threat of interference in the form of an unknown mobile Internet, and there is no reason for this information to be taken into account.
What are we going to do?
The most expensive mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually open to mobile memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
Add the appropriate card to the maximum two-fold corona.
But be careful.
Basic types only support 2GB maximum capacity cards.
Only the most expensive can start with almost 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have your cell phone and even an empty MP3 player you would like to buy, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsungo, Emgeton or irivet.
On the basis of capacity (max. 2 GB) no more than 1 100 kroner shall be used.
If it belongs to the most important audiences, select more special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungok).
These devices also have special MP3 manuals, which facilitates the administration of MP3.
The most common in the sector is Sony Ericsson, which has a similar user interface to the special purchased MP3 players.
The MP3 brands above can provide the same service in the same category for up to four years, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, no more than 35 hours).
The first virtual servant has yet to come to Czechoslovakia.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market has become increasingly developed and our service providers offer services as much as their European partners.
Nevertheless, there is a need for us here - a virtual service that contributes to the material reduction of classical servants.
Maybe it won't be so long.
The Mobil.cz website has written many times that Czech servants are among the most dear ones in Europe.
On the other hand, the ČTU confirmed, which called for the attention that the price of the SMS is more expensive in Sweden than in other countries of the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission's regulation of roaming charges, it may be contrary to this - some of the mobile customers of Czech mobile phones will be cheaper from home.
How is it possible to compare Czech prices with Europe so high?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound counterproductive, because we have three mobile phones, and the penetration rate is 100% high.
On the contrary, mobile service providers claim that the Czech market is highly competitive.
Paul Dvorák, also president of the Czech Telecommunications Council, once again declared that there is no new servant in Chehorsa.
It may be true that the classic servant has not already had too many opportunities with his own network (but it is likely to be very difficult to find.
However, there is another possibility - the virtual service provider.
At the same time, there was a significant decline in the mobile market of virtual servers, followed by a significant reduction in prices for classic servers.
In the meantime, even before the large fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile Great Britain, similar sounds were heard.
However, he proved that such ministers have their place and can indeed be successful.
However, for example, we don't have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of Mobilking's virtual service in Poland.
This service provider will be able to acquire more than 100 employees over a period of less than half a year and will become the fifth largest service provider in the country.
In addition to the Mobilking, there is the Penta Financial Group, which is owned by the U.S.
Virtual service providers will benefit from a much more complex focus group.
For effective operation, the same standard service requires a much smaller client.
It is not the same as the high cost of building, mobile and car maintenance.
Virtual servants in the world are generally less expensive - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which are often opposed to less service.
For example, the Great-British Tesco Mobile offers at least five percent of its competitions.
But as the example of the Polish Mobileking shows, it can be a whole good move to a target group.
This service is the same special focus for men.
"The real men choose the Mobileling Service - which they like to trust," says David Seibert, director of this virtual Entertainment Company.
It's hard to say if we can get a picture like that of Poland.
Miroslav Čepicý, Vodafone’s dictionary, argues: "The Czech market is relatively small to the semensive approach based on the majority of virtual servers.
In addition, the supply of services has been extremely satisfactory."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance that the mobile services will be stopped.
However, it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual service in Czechoslovakia, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful development of the project, but in Sweden the agreements do not seem to be too promising.
In order to launch Mobilking, more regions are being held in other countries," said Jana Studničková, a spokesman for the Penta Financial Group.
In addition, he has confirmed that the Czech mobile services are not overly concerned with this idea.
On the contrary, they strive to make every effort to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group is no longer interested in starting the virtual service, which therefore wishes to take a new step in order to become a real competition for Telephonica O2 business.
"We are very interested in providing mobile telecommunications services not only to our customers but also to our customers.
More than before, it's better.
Again, we have discussed this opportunity with all Czech cell servers.
Some of them have already succeeded in making progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the speaker of the group.
Maybe it'll be a better time.
No official information seems to indicate that we can be happy for the first virtual servant by the end of the year.
However, the birth of a child is about to take place at the same time as impossible to listen.
"At this point we do not think that a fully-value virtual servicer would be in the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special in contrast with the other markets.
He has not always told us the subject of a complex and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sršön on the website of the Telefónica 02.
The Czech market also refers to the special situation of other providers.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile’s dictionary, adds with the exception of O2: "We have not yet marked a single-life and twice-achievable business project, which could be further based on it."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network it is unlikely that by the end of the year, any virtual service provider will disappear.
At this point, there should be a specific agreement at the table, so that it can be considered at such a short distance."
Vodafone pays more attention to the implementation of its 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav Čepicý adds: "We have been involved in possible negotiations with virtual servers, primarily in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We're just keeping this to the most cost-effective in the case of the clients.
Vodafone's main strategy is the partnership in this area for the development of fast mobile networks."
Responsible offices - a hall with servers
The process of mobile service providers can easily be understood, a new entry of service would mean a rise in competition, a reduction in cash flow and a reduction in its benefits.
So why would we make it easy for us to enter such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate with one another, they also witness the birth of the U.S.
The highest pressure for ČTU is likely to be difficult for the birth of the U-Mobile company.
This is evidence of the publicly available information on the ČTU website.
But right now, U.S.'s coming up with a good idea why we don't let the virtual service enter.
Martina Kemrova added: "The environment of the mobile market has recently led to the entry into the fourth mobile market.
Given the significance of the Czech mobile market, it is obvious that a new player's entry into the market and service will meet high requirements."
In view of this, however, the full lack of interest of the Czech regulatory bodies is reflected in the provision of mobile services.
It is not just about the accession of ČTU, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to engage in economic competition.
That's just right with the Economic Competition Office.
However, the office is clearly referring to the whole problem.
"The approach of the virtual service mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider has been concluded on the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has yet been concluded because the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not of proper interest to the traditional servants," said Kristián Chlapua, a foreign class of the Economic Competition.
No one would likely miss such an announcement from the service providers.
However, from the point of view of which consumers should represent their interests and, apart from others, deal with that no one can live on the market, this is more than weird.
Exceptionally, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual servers work generally, we can note that we have taken steps to reduce the price of mobile services."
However, the pressure for the proper functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices is probably not within the interests of the EU.
In fact, there is a complete agreement between the three mobile providers.
The question is, if it's really just an illusion, it's about itself.
At the same time, the exact same gas stations are likely to be the only instruments of unfair and difficult competition.
"The office did not cover the signs of uncompetitive proceedings in this case, so it is not appropriate to intervene in any way.
One service provider does not have a leading position, i.e. no greater responsibility for market realities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual servers are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
Displaying the market leader’s position is one of the many points of reference.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, based on the communication from the single market in the face of economic competition.
After such a market, of course, there is no single Czech servant in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer another view - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the virtual service provider to be established.
And the mobile server has a monopolium for its own network.
So, in a particular case, it's necessary to dominate.
But even if we do not accept this opinion, it should be at least as powerful as three mobile servers appear to go.
Interested parties' complaints (including the above mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they are facing very similar obstacles in the process of dealing with all service providers.
The challenge of accountability to ČTú is a relatively common pressure in telecommunications, with which the EU will take over the whole case.
That's what we've met in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the newly adopted telecommunications law, the extension of the ČTU legal framework in the field of economic competition has not been successful in telecommunications, although a number of experts have hoped to improve the situation.
This must be well known to the representatives of the Lord, but it is likely that others are interested in it.
It works when no one pays attention.
The operation of certain virtual servers that are already operating in Czech mobile phones remains unclear.
These are companies that issue their own mobile service prices, which are only partially public.
It's about companies dealing with the same multilevel marketing.
Like Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The prices of these companies are generally limited to the chosen ones.
The product is found to be a classic company in view of the service provider, which provides a large amount of SIM card.
Receive special prices (and other benefits) after being an exceptional customer.
The problem is that all Czech mobile commercial conditions leave the same precedent.
"If there are any cases to be dealt with, it could be about understanding the terms of the contract which we would deal with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrova answered our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that the information about the activity of the Efféle would have reached the people responsible for the mobile services.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, this can be said about several hundred employees.
There is no protection against such a procedure.
In contrast with the activities of these companies, they have the same unfavourable benefits and, in particular, they do not threaten their own official markets.
Miroslav Čepicý warned about the possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only uses a percentage of the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on our phone is not on their list, so they cannot be fully available as regular mobile services.'
But ČTU should be at least exaggerating.
In addition, another question is addressed to the Lord.
If mobile servers lose sight of a similar procedure, why do they prevent virtual servers from giving birth?
It must be made clear that the EU has a very strong right to prevent fraud, and if he does not want to, he should not be satisfied with explaining to the service providers that they did not have anything to do with it and that their commercial conditions do not permit it.
When we're not the most beautiful
As mentioned in the text several times, access to virtual servers has led to a significant reduction in the cost of mobile market services.
In particular, in all countries where virtual servers were created, the classic servers have tried to prevent them from creating more and less.
The objectives used by them were practically the same - too small, possibly excessively satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, at these moments, regulatory bodies were introduced, not in any way protected from the interests of mobile providers, but from the interests of their clients.
It was then even with formal measures or with information pressure that the first virtual service was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are offering the whole case to each other.
On the basis of our findings, we cannot be exempt from the impression that in these cases, unexplained competences are good for us.
But don't give up the fight.
If the background information is really good and the virtual service is really soon displayed, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If any of the service providers would allow any virtual mobile service provider to be established, the EUOHS can only remain difficult to avoid further stakeholders (for discrimination).
And in other parts of Europe, we may not be able to call anymore.
The new church has four new versions.
Choose which is the best
Listen to four processings of the new version of the Czech State.
Sunday's Prime Minister Mirek Topolán presented his new recipes on the day of the Czech State.
The sky and the National Film Festival are organized by the leadership of Jiří Bēlohlövov.
Four versions are available with male or female speakers, with songs or instruments.
The Caterina Church and Adam Plachetka dream.
The writers Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček, who made the divine change.
The iHNed.cz website can listen to all four versions.
Czeh is one of the most beautiful gods of all time.
Cseh Radion has previously said that he has chosen a young representative song that is both expressive and popular.
"If you're going to be with both of us from the beginning, and later in the music, I've tried to get to the pure dictation, the meaning of the text, and to deal with it in harmony," he said.
The Czech State will celebrate the 175th anniversary of the future.
Where is my home? The title part was first held in the Rendi Film House in 1834 by Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, finished with the music of the Franciscan Shcroup.
It's kind of nice, and people looked at themselves spontaneously.
And the first race of the party became a natural part of the state's god after the Revolution of 1918.
Once the Czech Republic was granted a residence permit, one of the seven State symbols remained.
How the "new" heaven
For the first time, the railway undertaking shall also carry a chip card.
On 1 October 2008, he shall write himself as the date of his entry into the history of the Spring Central Station when the first route to the subways, villas and buses is to be set up by electronic buyers in the pocket.
The coupon can now be purchased about a hundred times with the OpenCard chip card.
Travellers can buy 30 days and 90 days and an annual quota (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and can also travel to the Chipcards at the Central Railway Information Centres and at the Museum, Moštek, Nádraží Holešovice, Angel, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobylysy, Rajská Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka metro stations.
The purchases are also available on the Internet since yesterday at www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by several customers in the 4th century.
Those who start using the Internet trade can finally forget the cost of metro plants, where they still have to carry out long-term courses for the railways.
The coupon can be purchased in the same way over the Internet and will be sent to the Opencard card in one of the tens of thousands of books of the Watchtower Library.
"In these places, there is a lot of customers who help interested parties to buy online goods and their cards," said Martin Oppatrní, project spokesman.
In addition to the libraries, electronic buyers will be able to go to Opencarda in some of the autos provided in advance.
How do these cars look?
Pirosaks, the rapporteurs, and the passengers may have noticed them in Rozty, Budapest, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska subway stations.
"There are now five of them in the city, but they should be eight by the end of the year," Opatrní added.
Check the box automatically instead of the driver
It's easy to handle automatics starting their operation tomorrow.
It's enough to place the Opencard chip card and a previously paid coupon away from yourself.
Electronics are not only in the capital since tomorrow, but also in the neighborhood.
Thus, between 300 and 499 buses and bus stations around the city, mainly by road to the city.
"In the context of integrated freight transport, fish were seen with cardboard vessels, which, with the help of the buyers, also established the validity of transport," explained Filip Drapal from the Rupid organisation.
Cars around the city are built by the driver at the bank.
The driver must therefore show not only the chip card but also the Opencard to the location specified on the cash page.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the doors.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the buyers, it is easier to ask the driver for this," Drapal said.
Travelers who travel by bus outside the city and do not remember the validity of our purchases will be able to go back to their car rentals.
The information on the validity of their texts is displayed here on the device label.
The suspects wanted a vote from the United States.
The Germans were asked to marry the United States in 1945.
This is from the letter that is contained in the collection of the Scientific Library in South Korea.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is likely that some groups of Germans who were charged with this wish were transferred to the United States President in 1945.
This is also evident from a letter from a private archive that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Korea in our day.
Česky Krumlov's Germans in the letter ask the American President not to allow the return of the "shuumava go" to Czech Republic, which Hitler has yet taken on the basis of the Munich Treaty.
"We have correctly understood the situation, and we really want to be sure of the words that the American groups, according to which they come to the German territories, are not in any way oppressive or hostile, but in the letter, "People whose hearts are singing the flag of the Shumava."
In view of the fact that the association with the Czech Republic has been established by the Germans - in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - can only give hope to abuse, inadvertentness, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter asks the American president to take over the protection regime "more and more".
"We can't believe that regardless of the opinion of the four million people, this area would be judged by a foreign country, which I believe and defends the minority, and nothing at all would contribute to the victory of the alliances," says the letter.
The reason why the writers couldn't write down is that I'm afraid of the "chseh prints" box.
Therefore, if the president of the United States had any doubts in the view of the Sumavian Germans, it would be sufficient that the Sumavis have a referendum on whether they want to become part of the United States and whether they want to live under the auspices of the United States.
If the text of the letter seems to be a little bit vague with the current knowledge of postwar history, it is appropriate to describe the expectations of the imprisoned Germans.
Even if the Czech Germans had to be at least able to learn about their exit from the country, they knew little about this opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would stand in the same autonomy of their citizens.
Others were confident that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, a journalist born in the Czech Republic.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German Buddhist during the war.
When the British were arrested at the end of the war and taken to the Dutch concentration camp, several thousand other Czechs helped him teach them how to do so.
"They believe that when they go home, they're welcome to the Czech language," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia felt that they were expelled from the country on the basis of the Benesz decrees.
You don't think you're paying!
The sensitive campaign attacks leaders
In the case of the church, the most expensive action towards road safety.
This would also be the case with the media campaign that would like to be launched by the Ministry of Transport.
However, the Prime Minister of the Republic expects this campaign to remove the leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be on television, on the radio, on the music, on the Internet, and on TV.
The leaders should be removed from the fast growing and alcohol.
And you should also remind them that they'll be stuck in a safe hole before they get there.
First of all, young drivers, motorists, criminals, and not later will want to talk to the celebrants.
And what does it mean in the ads?
It's human history that's offensive.
This is also the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think you're paying!
The word "you don't think" is written in great letters on the system.
And in his blood, you pay for it.
This must be illustrated by the fact that a person can pay for his life for a moment's neglect.
The viewers have been "removing" until 2010.
The ministry was developed by campaigns similar to those in English, where victims of accidents can be seen on a regular basis.
They hope that this will reduce the risks and have killed a number of people on the Czech side.
The announcements were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Move, move, move the horses.
"To the soldiers, 'take it, put it on,' his order is valid.
'Take 'em to the numbers, for example, when they pass through the pyrotomy, so they save time.
'Take 'em' is a crime or a danger.
The driver needs to remember the risk," says Martin Kořán, a psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why the information campaign is needed in the press, firstly in the negative campaign, thinks the psychologist.
He considered the driver to be less effective than the risk tables.
"If the risk alert table is prepared, it is likely that soon the environment will not be dealt with by the leaders," he warned.
I'll be able to return all the areas that have been set up for peace.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke about the return of virtually all areas in 1967, namely the rest of the Jordan, the East Jerusalem and the Golan Islands, to peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
That's what he said in an interview that was published by Jediot Achron on Sunday.
"We must also deal with the Palestinians, which means that almost all of us must return the whole (red) area," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We maintain a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians must deliver a similar percentage of Israel's territory, because without it there will be no peace," he said.
He recognized that the possibility of a return would also hold me in Keret-Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and primarily wants tractors and bulldozers not to walk through, as one of my best friends has done, Jerusalem has to give up a part," said Olmert, following the attack on two July cities, where some people have been killed and some of them have been tortured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple, Holy and Historical sites" in the city.
"Those who want to protect Israel's sovereignty across the whole city must integrate 270,000 warheads.
It won't work," he stressed.
Excise of Golan fensic acid
He also expressed an opinion on the expulsion of the Israelites from the Golan Peninsula, which was considered to be an impossible condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose peace with Syria only on the basis of the expulsion from Golan," he warned.
"The hearts are well aware of what they have to say in order to get Golant.
The current relations with Iran are to be established; the relations between Hezbollah and Hezbollah (situated movement); the regular support provided by Hamasz (situated movement), Al-Qaida and Dzsid (holy war) terrorism in Iraq," the Minister pointed out.
After a accident, are the passengers stopped in the buses?
The law doesn't know them. It's not allowed to drive in a remote bus.
In connection with the tragic bus bus accident of the Student Agency, the question was raised near the Italian Padova, whether passengers and passengers can travel to the bus.
"If we want to keep the law strictly and formally, it is contrary to the travel activity law," says Karel Hanzelka, head of the Ministry of Transport.
In the past week, the death of a six - year - old passenger was likely caused by a passenger driver passing by a bus.
The girl's accident was on the driver's side at the moment, at least in the safest place of the bus, although there were two more places left for her.
The bus can be slowed down, or it can be slowed down at the moment when the passenger coffee is served or offers news.
It's important if the bus is available according to the marketing authorisation.
If there is no approval in the bus, the passengers should sit down.
The Student Agency's remote buses do not have their seats; which is confirmed by Radim Jancár, the director of the company.
"We tried to find a solution to this ministry, and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, they did return, and we found that the passengers could go to the meeting on the road when they had their own seat," he said.
The law doesn't know the passenger.
"There is no clear legal regulation on the role of travel - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services.
The road traffic law knows only the rules of the driver; it does not define the rights and obligations," makes it less clearly a Hanselka dictionary.
Josef Pokorní, Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Production, is opposed to the view that the problem is handled in accordance with the law.
"It depends on whether the bus is involved in a business permit.
And it's over," she says.
According to their distinction, the buses may be cities where they are located and limited to maximum speeds, as well as to those between and within the city, with higher speeds and higher speeds, and with no distance stations and with maximum speeds available, with safety belts.
Like on the plane, the expert says
In Jaroslav Horín, the BESIP transport safety expert has no basic problem in driving passengers.
"We can compare the situation to the service at the airport in the course of the ongoing operation.
It's not safe here when there's turbulence and air traffic jam."
"If, however, the bus is slowing down, of course, the physical laws are valid.
Just like the city buss or the villas.
The safety of passengers should be covered by the driver's internal rules," he says, and at the same time he believes that the problem has not been solved by law.
Jancúra is ready to cancel services
The Student Agency provides travel services as a single bus driver.
Two hundred passengers were employed.
The manager does not keep his employment at risk after the accident.
"But as soon as I'm stressed that the employment of passengers is risky, I've also been disappointed.
The coffee and the news can be obtained when passengers arrive.
It would also be cost savings," he says.
The lack of passengers was due to security interests in their businesses, Alexei Litvin, the Asian Director, who works for two companies compared with the Student Agency.
"We're not going to travel, we're going to resist this from the beginning.
It's going to end with some deadly injury before or after," he said almost a year ago to Tyden.cz.
An unexpected tragedy occurred
The company's two-year-old plsenian passenger died during a napolitous journey.
Without the likely use of the Slovak truck driver, he escaped his seat and survived the road of the bus.
The bus driver was suddenly confronted with a manoeuvre, but the bus was a better escapeer.
It would also have been sold to Jancú, two permanent places to reduce passengers.
"These places can't be taken from the distance roads, they're blocked."
The company wants to follow the truck driver.
The Agency does not wait for the judgment of the court to punish the family of the girl, but it also expects financial damage from the guilty party.
- Rehabilitation?
In the future
The correctness of the movement of passengers can be seen on the bus side of the legislative amendment, which works for more than a year by the third-party expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"The group, however, did not have any concrete results.
The buses are not so much, rather the focus system is on the car system with maximum speed allowed and the use of mobile in the drive," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not hold on to the activities of passengers, which would pose a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," said Hanselka, adding that the control of the safety of buses is closely linked to the influence of the police and the employment offices.
The Diesseldorf's hopes for Frankfurt
The letter of the WestLB government to the bank's employees is not quoted in great terms.
The desseldorf’s financial units and the dekfort Deka-Bank unit could be created by "the central capital market organisation of the Financial Financial Group" - writing a letter published on Monday.
WestLB will enter a permanent "competitive block" in such a business.
Such a link could be made available to further accounts in the banking sector of the decision-making period.
This is the reading when a government wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the unconfirmed WestLB bank is still under heavy pressure.
Not only the EU Commission but also the Federal Criminal Service Supervisory Supervisory Authority, who has recently been informed by the Government of the North-West Banking Province to extend the deadline for finding a permanent solution.
However, there is already a good time for insurance companies known as Deka-Bank and WestLB for investment funds - a part of francfurt.
Franz Waas, director of the Deka-Bank at the end of August, knew when he learned of the crash data that the bank in Mainzer Landstraße and a bank were located in Mainzer Landstraße, such as the Helaba or WestLB merger.
In spite of this, the Director of Deka, one of the banks in question and one of the representatives of the insurance companies, has entrusted the Authority with continuing negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
At this time, the capital market or certain parts of it may become a word.
The negotiations, however, are establishing a financial environment - they're just starting now.
The name Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the francfurt financial sector, is not first mentioned in connection with the consolidation of the insurance sector.
In 2003, the Deka-Bank seemed to be alone with the Rhineland-Pfalzcal and the Helababa Landesbank.
However, nothing has ever been done from the third alliance.
The plans were almost publicized, and the coastal government spoke against the interest of Helaba.
After that, the other two banks didn't find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was founded in Baden-Württemberg, instead of the state-of-the-art Landesbank.
However, he re-examined the relationship between the Deka-Bank and the resident banks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, President of the Government of Helaba, spoke against the plans of meetings with his bank.
It is therefore independent of the recognition that there is a need for the approach of the various banks of the central sector.
Now, following the elections of the state-owned collections, BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected first.
This isn't necessarily good news for Helaba.
If pressure on further mergers is increasing, potential partners can be slowed down.
In South Germany, there could be only a few more businesses, but both the financial crisis has been significantly better sold than the Munich and the Student Banks.
The merger between WestLB and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, 85% of Hessen-Thüringen's business in Helababa, was completed at the beginning of the year.
You'd better stay in NordLB.
However, such geostrategic considerations represent only one side of my mind.
On the other hand, the question is how different business models of individual banks are to you.
In June, Merl stated that the German Tax and Tax Association had not yet responded to the decisive question of the business model to ensure the future of existing banks.
Finally, it is possible to imagine that WestLB's assignment, which they do not want to report to you.
Thus, the Italian government also writes that they are entitled to a "complete solution" anyway.
That this is how it is compatible with the unity of the individual units with the Deka-Ban, it's still his future song.
The second weekend of October was known as "last week"
This is the first time that Luca's third or fourth time.
Now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything else, says Luca.
On the other hand, Kaiser has a strong bodybuilding experience with a five-year-old man, and it shows about 200 people traveling the Oktoberfestre, how deep they can get out of the truck.
Elena first kisses Luca's face and then kisses her.
They came from Bologne to Verona.
From here, from the porta Nuova in front of the bus park, four buses start at 23.45 a.m. with the aim of "Destination Monaco, festival della Birra", arriving at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses, mostly Italians, are on their way to Brazil in the fourth.
In one of the park halls, the South Americans have already gone to bed next to the gymnasium, and the meeting has begun in the evening.
And it's so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who has a long, professional hat and a wide, active blue eye.
He spent five years traveling to October, only three times this year.
It's night there, in October, at 22.30 a.m.
The hotel's just a cover-up, Marco says.
The route goes to Euro 75, which includes a German-language tour of Kaiser, which has been extended according to the law of the Bajor.
And the buses are taking you to the airport at Brennero's tonight.
It's okay, it's gone.
As soon as the bus stops, the passengers are asleep.
That's all right, they'll still need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are a lot of Italian buses in the 8th parking lot in Munich.
When Marco groupes the plan according to the plan, half a week after arriving at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are about 50 other buses that have come from Europe.
Elena, Luca, and the others at the meetings, Marco still has one last piece of information, informs us of the dating plan.
First: Everybody pick up the orange juice.
On this page, you can read "Oktoberfest" on this page, along with Marco's travel agency's internet address: "conoscersiviaggindo.it".
Next time, "When the killer's hats are opened, flight" Marco gets in the morning.
"Fuças!" is the location of the flight and the rear of the seat.
"Not in front of us, because we're going out, and not in the same direction, we're going to sit on all the dirty shoes, but we're going to put them in the seat!"
It's going to Euro 8.25, Marco.
And don't stop drinking.
"Show the security guards how to behave well.
When you leave the places, they'll take it."
Third time, "I'll be back here at ten o'clock tonight," you understand?
And Wiesn's on his way.
In the course of one man’s journey, he binds black hats to the trees, the tables, and also one of the big Bajore people's selection plates.
You need to get ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of October, known as "last weekend".
There are no accurate figures; 50 percent of all visitors from Italy are from Alpokon who visit the Alpocon in their sources.
The Munich Police will strengthen the seven South-Third Police, the Italian Volunteers will assist the Bajor Red Cross, which, in their national statistics, includes 200 medical supplies of Italians taking the first place in front of the districts (kb.80) and the British for the state-of-the-art (kb.60).
In the Italian area, the Hofbrüu racer was particularly fond of.
Unbelievably Nights for Those Believers of the Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, the Federal Finance Minister of Peer Steinbrück stressed last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "visually" and in his statement, he also argued that the German banking sector does not envy the critical developments.
Because this is the weekend.
Daxon, a company owned by Möncheni Hypo Real Estate (HRE), received billions of loans from the German banking firm to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person who knew the situation told Reuters this week that credit grants amount to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should only be paid after the request has been received.
The money comes from private and private banks.
There's a loss of Depfa's apartment in the back.
Depfa, which is responsible for state funding, has paid money to long-term projects, and has recently refinanced itself - which is no longer possible because of the uncertainty prevailing in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash balance decreased by EUR 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and its own capital level decreased by 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Net revenue from the past year and the financial statements resulting from the same year shall be returned to zero, from the approvals for follow-up and from the determined securities, and from the calculation of the credit target amounts of more than EUR 5 million from the 70 per cent reduction.
Only 16% of the costs incurred by the restoration of the former Depfa group were significantly reduced due to the loss of the final cost of the calculation and the loss of damages in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation and to the companies concerned.
Following the privatization in 1990, the former State Financial Supervisor was exposed to pre-competitive properties that were later distinguished from the Aeral Bank.
Since the classical state funding could be short-term, the Deffa has made itself more powerful in infrastructure projects, as well as in private investors and government joint projects (PPP) and has expanded its activity internationally.
For the benefit of disadvantaged countries, the Hippo Real Estate should now carry out descriptions that are "simply effective" to show the group's results - which are generally announced.
I mean, it's not about paying for the shares.
The division has already been reduced to the third in 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has become a major state- and infrastructure-financer since Depfa’s transfer.
Other funds depend better on the refinancing of the central banking market, as there are no customers.
The American Lehman Brothers Investment Bank concluded two weeks ago that the banks' trust between each other was broken because the banks were monitoring their liquidity.
In order to refinance the Depfa’s real estate, a portion of the Depfa credit portfolio - like EUR 50 billion - is needed for short-term refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the group's funding requirement is limited to the time when credit is available, and the company has protected "the current high level of the impact of operational international financial markets."
According to other sources, the refinancing is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the HRE, stated in this regard that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not be required to secure the money markets until it is available.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Pensions Service (BaFin) show that the Hypo Real Estate group is already in place.
It gives hope to bank participants and creditors.
But the dynamics of the crisis and the indistinguishableness of the crisis cannot be certain.
It is not even possible to imagine that funding should not be fully required.
But this opposition won't stop.
After the late summer of Saturday, according to the news, the bank was still on the side of your chest, it was still unable to ease the tastes.
My shareholding was reduced by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
In view of this, it is possible to maintain the bonds of bonds.
While the first duty rates are almost changed, the subsequent scheduled liabilities are significantly reimbursed.
In particular, the crisis concerns the previous situation, the responsibilities of Württemberg Hypo and, where possible, the excessive driving times in 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously a speculative investment alternative, the values should now be considered to be based on the stabilization of the international financial system and in the light of the fact that the financial institution contributed to the crisis at the expense of Depfa.
As long as the notes, governments and low-risk business banks are still ready to support the system, it can be triggered by the loss of revenue.
Or it comes to what no one is currently hoping for to cope with the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, the reports relating to the partial stateisation showed that the limited probability of certainty was currently a legitimate hope.
For long-term creditors, the decision to choose from their investment can lead to sleepless nights.
Short-term investors may, however, use the sale to represent the content of the taxes paid after the fall in the following years.
Sylvana and the secret box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up at the Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to say, "The German girl's "fucking"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the nuns - she's talking about Japan in the new cseredia blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was on my way to school on vacation.
I'm staying on the road to Tokyo, and I'm going to Kavasaki for 40 minutes on the Tachiban High School.
I had to find the road alone, and luckily, I didn't.
It seems that the teaching is not taking place in the Tachibana as seriously as in the home, in Alsó-Szazire.
Students start to talk for eight hours until they start a short conversation with the teacher at 8:40 a.m. home room.
But before the teaching began, I had the chance to show it.
And I'm not the kind of person who speaks to people, mostly in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet had my school uniform, I took up an old habit of wearing a blue, white hair and black leather.
So I stood in this dress and tried to forget everything, "Szajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - Sylvana's name is, I came from Germany, and it's going to be a week after my birthday.
At this point, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language for two years.
All 31 girls got up, got tired, and I've heard the word "fucking" all the time.
I've known this from my mom.
This is the basic concept of Japanese girls, and it means "cuki, honey."
And then I went to my place quickly.
In addition, the girl was deeply moved, and she felt a deep appreciation that she had been sitting with the ceseredia.
The back part of the watch was quite quiet, but when you spoke to the deaf, they usually broke up.
Everyone spoke and commended him, and his questions reached his ears, and it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
And then everyone packed his bento.
I can see that he made me a meal like this - it's completely different than the ten-year-olds of the Holy Germans.
I've got a haircut, a little cloves, a salad made from eggs and eggs, a fruit, and a little tofu-drinked meat.
Most of the time, I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan.
Food looks weird, and they have a completely new drink.
I mean, it's all very good.
Well, yeah, maybe with the sweet-fashioned butt, brrrrrr!
In Japanese schools, the bento is not just a meal.
Presumably, a girl gives a boy her own handmade bento, which is especially artificial - in the hope that she can get to know him more closely in the lunch season.
That's what I read in my poems.
I'm curious if I can watch this here.
"Why in Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always answered:
"Because you're just getting married."
After all, I've been reading the songs for the most part for years.
And that I understood the pictures and the culture that they described, and I started learning Japanese once.
It was so clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
'Cause I like tradition and habits.
And they're in a lot of trouble here.
Japan is one of the most recent technologies and trends - and another is strict, armed and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I've never felt lost to myself, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
The rats have feelings, too.
You're going to have a pack or a lot of danger.
Joseph LeDoux is a neurologist who is convinced that animals also have feelings.
But how can you examine whether you feel the same way when they treat us the same way?
For years, well-known scientists have published the articles in the "Edge" web pages.
SPIEGEL ONLINE is one of the series "What's true without proving it?" from the answers she received.
I think that animals have feelings and other knowledge, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, and it's true that we can't even prove that we know other people.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we examine other types, and in the sense of feeling or generality, we question our knowledge, we come to a difficult place because the hardware does not agree.
When a package is placed in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills itself, goes away, or strikes you.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in comparable subjective experiences by some researchers.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
Human knowledge-related goods are almost always part of the page's pre-frontal issue (because of the role played in the short-term memory and implementation/management functions).
This vast area is more developed in the case of humans than in other major groups, and it seems that other species are completely lacking.
At least we know about the aspects that depend on the border crossing, such as who we are, or who we are, in the case of design and decision-making capacity, can reasonably be expected to be different from the other key elements.
Another dramatic characteristic of the human language is this: Since human experience is important in relation to language, it is often assumed that knowledge depends on it.
In this case, animals can be sold.
However, even if it does not depend on the language, the language will certainly influence it, so that the animal knowledge, whatever it may be, is likely to differ greatly from most of our knowledge.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what knowledge may be in the case of other animals.
If knowledge is not measured as internal and subjective things, and because of our special hardware, it cannot be measured on the basis of our own experience, then our research is of serious concern to us.
Most of my findings relate to the content of the knowledge assurance, but there is also another aspect of knowledge that is likely to be more accessible to science.
It would be possible to examine animals without regard to the content of the scientific process, and that is precisely what happens in the case of a short-term reminder of the main subjects, particularly in the case of visualisation.
However, under the conditions examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, knowledge is more closely linked to foreign relations than to causal mechanisms: Both can be the same or not.
It also stresses the importance of pre-frontal integrity in the development of visualization.
What is the result of this feeling?
This leads me back to activating an emotional system, such as your fear, in a way that is pure of its own activities.
What we call "my friend" is the mental condition in which we are when we take into account the activity of the localised protection system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions).
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the areas of the population, which are characterized by people and especially people.
With the help of the sign of language, feeling is a good thing, because we are able to distinguish and categorize them with the help of words and language.
In this regard, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings are derived from the simpler activities of both the right and the right to exercise, such as Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the wrong.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can play an easy role in the broad sense of the species.
I think I can't figure this out, but I can't prove it.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear of rats and people is likely to be the same in both cases: How can you verify that rats and people feel the same when they behave the same way?
A bastard goes to the danger, does he feel afraid?
In my view, the same behavior has not yet proved the same experience.
Although the neutral comparison continues to help: the rats and the people are the same as the insects, the insects are not.
But is the agent responsible for the feelings?
And even if this could be true of people, how could we prove this to be true in the case of the packs?
I think the packs and others offer, but maybe even the crooks (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove this.
And since their feelings are generally different from theirs (because human knowledge is special and language-based) rather than the emotional behavior of the rats than their emotional feelings.
On the other hand, fishing in this area is at a neutral level, if we measure the same size in packs and people.
As in the case of packages, I don't look for language and knowledge, nor do I have feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
Others may appear to be short-lived access, but I'm more likely to die than I'm going to be constantly sneezing.
Because I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of the UEFA: time of training for Poland and Ukraine
Mr Ivan Vasjunik, Deputy Prime Minister, announced that the preparations will soon be under direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government, in its decision of UEFA Bordeaux, sees the confidence and testimony of Ukraine that Ukraine is able to organize the European Union together with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our countries.
The work has just begun, and there are still many interesting people in both countries."
For the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, there are two visiting countries remaining.
It is possible to reduce the number of EC stadiums from eight to eight.
"We can't spend more time.
We need to work very fast now," said Grigory Szurkiss, President of the Association of the Red Cross in Ukraine.
"UEFA will continue to keep us."
In Poland, you were even more radically affected.
Following a number of amendments, the National Olympic Commission entrusted the leadership of the Polish PZPN, which was confirmed by independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission took part in the initiative of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It's called "some danger that PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules" - Drzewicki announced to the Polish PAP Agency.
"In writing, we assure the President of the UEFA that this will not adversely affect the EU's 2012 preparations."
Only in recent years, several first-line teams had to be manipulated into the lower class and finally had to be removed from the league.
The newly created Dennis Quaid return
The dancer would like to advertise a new film, talk about his own experience, and now he's in trouble with his ex-husband, and Ryan Hollywood's former husband, Dennis Quaided.
The One Who Reaps - and Returns
His war of Russians was planned by Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-wife: The two Hollywood dancers fought with each other seven years before the public.
And Ryan, the American InStyle writer, interviewed last week for the first time, said about the answer: "Dennis had been very impatient to me, which caused me much pain."
And only after the vote did Dennis know how many women he was dating.
Ryan's brain stripper's new, "The Women's" media show, which tells us about a marriage breakup.
Dennis Quaid, who was resolutely responding to the incident of a cold-headed man, declared the 54-year-old color on the New York Daily News, "that We will be able to repeat and pass on the history of our relationship."
In addition, it's "skinned" that 16-year-old boys, Jack again, "reminiscently of the many pain and changes that result from the choice of a child."
While Ryan lived alone since the election, Quaid was born again, and soon became a father to a blacksmith.
That's why you're closing the next page: "My life is going on everywhere.
I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in the greatest order."
The prices for airport tickets and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European airports and hotels were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study in Germany, aircraft were less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of airports and hotels were even more favorable - so it can be calculated as a result of one of the studies of American Express travel and financial services.
The company analysed the data on the first half of 2008 and established a significant valuation in the second quarter following the first quarter of the price increase.
After prices grew in the hotel market for years, the hotels became much easier.
Between January and March, prices increased by an average of 6.9% in 48 European cities examined for 2007 by 41%.
In the period from April to June, however, there were already 3.6 percent lower prices than in the previous year.
This trend has been shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay less than 30 to 37 percent in the past year.
This lesson is seen in the low price of the dollar, which led "the American tourists to the pleasure of traveling to work".
The reduction of hotel rooms is more relevant to financial centres such as Frankfurt or London, such as the capital cities, e.g. Hannover, Kölnt or Stavanger.
In Norway, 26.3 percent of hotels are counted on a European record.
In the first quarter, there was also an increasing change in guidelines for airport prices.
As a result of the kerosene scarcity, the passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and the long-term flights required by the large fuel were claimed by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist class flights decreased by an average of 12.5 percent to the previous quarter, however, the business and the first class showed only a more moderate change.
In Germany prices were even higher than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany decreased.
The decline in tobacco production is partly due to the growing economic growth of the company.
The flight market has failed in a number of ways.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement on the liberalisation of air travel between the United States and Europe strengthens the pressure exerted by competition.
The situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines are losing their losses and that the number of airlines reported in the first half of 2008 is limited to 24 airports in Europe alone.
HSV 1:0 to Gladbachot
The Hamburger SV lived on the table in a simple and simple way.

The gladbachi player is only in the game later, and it's coming back from the captain.
He's got a message that he's clearly taken out of his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second floor," said Hermann Rieger during the journey leading to the hamburger arenos.
Not much has happened in my catacombs, due to the end of the snow, and most of them have sat in their place again.
Rieger was about three years old at HSV's physical therapy, with a higher view than some hairdressing players.
That's how his request was answered in the appropriate place.
Cornelius Jol, a helper, was tortured, and he showed his neck to the same degree.

His command could have been similar: Go to the second floor!
The order's been executed.
"Today wasn't always a good sight," she later met Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard's "showed it" too.
The final result of the hamburgers can be thanks to Mladen Petric chapter (11); and the fact that the very weak gladbachhes were unable to cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a great victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 this week.
The viewers have already celebrated their own lives, the arénasian blues, and the table on the outside, which he described as the class of the burden.
This will be a day of birth without birth.
"We know where we're going to do it," said Marcele Jansen.
It appears that the evidence between the table is more quantifiable than that of the HSV dominantness of the link.
Although the team has recently been committed to its operations - with the Brazilians Neves and Silvá, the captain Petrick and the FC Bayerns - it is easy to find yourself, but it is still not brilliant.
"We need more feelings and action," demanded Joel.

It affects the flight of the brain cells.
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing inconsistencies in researchers for years. The dark matter affects the speed of the brain cells during the so-called Swing-by manoeuvre process.
Experts believe that Albert Einstein’s general approach to relativism cannot be fully established.
The Ulysses' star has been flying in the universe for almost 18 years.
It's a threat to the skin's death because of its soon-to-be fuel supply.
Scientists have known for years a secret meaning, the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means the gravitational gravitational force of the gravitational regions, which in turn makes a gravitational pull, for example in the Earth's gravitational area.
That's how the dragons can store a large amount of fuel.
The European Research Centre for Cassini-Huygens used this physical pressure to the same extent as Ulysse sun.
However, what researchers have been doing for years: Aircraft objects do not behave as fully as could be expected under the ancient gravity law.
Instead, irregularities occur at speeds.
The dogs are suddenly up or down.
The physicists have not always found an explanation for this effect.
The significance was crossed by the anomaly of Swing-by.
Some experts believe that Albert Einstein may not even have a general approach to relativisation, which will make the mass of the substance in the area worse.
Stephen Adler's American physicist, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continued to insist that Einstein was not wrong, and the anomaly of the so-called black material is trying to explain what the stars were hiding in the universe.
"The anomaly can be responsible for the dark matter, which may even be found all around the Earth," says Adler.
The scientists have only been informed about the existence of the dark matter for just ten years.
Clearly, there is a gravitational force that can monitor the effect of other compounds.
However, the substance itself is totally invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light does not apologize or withdraw.
According to scientists, the entire mass of the universe is good together with the dark matter.

"He led to suicide" the modern-day forces.
At the trial, he agreed that a woman had become a suicide victim because she had been raped by him for years.
Cornwall, who lives in the Stithian community, spent 57 years in prison for Michael Trerise, after having witnessed an eight-year-old rape attempt.
The Turkish Criminal Court found out that she had regularly bound her daughter, Stephanie Randle, between the age of five and a week.
Trerise wrote in a statement, "I feel responsible for the death."
The discussion concluded that Randle, 34 years old, had become a victim of suicide in the fourth home of Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied her eyes to her face before the meetings while her mother worked in a bakery.
Trerise became his wife in the 1980s, and he re-elected Cornwalt.
Now she moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court proceedings, it was found that Ms. Randle, who spent a lot of time on the National Trust's professional organization, was subjected to two re-examinations of force twice a week.
In 2006, Judge Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who had previously been in love with pain and grief, said that her friends said she was "feeling dead" and told her about life.
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, died in his plymouth apartment.
He probably got caught up with a bag.
Mr. Randle's daughter, who wrote her testimony in writing, said, "I've always bound her and put her eyes in her eye.
I didn't have sex.
I feel responsible for my death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Tririse: "You're probably a strange fetisher, and you're sure that this sacrifice was disgusting to him, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unfortunate family member ended up murdering the victim.
Even more reasonable, however, is the fact that if you don't, the case may never have been brought before the court."
The judge added: "I pay attention to what Stephenie's parents have done to the crimes committed by you over the years.
If this hadn't happened, it would probably have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Important data was placed under the charge of a lossful official
According to the BBC’s findings, the official secretaries are accused of a government office that has seriously forgotten confidential documents in June.
The man's expert was sent from the Ministry of Defence when he left two carefully hidden documents in a container of Waterlobo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
This is a more legitimate charge of breach of the law, and there is no doubt about the plea of the guilty.
Frank Gardner, a researcher for the BBC Ministry of Defence, has seen a lot of progress in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would handle the case as internal affairs," he said.
The application which cannot be mentioned was lodged under the charge under point 8.1. of the Act, this paragraph refers to the protection of information.
The State Court proposed that the charges against officials be represented by the Metropolitan Police for the husband's most sensitive nature of his work with the Joint Committee.
The documents lost by Al-Qaida and the Iraqi army also contained confidential investigations.
They were informed of the decision on Monday and then moved from their home to an unknown location.
Residential contracts are paid on account of B&amp;B
The United Kingdom's housing companies can account for 80 million English pounds after saving Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government has spent 14 billion pounds on the protection of patients located in Bradford &amp; Bingley.
This loan will be paid to all companies using the money of the owners, including 59 housing contracts.
The President of the Association of Residents (BSA) According to Adrian Coles, that companies and members should be paid.
At the end of the 14 billion important exchanges, it will be made after the return of Bradford &amp; Bingley's indicators.
However, during the past year, deaths are due to 700 financial companies using the exchanges.
The Pension Services Board confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing contracts are also included.
It is unfortunate that the institutions that are still operating around ... must now pay the accounts of those institutions which were well under the supervision of the institutions.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We know that all companies have to pay in such a way that the amount of cash is in the office, and companies share 18% of the costs among each other.
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, the amount of credit amounts to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to pay 81 million pounds for the first year's payments.
Adrian Coles, head of the company's company company company, told BBC that he was being dishonest.
"It is encouraging that institutions should pay the accounts of less pre-preservation institutions which have taken place around the time of the adjustment of the housing market."
According to the BSA, no single company has been affected since its operation began in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to examine this matter in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount," Cole added.
The amount paid in 2009 shall be up to seven months from the end of this year from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, a full-year fee is to be paid, which can even be doubled.
Since the housing arrangements are self-employed organisations without participation, the members will eventually have to pay the bill, both at higher prices and at lower rates received after their inputs.
The oil price is rising by five pounds per litre.
In Jersey people have to pay more for the tea.
Jersey's insurance company reported that from a week onwards, five more pennies would raise their wholesale price as literate.
This is the second price increase since the increase in two pennies in February and after an examination by a consulting company.
The respondents decide whether to continue the price increase to consumers.
Before the fall of February, the price of Jersey's gross trade price was changed in 2002.
The previous parliamentary representatives of Bangladesh were denied their request to be protected free of charge
The Court of Justice rejected the request for protection from former parliamentary representative Sheikh Hasina, which means that they can be detained when they return to the country.
His lawyer said that the court had refused to protect him from the crimes committed by him in connection with the claim that there were 50 million taxes on a businessman (729,700 dollars) in the time of parliamentary representation.
This case is just one of the innocent charges that have been brought against you.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Ziát was released this month.
Sheikh Hassina has to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her partner, the Awami League, follows that the interim government supported by the country's military will give her full freedom in advance.
According to the authorities, although it was conditionally allowed to be treated abroad, it is not clear from the conditions of placing the leg of the free leg to guard its freedom when returning to the country.
The lawyers say that it will now be brought to justice in the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court sent a request for Sheikh Hasina's advice that she should not be required, since she was already placed free on a temporary basis and she is involved in foreign treatment," we were told by a lawyer named Rafique Huq.
"We're going to vote against the decision of the Supreme Court."
According to the Ombudsman's opinion, it is therefore necessary to protect the country's freedom to return to the country and to prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina was expected to return home on October 17.
In June, he was released from prison to be treated abroad by a temporary government supported by the military.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both accepted charges against them all.
Concerns about the Afghan Police Protection Programme
According to the ENSZ, at least 200,000 Afghan children were left out of the recently organised police-protection programme because of the violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the ENSZ has organised its six-partnership defence action.
However, it was said that for safety reasons they could not pass on to the children living in some parts of the south-eastern Helmand and Kandahar.
According to an ENSZ spokesman, everything happened despite the promise made by the Taliban: they will not disturb or impede the work of the final, more than one hundred and a half main personnel.
BSkyB has been rejected in connection with ITV
BskyB was rejected against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its interest in the mobile TV network in ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its participation by less than 17.9% in the ITV.
In the past, the Commission decided that BSkyB would stop the competition and that the company would have a negative impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 and thus effectively banned the NTL - which has since been called Virgin Media - in the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that BSkyB would threaten the independence of ITV by encouraging the Competition Court to initiate an investigation.
Virginia's manager, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's control were all opposed to the purchase.
The BSkyB agreed that the reduction in ITV participation would be meaningless and unreasonably accepted - especially in view of the fact that BSkyB announced that it would be preferable to exercise voting rights.
Further examination of the case by the American Government
The U.S. Supreme Court appointed a special prosecutor for the investigation of the losses of nine U.S. government officials in 2006.
The action was followed by a criticism of the decisions of the government officials by the Chief Justice Officer on the case.
The accountant sentenced White House officials, lawyers and former prime minister Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was afraid that the State audits had lost their political importance.
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor, is now going to examine whether the officers who have been heard during the investigation have tried to stop the service of justice by lying.
"We have not yet examined serious charges of possible crimes and have not been cleared," said Glenn Fine, the chief supervisor.
One of the main suggestions was to name a special prosecutor who has the authority to report the witnesses.
The course began with the fact that in December 2006, the U.S. Justice Board withdrew from its entry into force.
In the meantime, they said that they had been forgiven for their failure to carry out government inspections.
However, it was later revealed that the missing government audits had nothing to do with a worse assessment than that of many of their colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that post-exemptions were due to political importance.
Some government officials took part in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others were not willing to take part in the investigation of complaints about elections against the Democrats.
U.S. government investigations are carried out and judicial cases are carried out.
They can pass, but they can't get away from their positions from politics.
The leader of the justice court, Alberto Gonzales, became the leader of the attack on state officials because of the losses, and he finally disappeared.
A number of other officials of the Court of Justice have submitted a motion for a resolution.
Gonzales, in his chief auditor's account, strongly condemned the role involved in the case. He considered that the highest official's "priority responsibility" would require forgiveness, "lost" part, and "expected" himself from the process.
Other honourable Members - including Karl Rove, the oldest Bush assistant - argues that they did not have cooperation during the investigation.
Get Meat Loaf eposing
The rock star Meat Loaf will be awarded recognition in the Q Awards Gale for the epipic god of "Bat Out Of Hell".
The song, which will take over a special dance award next week at the London Festival, said that it will hold recognition.
The nine minutes, five seconds long since Meat Loaf in 1977, was the title of the public record album.
Coldplay got most of the mark for the time fees, four categories were listed.
Paul Rees, the principal editor of Q magazine, said, "There are a few things that pass the time or functions limits, and the "Bat Out Of Hell."
Jim Steinman bought a lot of sound, and that was Meat Loafé's voice.
The section started with a two-way audio break.
In 1979 it was a small one, and it came to 15th place in the hives.
However, the album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the strike list for almost nine years, and then more than 40 million examples have been provided.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Today - is currently struggling with health problems. In many cases, he passed his surgery because of his heart rate in 2003, after he joined the stage.
In 2007, a few concerts had to be held because of high-powered engineering.
It was later discovered that she was found in the earphone.
Unknown city street where they are often stopped and may soon be sold
New York City has more than one thing to do with it, its surroundings and other attachments. Some of them are famous, others are simply engaged in practice.
However, many trained taxi drivers and long-lived local residents would find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small road is in East Village, and it's in the north on the First Road - without reaching the Second Road - the Bowery and the Second River.
Kb. 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more similar to a prairie switch than a main transport route.
There are no streets.
Usually you cannot be found on a standard map.
But there's miracles on the road.
There is, for example, the Avalon Bay, the construction of the recently built First Street Luxury.
He wants to redefine Extra Place again, and he would like to make sure that the new buildings can come into business and shop in a cleaner way.
Among the wonders of the road are the old-fashioned neighborhoods in this town, which he found in the town street, that this was the only place he had ever lived in before the revolutions of the surroundings.
However, the owner of the road, the city's building and development department is not interested in it.
At a meeting of the Land Management Committee, the city and the representatives of Avalon Bay made a proposal that the builder would buy his way this month.
However, the Commission would prefer that the road remain in the management of the city and requested a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, director of the 3rd government agency.
"There is a very small area already in the city's district, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"So proposals for the renewal and treatment of Avalon can be made, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public."
Avalon Bay reported a few months ago that he wanted to cross the small road again, and he wanted to stay with his rooms. These are some of the coffee shops that the construction worker is expected to give in a place.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy its way first came to the public this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that even if the company wants to use the road, he doesn't hesitate to turn around.
"Avalon Bay's main focus is to rejuvenate this broken piper and build a nice public place," he declared, adding that the city proposed its purchase.
Seth Donlin, the head of the Building Guard Office, said that the city really wanted to sell its way, and noted that the Office was responsible for the development of the buildings and not the management.
For a closer relative, the Extra Place has little historical significance for Bowery.
According to some, in 1802 he received the title "skin land" when Philip Minthorne broke a large bridge between his countless children, and no one in the small plot of land was required.
Punk-rock works closed in 2006, the CBGB's back door opened to Extra Place, and the route may be the most famous photo that was produced there on the album of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great place," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who produced the photo in November 1976.
"He was with eyebrows, with gloves, with gloves and pastry ribs, as well as with teeth and bonds."
Some homes, including bloggers, who write about how to take the Middle East Village into custody, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They agree that the property's heritage, whatever it is, must remain in the community's library.
Others refer to the Extra Place as a resort, which has been practically unchanged in the city and which has to be left at peace.
Jeremiah Moss, a blog post titled "Jeremiah's New York Distinction" ("Syrilm's book: a series of blog posts showing the history of the Extra Place" which appeared in 1952 in the title "The New Yorker" titled "Various Speech".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a small, small box that is still dark during the day, which is made up of dispersion, steel-results and spare parts, and where there are some news in the halls."
The road, apart from some exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A package was placed at the end of the road, at the back door, which has been leading to the CBGB, and is now in the position of a higher price-added clothing store.
There was a graffiti on the side, and an empty, 0,75 litres of surrespack was covered with a broken, fresh paper.
Some of the drivers said that the Extra Place would soon be on their way, but they think it would be better for the refurbishment.
Field said that some of them seem to appreciate the beauty of the current state of the road.
He said, "I've spent most of my life in dark, open and unsatisfied places."
Vita on bilingual education: Further coverage of the English language environment
In this part of the study, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi are examining their views on double education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher at the Csendes-Ocean National Political Research Institute of California Studies and the director of education, is a co-author of a book entitled "Not as Good as You Think: Why Schools in the Middle East Need for Education".
It is not easy to get in the favor of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
The recommendations relating to Barack Obama's education are also included here.
Obama's campaign says "Afro-American and Spanish private teachers are significantly less likely to receive a diploma than white students," and that is true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama has expressly supported the educational plan - among others - "a bilingual education" for English students.
At the same time, it is for Obama that the commitment to bilingual education, which is based on non-English school education, raises his interest in the pursuit of major performances.
Take, for example, the general school of the Sixth Street Prep contract in the eastern part of Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of the students - who have recently arrived - learn English.
In spite of this, 100% of the fourth classes have been awarded the excellent result in the 2008 state math examination.
It is equally surprising that 93% of the fourth classes were performed in an excellent way in the study of English and office.
This incredible performance is not valued by the instrument to which Obama would participate.
The Sixth Street is for repetition, practice, continuous evaluation of the equipment and for the prevention of seizures.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to the director of the Sixth Street, Linda Mikels, the school's teaching principle is "a full level of understanding" in the language environment.
The method of measurement is the exclusive use of English at the time of teaching other subjects.
Michaels, who hates bilingual education, said, "We've shown the first success in getting someone to a college, not realizing who was the students who came back from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It works," he said, "We don't work."
As an example, will Vaoo Obama attend schools such as the Sixth Street Prep, which are a significant number of Spanish students and English teachers?
The results of the school should be clarified in order to make the choice, however, because of its own education policy (the National Educational Associations support bilingual education) and since they are itself a result of bilingual education, we cannot be certain of Obama's reaction.
Despite the fact that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made a statement on the question when he said that people should not be so worried about the "only English spoken" legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should be able to talk to their children in Spanish."
If Obama really wanted to make it clear that the differences between the results would be reduced, he should carefully study the models they operate instead of looking at them and getting them into nothing.
The price of oil was increased due to concerns related to the economy
On Wednesday afternoon, the Italians are worried that the U.S. financial markets will not be able to restore their economy.
The profit sheet is returned to New York's Trade Center at $99.80 a.m. by seven percent.
Prices decreased by more than 20 dollars a week.
In the last two weeks, the stock market opened up the Wall Street financial grid, and some strong holes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price reached $145.29 in July, at the beginning of this month, almost $90 went back on Wednesday, before the financial markets had been reimbursed for irresponsibility.
On the weekend, the concern was renewed to the investors even after the congressional leaders reported that they had succeeded in completing the week's economic healing, which is the largest in the history.
The news has raised concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As a recent event, the Citigroup will purchase the Wachovia Corporation bank business, notified the government every week.
In time, the European financial conglomerate, Fortis, was established by Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, the results of the two-week bilateral agreements "seem to be a failure to raise the interest of trade in pessimism."
The economic situation is deteriorating, which is expected to reduce the demand for oil, for example.
"The future of the market for cereals, camouflages and currencies would become a worldwide proof" - the Deutsche Bank wrote an analysis to investors.
"We don't think the market for the goods is going to end up with the "study."
The biggest issue in terms of sales is the extent to which the US's "disease" affects the whole world, especially with regard to China."
As a result of the slowdown in economic growth, oil consumption has been reduced by the banks' analysis of their expectations for the coming year, with 20% reduction in forecasting for oil and gas prices for 2009.
The team's record with your second four bravado.
After spending more than eight years in the Jets forest than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played in defense at the end, thought he had seen everything.
But then he looked at your second fourth birthday when Jets changed a game without a point into a sensory game.
"I've never seen that before," said Ellis.
After your second four, the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals began to be fully compatible with the dark skyscrapers.
Brett Favre, a quarterback 12-year touchdown pass has given Laveranues Coles. This has been a perfect advantage for a south-east, which has continued to develop significantly.
Favre gave two more touchdown pass to Coles in your fourth, among others, when two cornerbacks followed each other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret poverty," said Favre about the passage to all Coles.
"Always good players.
We've been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Cole were fired, the defense stopped Cardinals' director Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, who was in the corner back position, caught a bad bag and returned to 32 yards that touched down.
Eric Smith, a safe player in the middle of a different pass, and he got the ball.
David Bowens, the linebacker was able to pull the trigger out of Warner's hand.
This last cycle could have been the most amazing move in the experiment.
However, when Cardinals lost his wallet in 10 seconds before the end, and Jets got it, Jay Feely got a 20-year-old box, setting up the score of 34:0.
This was the best result that Jets's got in a fourth.
When asked by Jet's teacher Eric Mangini to mark the attention of the game, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When they told him that both - in your third quarter, Cardinals bought 21 points that Jets didn't buy one - Mangini said, "I have to say that I enjoyed your second quarter much better than the third.
We've got a lot of points in a short time."
The little Gebrselassie has made his own world order.
The Ethiop Haile Gebrselassie again showed why many of the best ever-lived middle- and long-distance pilots have been able to complete his own world course on Friday in Berlin. He was the first one to arrive at 42,2 km 2 hours in 4 minutes.
The easy-to-be-to-peak, 2:03:59, successfully achieved the win at Gebrselassie, has improved 27 seconds in the previous result at 2:04:26, which is due in Berlin.
For 35 years, Gebrselassie has established 26th World War II in a wide range of areas, from 1500 meters to 1500 meters for every remote world activity, or for a global record.
A month ago, Gebrselassie left the peking Olympic Marathon - which, in turn, proved to be too careful - to continue to stress the astmatic problems of aviation.
Instead, he volunteered to the Berlin maraton.
In perfect circumstances - in the day, starting at 9 °C and at the end at 13 °C - Gebrselassie won the day, impossible, 2 minutes 56 seconds at a kilometre speed.
Since the marathons did not start earlier than that of Dr. Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to the longer distances, the maraton record has been reduced over two minutes in the last few years since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 at 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the victory of the Sunday, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, his legs were broken and he couldn't teach for two weeks.
Obviously, he was refreshed during the meal, and he did not wake up.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"It has always been perfect.
A week ago, I started teaching again, and today I had doubts, but it was all right."
He has suffered some criticisms - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's East-African Rivalis - which means he uses too much help during his competitions, usually avoiding a large number of world-wide maraton fute, leaving it to an Iramuite, as if it were flying on board, and replacing the world conditions of competition.
However, this criticism will almost reduce Gebrselassie's greatness in the long run.
Gebrselassie spent four days working on four Kenyan rockets at 1:02:04.
Two-week Kenyai runners, James Kambai and Charles Kamathi gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the fugitives were shot.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers before the goal, Gebrselassie left Kambai with a last print, with a second goal at 2:05:36, on the best of 5 minutes.
For Kamathi at 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Irina Mikitenko, the native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German national, closes the year of the week's victory at 2:19:19.
The World Cup holds the Brit Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last summer, the 36-year-old Mikitenko's surprise was won with the result of the London marathon at 2:24:14.
He was not able to take part because of an opportunistic infection in the Beijing Olympics, but he was quickly healed and healed the Berlin Marathon, where he was only five minutes older. This was the third marathon trip he took.
Okos has won the competition: first he has allowed Ethiopia and Kenyans to advance a four major group, and he has been led a great deal, and then 30 km away.
The Ethiopian Ascale Tafa Magrasa for the second time at 2:21.31, while the Kenyan Helena Kiprop became the third result of 2:25:01.
A unique city, the height and testing of the blacks
In the Great Orland park of experience - a few miles away from everything that stars, sounds, and powerful - create a quiet little town where the height of the African life was high and natural.
Eatonville, the first clean black city to be integrated into the country, which was home to Zora Neale Hurston's children, is no longer as simple as it was in 1935: "The five tones, three toes, 300 tones, 300 tonne, 300 towels, 300 towels, many towels and two towels, without prison."
Now he's in trouble.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee attended the annual Zora festival. Eatonville's celebration is held in honor of Harlem's most famous female writer, Hurston.
Yet, in many respects, the city which has been described and which has made tourism tradition - which is also a part of the floridian road environment, published by the Federal Offices of the Republic of Croatia Project.
Just as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote in a letter from Florida, urban blacks were often not willing to share real thoughts with white people who "know little about what they don't know about."
Even in this year, when black president Barack Obama opened up for the issue of Faji, there are many doubts about the views of foreigners.
"We are very concerned about how to tell our story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and was a member of the town's oldest church.
"You've got to tell me clearly."
Eatonville has long been characterised by my victory and the struggle with paradoxone.
At the same time, the historical importance of blacking is a model, while at least 2400 major communities, where poverty indicators reach the national average.
In part, an industrial group, and in part an example of the American slave trade that has been created as a result, he has sometimes looked at, sometimes because of the beauty, the south, the city, the black culture that flourishes at the prices of the peasants.
It's not surprising that the houses here are once proud and protective.
And the image created about Eatonville is important since Zora, (it's all called Hurstont).
In books written in the true, powerful dialect, such as the "Mules and Men" (1935) and the "My Eyes We Watching God" (1937) he showed his birth city to the world.
The floridian road book opened up five paragraphs of the city, which lies along the 17th road. This road led from the center of the old Florida to one of the black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in life and in office, as well as in the doppelganger, introduced his readers to the first city of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then entered the most reliable spheres.
He wrote: "We are better able to find the modern public school on the ground with white helmets, carefully held games and games that Howard Miller cares about, even though he can barely write and read."
He made mention of the new husband of Swedish Dash, and he wrote that Lee Glenn was "a lot of drinking, and anything that might be needed at the transitional hotels."
In a few hundred words, Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with autonomy, but at the same time with illiteracy, repatriation and sex.
It's understandable that Fodor's passport was shown differently.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Now he said things like they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters. He would have made them immortal by making them walk out of the beautiful things that men were singing about their beauty.
He added, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a student who has often visited home after his family moved to the Florida Jacksonville.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin admitted that when Hurston entered the city, he usually came to a poor Chevrolet, a cigarette, and a long-distance town, where people are still proud of their decent dress.
Most of the people were distracted, Franklin said, but they got a lot of fun.
"People were always happy when they saw Zora," said Franklin.
However, at the terrace overlooking the tower of Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely searched, he wrote in his own letter, "It's never been too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer released.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with a large part of the world, had abandoned it.
Although he had ever been a popular writer, Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard University in the 1920s, he had suffered a serious stroke at the Florida Fort Pierce, where he had lived before.
There were no significant reminders in Eatonville, or big, public readings.
"I don't think they understood how rich the world was or what left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, who was published in 2003 by Hurston, author of the book "Brooking in the West".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange and the officials wanted to build five roads through the city, instead of the double capital, Kennedy, which played an important role in the life of the community.
In this way, the territory of Orlando was already able to enter the city’s eastern border with Interstate 4 cars associated with the States.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still footing after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, the end of the forced integration of the community is a relatively idyllic indifference.
In the 1950 ’ s, the fight against fascism led to hatred with the community.
"There was a group of white boys in Akhori, and they sold their clothes on the street with oranges and other things," Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in it.
They threw a graffiti out of a car."
In 1955, in a letter to the title "The Orlando Sentinel", Hurston asked about the decision to impose a strong integration of the Supreme Court. Thus declared the decision "Brown v. Board of Education": "No more hurt or respect."
Today, people say that the school disorganization has been positive in some respects, has weakened the content of the eatonvilles, and lowers the confidence of young people.
"The black children have been forced to kill them - I remember - the man killed his teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N. Y. Nathari, Ella Dinkins, the manager of the non-profit organization called "We care about the Meg Eatonville Community".
"It's been until the students and teachers were born from a common place," he said.
"We didn't kill our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many others to celebrate Zora Neale Hurston - in black writing, coloring and art, who have grown up in his predictions, as he has done, with self-containing self-reliance and ranks, as the following: "How can anyone get away from my company's experience?
That's impossible for me."
In 1975, Alice Walker was assigned to Hurston's sudden cry, and she began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, the bookstores were written by Robert E. Hemenway, a well-known historian of Hurston's life, who again took pictures of America.
The construction project would have begun at the moment when Eatonville's most famous character was re-focused.
And this time, Hurston's former neighbor was regarded as a rescuer.
In 1988 the Community began organizing a Hurston festival to reassess what would be damaging to its main hall.
More than a hundred pioneers arrived for the two-year opening event, and since then many return to the meeting every January.
A few years later, he proposed the construction proposal.
"The main reason is that the community has renewed its pace, which means real civil prosperity," Nathiri said.
Boyd just said, "Now he saved Eatonville."
The success of the construction project has helped change the city's self-designed image.
A larger number of people living outside the city, such as Dr. Rachelle Munson, who started attending the church in 1993 and the locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville entered the National History List in 1998.
In 2006, he opened a new, unique book called Hurston, on the newly built and decorated Kennedy River.
Eatonville still has Florida's catacombs: it's not ten miles away from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like it's a foreign annex at the time of spring rain; it's as small as when the 27 black family was built in the 1880s.
(But the population is 90% black.)
They're still cautious about the foreigners who are looking for Eatonville's story.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest freshener, which is painted by a white man and painted blacks working on the ground - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, among others, are self-sustained Jones teacher, who, in particular, tends to be proud of our life - are afraid of neglecting their unique community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became ever more popular, parental pride grew.
In particular, young people look more closely at Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own race: amazingly, with problems, and with everything, they are not better, neither worse, nor worse, as well as proud, creative, anxious, confused, and confused as other species and ethnic groups in America.
A genuine civil commitment is made by Franklin's grandson, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to work with the local government or the police, which he thinks will help.
And it seems that young people have also learned to represent Eatonville properly, such as 11-year-old Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most of those who are just moving here think that this city has nothing to do with others," said Alondra Kenon shortly after his graduation one Sunday.
"But if someone stops and just a little time to get to know the story, it's a very beautiful city."
We all speak the language of money in New York.
Nothing's changed in the top.
If tourists don't care about the newscasts and the powerful television broadcasters in Times Square, I wouldn't notice that they're in the middle of a storm.
They would never come to the conclusion that the wine-based, soft-formed offices have been the heads of bankers and risk-based managers who have been in power in New York since 1929 who live in the last days.
The drivers are still carrying out five tests on the cars, transporting bags left with muffin for morning conversations.
There are still Spanish men who walk around the houses, as a human surgeon, a five - year - old superheroe, who are in the same shape as the truth.
The office workers are still in line for their pleasant breakfast on the train's dining table, and there is still no way to get a taxi on Monday between 4 and 7.
I didn't feel that there would be any crisis until in the afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I didn't decide to give you a new bank account.
I've been planning to put things in my local pockets of JP Morgan Chase in the days of the Daylights, but I've already had 20 people on the list.
Not on the bank’s bank account, where money can be collected or paid, but on the customer service bottle where the older customers have a checkbook, the tourists are asking for adjustment to Macy’s shop and where the new customers open the bank account.
A lot before me - I knew more about Start later, from the banker "ordained" - with the same heart rate as I did.
Unlike me, however, they have already borrowed their money from smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Credits were received from so-called banks (which are similar to housing agreements), credit agreements, and small-scale insurance funds that operate only in a single country and are managed as a permanent family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been corrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in cash, and when New Yorkers came home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was searching for a bank purchase of $440 billion.
The office and bot workers in front of me were transferred to a bank, which seemed to be a safe haven, to the bank, where most capital injections were done on the Wall Street.
The simple New York people have become experts in their finances for the past few weeks.
A woman in the local Chinese store phoned to talk about Lehman Brothers' bank and the director of a great audition, Dick Full, as if he were talking to a lot of friends.
And Lynn, my apartment's house-to-house unit, it's been a five-year-old weekend topic, not about Brad and Angelina, or about my food supply, as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I put all my money in the money market.
I changed, you didn't risk it."
They used violent screams while in the best condition in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, the best Austrian Free Party, and Filip Dewinter, the Belgian best party, from the Vlaams Benang, participated in a protest in Antwerp on 17 January 2008, in a poll showing the organization called "The Guards of Islam's Restoration Ellen".
Marks followed by transport tables, which were painted with a white line of cross-sections.
According to the police, best-selling skills are responsible for the interpretation of Austrian Muslim protesters, which took place in the same week when the best-selling parties played a significant role in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 calls have been made in the trauma area next to Linz, sometimes between Friday night and morning.
The prosecutors had Jewish symbols, such as David’s star, but according to the investigators, they had only tried to achieve the noble principles that stemmed from the hatred of the Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be related in any way to the elections.
A spokesman from the local Islamic community said that "when they were ordered" after the funeral, which was held in the Muslim religious month, not long before the end of Ramadan.
At the same time, Austria maintains an exchange of views following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the political dimension is better marked.
The two best-ranking parties, which received at least 30% of votes, were campaigned for the Future of the Freedom Party and the Association of Austria, for a strong anti-refoulement law, and some of their slogans were joined by a critical enemy.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, who received more than 18% of the votes, has also completed the campaign against adults and boys, and has also completed its evaluation of food that is clearly linked to Islam.
The party spoke of "European brotherhood" at the final, monetary summit, which would help to ensure the strengthening of Islam.
He wants both parties to ban the construction of museums and mines in view of the political symbols of their deployment in Austria and Europe.
According to the press studies and studies conducted following the most recent win-win elections, the change was thanks to the majority of young voters concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter was banned from a foreign trip.
Gary Glittert, who was sentenced to forced labor, was known as a rock star in France and Spain.
The Court then decided to prohibit Glitter for six months from notifying the authorities that he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The county police had been denied a ban on travel after the court had given evidence of the charges against Glitter against the children.
Glitter, a real name for Paul Gadd, did not participate in the Ashford Magistrate negotiations, but was represented by the Corker Binning attorney.
One judge said: "On 25 September, the county police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from planning a trip to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd doesn't mean it personally."
64-year-old Glitter therefore informed the authorities of the purpose of foreign travel, as this is required by the law on the registration of perpetrators of sexual offences.
It shall notify the authorities if they wish to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also necessary to inform the police at least seven days before the planned expulsion.
If he does not notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
The county police said they don't want to talk about Glitter's private cases and about his possible condition.
We learned from the Kenyan police spokesman: "The Kenyan police will do everything in protecting children in the country and abroad.
"Our opinion is that it is easier for someone to check if he does not leave the United Kingdom because there is a comprehensive system for us to be able to manage the potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the county police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continue to monitor the behaviour of the persons involved in reporting sexual crimes and other persons who live in order to minimize the risks that affect the population. "
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the rape of a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he had to drive to London.
But he stopped feeling bad about himself, and he didn't want to fly to London.
The territorial authorities did not allow the inspection, so they finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities were not allowed to enter the country, so they returned to Bangkok, where the territorial police and immigration authorities sought to return to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow Airport 3 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, did not go to the late London court,uxbridge, because, according to the request of Scotland Yard, he was sentenced to a court trial in order to report sexual offences to the perpetrators.
Glitter spent four months in prison to bring back pictures of children's education in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith, a local government official welcomed Glitter’s refusal to travel to France and Spain.
"I didn't make the photos on the stage because I wanted to show the art on a personal page." Günther Bauer Photo
There's no beauty, no bread, no dancing.
From the front of the flamenco grandmaster's body, the reaction is unintelligent: to recognize the face of the dancers' weekly.
Sometimes the art.
On the other hand, the man on the weekend.
And these two pages can't be broken apart, except in moments away from the open, public, when we can afford a personal movement, we can capture the depth of a mind, or we can focus on the beauty of the art of non-scientific action.
The German photographer Günther Bauer Flamenco-people celebrates the theatre of songs, dances and guitars with this less-known website.
Through the photos, it shows its own iconography of flamenco from different faces.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Film Festival, "flamenco shows the growing international significance of day-to-day flamenco" - believes the actor, adding that the Flamenco-people could be anyone's actor, since the images were shown to the viewer that these images are not typical of the art.
These people on the street have been given a lot of art that is capable of suffering, sadness, pride in their movies... and of ruining the public.
At the same time, photos of the film are not suitable for recording their personality.
Their personality and character are in the very best condition.
I would like to create a generous atmosphere that allows me to enjoy the personality of the great flamenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival led to a long trip to Bauer in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco songs, guitars and dances.
These portraits show the classic picture of the camera and the theme selection.
However, the use of different stylistic instruments has been interrupted by traditional image drawings and modernity. The next thought reflects the image of Bauer from the flamencoro: "This music with traditional children, however, is changing and always exciting."
It's not dance, it's not music or music itself, it's much more the artist's personality, it's the character of the audience.
In the days of the El Fotouma Gallery, the driving force of the actions can be seen with the essence of the cultural heritage, which can be seen through the sensation, the existence and the display.
The famous characters of the flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, reflect this collection of six artistic exhibitions.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon produce an album containing the portraits presented in the exhibition.
Bauer spent two years suffering from sports with the "SportARTProject" series.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is somewhat different from that, the artist adds: "Many people like to see people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or longer time.
I think the photo's the easiest thing to do on the platform.
With people you meet, people you meet, people you don't know, or people who only take a few minutes to take pictures.
But in spite of these circumstances, I always try to make my imaginations come true.
The exhibition, which was chosen from the short flamenco portal, is the exhibition called Flamenco-people, the Alameda de Hérculess with parous calle de la Mata 20 can be seen in El Fotomata Gallery until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa says the rain that works, "he's ready to wake up"
The scene and the action are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also famous for his new queen. The director of the region is a nationalist, Roger Casemant, who bought a dog for a year in Congo and Amazon.
The Irodalmi Nobel Prize was also a chance writer at Hay Festival Segovia's event last night that his current work is "close to transparency" and "all signs show that the kingdom should not be written."
"If I were more flexible, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope that I will make a point at the end" - with these words he closed his presentation at the festival of essays, thoughts and opinions, which was adopted in Aqueduct for four days by hundreds of writers, historians and journalists, as well as visitors.
"The city and dogs" was one of the biggest participants in the office's meeting, and it also changed its hopes.
Vargas Llosa has won the Hay Festival Award, a former edition of the Queen of Dickens "Our Only Friend".
Félix Romeo welcomed the audience after his thanks. The audience soon followed the hour during which the Peruvian writer had a profound memory and a great dose of humor, how he had developed his own life-saving skills and his desire to live; how he spread his story about the history of his writings by armed writing methods, careful documentation, many improvements and revisions; how his work was done by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandra Dumas, and what kind of memories he had of building.
The Latin American registrant acknowledged that it was impossible to read or show that the books were changing our lives, but added: "I don't think that the office has an empty life of entertainment or privacy," because it has an effect on people and thinking about them, so he asked the writers not to allow them to take advantage of their ease and treat them with responsibility.
In the shortest time of the Pozoblanco boutique, the hunting bikini are also left.
The traditionally organized horse bicaveded yesterday, organized as a bell of Pozoblanco, was removed from the workshop after the remaining horse-terrorists found it inappropriate for the Aréna field to travel.
As a result, the Commission decided, with the agreement of Fermín Boårques, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay with the Bicavia.
The periodical reviews were based on the calendar, since there were no two of the three calendars.
The second bicavia was left for breakfast on Saturday.
The leading players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castileblancó were fighting.
That's how it was held on Friday.
The mighty Daniel Luque became a three-footed home trophies, and after the eccentric and aesthetic struggle, they moved around.
In the same way, in the south-east, Alejandro Talavante acquired a number of recognitions and trophies, but he was more grateful to the public than to his own performance.
After that, however, El Juli, who had recently joined the Los Llanos Areina, became an adult.
After the second kiss, the majority of the audience succeeded in getting out of the stadium.
On board a two-toned vehicle trying to escape from road inspection
It's been four hours in five minutes.
The Bask District Police is carrying out marketing checks in the administrative area of Arminón (Dalava).
The authorities will stop a vehicle in which two passengers are on their way, and the passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of air, was not visible at the same time.
The investigators were sent to the streets, and one of them, a 28-year-old man was arrested and identified by A.A.J. - announced by the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and abuse.
The case took place in the administrative area of Arminón, where the Álava Forgalmí is carrying out a business check at the N-1 airport.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused permission, gave the gas immediately, and left the control station.
The investigators were taken to the station, and then the vehicle stopped a few miles away, and the passengers were taken from the parking lot to a forest area.
Finally, the Bask Regional Police took one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily truck, he took over his shipment of 2178 kilograms.
In order to obtain a thorough examination of the vehicle’s rear parts, the police authorities have submitted a sample of the vaccine.
In addition, during the verification, it was confirmed that the vehicle’s false records do not match the data contained in the vehicle’s papers, which is why the procedure is also initiated because of the intensification of the stored medium.
The Bask Regional Police shall carry out an investigation aimed at identifying, as we have already mentioned, the source of the suspended vaccine.
The 28-year-old accused, A.A.J., was sent to the police for the necessary hearings, and judicial action was initiated within hours.
Heather Locklear has been arrested for taking the medicine
Heather Locklear, the popular Manda of the Melrose Place series, held the police station in Santa Barbara, California, during the weekend.
According to one eyewitness, he tried to leave the park in Montecito - a spokesman for the People magazine of California’s commercial control.
According to the audience, about 16 hours a.m. Locklear "pressed the gas, increased the engine, forward and back, and tried to leave the parking lot, and later it passed through the sun several times."
Not much later, the audience, who probably didn't know the dancer for the first time, saw Locklear standing in a nearby car park and getting out of the car.
He also reported to the police because he was "indicted for Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the dancer was sitting in his car, partially putting down his car.
"It seemed closed," so the drivers were invited to a specialized centre for a medical and alcohol examination.
According to a police spokesman, the dancer was co-operated and the alcohol consumption was immediately out. The speaker also said that based on his first impression of the cleaners, he was under the influence of Locklear.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of being led by an unknown entity. About 19 hours were sent to the local prison, where he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of an arisonal sanatorium where he was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares uses the IU (United Kingdom) analogue federation to act in Silva
Gaspar Llamazares, Chief of the IU and United States today announced that the basic regional federation will be decided by the Sevillei Government in the case of Youth and Sports, Francisco Manuel Silva.
"I am a federal in these things, and this is evidence of the influence of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out to the procedure that the party should apply in view of its member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the IU President stressed that, in identifying possible irregularities imposed by Silva, the "visibility" must be kept in mind: "The IU has always been sent to peace to make such cases more transparent."
He added that part of the training was "the strict ethical code in the case of public use."
"Majous blood," Garci's epictomy.
Benito Pérez Galdós National Episcopals was appointed by José Luis Garci, who led the famous French rise in the blood of May, which, with the cost of nearly 15 million euros, was the largest in the film industry.
According to this, the director was asked to illustrate the amazing humanity and social analysis of the art of the famous regenerator. He told Garci in his film show Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría to the public audience of the films.
More than two and a half hours of Mayusian blood is shown in the music Fridays, and later it will be spent four hours as a minimum of Telemadrid.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós's government, has performed a childish dream with this move. He is grateful to Esperanza Aguirre, who has been confident three years ago from Madrid Tartomán to prepare a film for the 200th anniversary of the events of May 2. Garci has accepted the invitation under the circumstances if the National Episcopals can be given.
The 15 million budget was fully funded by the Madrid Autonom Tartom, and Garci was given a special opportunity: it could show "the lost Spanish people who were in a bad mood, as the fight continued for independence led to a severe loss of control of the country by Ferdinand."
The director also expressed his regret that he could not count on Alatriste or Goya's fantasy budget, which was more than double the Mayan blood, and therefore it was not easy to leave a few notes from the sales book, which - as well as many other times - are accompanied by Horacio Valcárcell.
So the Renewable Order went on to the usual working mode, with the colors that started the tests before the polling. Casting wasn't because Garci was holding the "measuring" and because, as he said, "the part of the governing party is going into the theater and music to find out what's going on in the world we're working on."
The Mayusian blood has several colors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranjaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci - who is with four Oscars and a Oscar diaspora - believes that the time of the Hollywood Academy of Spanish representatives, namely the Mayusian blood, the Hét France billiards and one of the most popular Vák fairs, is not representing the young generation of Spanish music, said.
Garci doesn't count on his movie.
"In the beginning you think you're working for the past, you'll find that only happiness counts, and finally you'll be happy when you're ready for another film," says Garci, after 30 years of professional research.
Isabel Bayón trusts the life and art of the Seville dancer Tötola Valencia
A sevilla flamenco dancer is remembered as a sevilla dancer.
Carmen Törtola Valencia, born in the fourth century, was born in Triana and was born in London.
He was a free dance artist and an expert in Eastern dances.
He fought for the equality of women, including Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against a campaign to defend women's freedom of movement.
It was a dynamic and aesthetic revolution in war Europe that led to the death of Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gambo, he'd suggest Trotol, who's really impressed by his personality."
The flamenco dancer declared the following: "Our goal is not to tell the story of life, but to capture the spirit of it.
Flamenco styles have come into view of dances.
For example, "fucking dance" to the Guajir, or "fucking dance" to the tango.
"Sercially dancing and others say that it also means my style" - for example.
The light of the presentation is two main elements: Miguel Poveda, after the opening door, is now singing again to Isabel; and Matilda Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with a former teacher.
"Matilde creates the oldest Torthol, the surviving woman.
I'm glad he said yes to the request, very honored to be on the drum."
In addition to this production, Jesús Torres and Paco Ariaga singers and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, from Pulga and Moi de Morón; El Pajaro sings, Rafa El Viola sings, and Juanfra Juárez, who "is always playing an enduring character with love for the true prize."
In most cases, it also shows a woman who lives in London, but also introduces Europe, and in the acorresponding countries, including India, the United States or Italy.
"That's why I'd like to remind her of her, because her personality had a great effect on her own age, but she doesn't know her appearance anymore and they appreciate her work less," says Bayón.
The show takes place at 20 o'clock tonight at 30 o'clock in the Lope de Vega cinema.
Triennium is also shown at the end of the "A freshly married wedding day"
The first illustrated edition of a freshly married wedding day will be in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916, Juan Ramón Jiménez was married to Zenobia. The presentation will be part of the program that was conducted by the Andalus Regional Cultural Commission on the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the dedication of the Irodalmi Nobel Prize and the annual anniversary of the death of both of the two of them.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are closing the new edition of the book, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize Prize for the Nobel Prize, and the celebration of the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Light Award". The exhibition opened in May, opened several parallel provinces and, according to the plans, visited the International Congress in New York.
The Committee of the Regions of the Andalus Regional Culture Committee has taken an eight-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-year-old by Perdo Taberenro and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Encisso, a fresh married day to promote the reputation and work of one of the highest-skilled couples.
Without Paul Newman, there's no such beautiful America.
"Sometime God created perfect humans.
Paul Newman was like that."
The story comes from a dancer named Sally Field, who works with Newman in a film called his victim, reflecting the horror and incompatibility that Newman's death in American music and all in America.
And how hard Oscart got.
returned in 2007,
and he was in the middle of a disease,
But that's how he saved everyone from death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to express our feelings in words, and now I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, "and he made my life better and this country."
No one was afraid that they might get into trouble or get over it.
One of the heroes of the music and home went through a particularly dark period in which fear of terrorism and market trends, American self-assessment and the search for duality.
When such difficult times come and it's so easy to lose the opportunities and so few people we can look at, there's no need for Luis Cernud to be surprised by Paul Newman.
In fact, he has proved to be a law of goodness and justice for people.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and was a protector of lost and opened cases, starting from the anti-coupling plant in the memory of the first-born son who was killed in the treatment process, until he established the bio-food market marked at home.
There was a real gift for a country that could hardly survive the self-sustainment culture.
The first miracle, without regard for nationality and origin, entered Hollywood.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, is not a man, but a bear died with him.
Another English, Oscar-Die Sam Mendes declared that his joint work with Newman clearly indicated his short-term success.
Russell Crowe, a bad guy from Australia named Newman as his biggest fan.
"He made the bed very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who today seek to follow Paul Newman's life - ask for satisfaction and away from serious and camera lives.
It's not always easy if it's possible today's media.
There's still someone who's trying and Paul Newman's example.
He was married once, but after five years in a loyal marriage to Joanne Woodward, and it would certainly have been a great deal of help to me.
"Why did you have another hamburger waiting at home for the cold meat?"
It can be proud of the fact that the girls on the earth are in one region that is not too common in America.
"Of all the creations, there was not so much pride in the role of a faithful man, a loving father, a caring grandpa, and a generous man."
An oasis of Madrid
Indeed, many dream of a Madrid Olympic, and after 2012 failed, it may be from 2016.
But I'm asking, are we really ready for it?
Because if we get out of the train last night, I don't think so.
They called it a perfect competition, but I think it was the worst of many that I've ever seen.
I mean, there's a lot of misunderstandings, and if you have to evaluate it once, and I'd be the investigator, it would clearly be the result.
Well, let's go to the river and start at the beginning.
The misunderstanding started with the translation of the series, so it had to come earlier.
It's not a problem in itself, but if you're getting older, at least get it all at least once (including the chip, which prevents you from standing later).
Well, that's not what happened.
First of all, the series was passed (first inexplicable, only to fall down) and (after the usual set), which was amazing, only S-s-poo (second intelligible because I had XL point)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or have they decided that because of the crisis, they're going to shoot the weapon, and they're just gonna take a little bit of polos?
But anyway, these things are still falling apart on the day of the race.
In addition, in the past, it had to go through the chip, the seat was held for 15 minutes from arrival, and it had to be handed down.
The expectation continued for 35 minutes, which is impossible in the case of more than 11,000 passengers.
So, as expected, the competition started, and we didn't give it back, when it ended, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made it even more convenient for more than 40 minutes to wait, which has been subjected to population and standstill trials.
I think we're going to get some research investigation at 500 tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, are not making our location with real time.
If you were to ask me about the perfect ride, it wouldn't naturally happen to me.
So I think we can keep dreaming about a well-trained Olympic city.
Search for Microsoft (virtual) recipe
At the MIT High-level Technology Conference, Microsoft has shown the development of a new representative and human interaction system, one of which is not too intelligent - a masterly intelligence that is capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it is possible to call a taxi (or a vehicle in the business area) on the basis of the information from the discussion.
This "reception" can be identified by using a camera and a form and facial recognition system to identify how many are in the room who are, in fact, observing what they are wearing, and then listening and understanding the key words of their conversations.
In addition, on the basis of the discussions, he can group the present.
The video shows the reception woman identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company she is talking to, and she does not use the company.
He asks if he's come to visit someone and ensures that he's ready to help him soon.
It's all white without a big picture.
It's amazing.
But it's, of course, his next song.
Today, the company also has a very important task to develop, for example, the new version of the Windows operating system.
Week after week, many have argued that Microsoft's strategy has changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and will have less powered.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computer instead of the many commercial eyes were to run the necessary programs, the machines would be five times faster - Bravo, Steve, this is already something.
They found the Spanish alphabet, showing that Microsoft has already added functions and extracts to Windows in every new version.
The change in direction is over.
Microsoft's right, the operating system is getting closer to the back, and you're the software.
When Google Chrome showed up on the network, I joined the idea that Google made the first step to make Windows compete.
Many correctly learned that a runner is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be required, as it is impossible to get access to hardware and software.
It's the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to his mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the operating system must be calculated, not in absolute terms, but in relative terms.
Ballmer's speech this week underpins this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
We only connect the computer to open Firefox or Explorert - or Chrome - and more time to download than we spent in the cloud world.
What, then, are most of the applications being used together with the system?
The smallest times more.
And Windows 7 is smaller, it needs to be less than Westan.
Less difficult, less literal, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services more online and ultimately to alternatively with Google.
All they need is an example of why.
I prepared this photo at the start of the month in an open-ended conversation with Microsoft in Redmond.
Instead, the seller automatically tells them a plate, they're using the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google for online browsing.
On the other hand, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced last week.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, actually, in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to get Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market together.
After all, the phone's still working as a computer.
But the cut, because Android and iPhone are already on the market, is going to ruin business anyway.
The Fabuleux Marcel
This was done by Pablo Picasso in Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Vérères, and Al Pacino in the home of Francis Ford Coppola, and this is also one of the basics of the gay shopping community.
And if we are already involved in listing the specificities, we can also trust the peaceful figure of the heavy burden of the Vándorcús circus.
But what are we talking about?
So about the tank, as the English people call it, but none of them can compete with the Le Fabulaux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of an elegant name - even friends just remember as a "Marcel" - which is thanks to the sport, according to the legend about the same Marcel Cerdan boxzolol, who received the name of a lover who sings "Marcel" by Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton, unisex hair, his own brand and his small (as well known) beads are also evident from his competitions. This is the last of the most marked models hidden in the polynomial ring.
But the Belgian company does not just make tanks.
Sports clubs, retro boxers, cassettes, gymnasiums, swimming pools, swimming pools, ministers - and we can still dance - all of them belong to the company's products.
And all of them belong to the category of comfortable sub-homes,
Even though it's sad that they have to be treated as inferiors.
That's too good.
"I want to be a young mother; everyone who's going to be the father."
She's very similar to her sister, but she's been able to realize herself.
Monica Cruz is small and strong, but she's full of energy.
Now the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the beautiful world.
For Monica, the modeling is more meaningful than some beautiful and beautiful girl gives her name to something.
It was now in favour of the new Paris branch of Mango and in the transmission of the largest dividends sponsored by the Spanish company.
You'll be caught by greed and greed.
Actually, what are you doing in Paris?
We'll show Mango's new Christmas collection, which we've planned with my brother, Penelope. We'll also take part in the launch of the second "Mango Fashion Awards" and in the celebration of Valentino's honor at Opera.
It's quite a dark day, the truth, but it's very exciting.
This is the fourth season at Mango's company.
We both pray for the 50s and 60s, and we've spent a lot of it there.
And then, often I just go to the city, and I look at women, how they dress, how they change and choose their clothes together, that's one of my favorite times.
You work as a dancer, a dancer, and a dramatist.
I think that's what I think, but it's all about three things, because there's a lot of them together.
I've been interested in clothes since I was a little girl, and I've been waiting for them to come to my grandmother's house, and I've got to get into my big clothes pockets.
Well, you were on the Kanaan, you almost got up with a glass of water.
And then as a dancer, I've always tried to look at my dress.
You know what dancers want to figure out our own style for the hours and the trials to make us feel good when we look at the scene.
And in the stage of the stage, you'll actually identify with your role when you get the signal.
You see, it's all about everything, and I respect all his designers and skills.
You recently celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no!
I feel better than ever, I love 30 years.
I think women are in real trouble at the time, they've already had enough experience and less mistakes in their lives.
And the biological clock didn't work out.
I've been doing what I like since I was young, and it's been a lot of inner happiness.
And you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm a mother because I'm born into this, actually, I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to give up on this.
And what about your stepfather, whatever it's gonna be.
I want to raise my children in happiness and great love.
Let's take a few words from the movie, and you probably got a lot of movies that they haven't shown.
Sure, and I'm just waiting for them to come out.
I'm the one that started at the theater, I'm very impatient and unsatisfied, and I want everything right away, but I know it's impossible.
I can hardly wait to show you the last hour and the Lord's voice.
I'm curious what you're saying to me...
If I know well, you've been dating Naomi Campbell for a few days.
Well, no, that's not why...
I didn't go out like a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he has just invited a charity dramatizer to London, which he has arranged for his own organization called for a better world. I have chosen two own Mango collections.
People don't even know how nice Naomi is.
There's so many people around here, so I know, and I can make sure that his side isn't right.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of the activity.
He asked for a magic show, but if he wanted me to stand up, I'd do it.
If the women in the third world are running out of tea, they don't know what's impossible.
The returning winter leaders will be obliged to prepare Alcolock
The Ministry of the Interior, after a three-week instruction, would be obliged to prepare a vehicle which would prevent the vehicle from being started if the driver is in a state of a weekly course or not to be in the vehicle.
The proposal has been extended in June and is now working with the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which says the pilot project will last a year.
Since the project aims to restore the vehicle, the vehicle will have to participate in a re-routing course on transport.
The test shall also be carried out outside the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute for Autosafety Technology (FITSA).
According to statistics, 30-75% of cars stopped several times due to road traffic are in the car again.
This will prevent Alklock from entering the vehicle because the system will determine its internal air alcohol level. If the maximum is allowed, or if the driver does not have access to the equipment at all, the system will not allow the vehicle to start.
The cost of more than EUR 1000 would be the normal value.
A 2007 study in the United States confirmed that vehicles equipped with such equipment could also reduce the number of regulations by up to 65% in the first year of training.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could survive this rule a year.
The measure also focuses on two aspects of regular assessments: in this way it is easier to prevent criminal offences,
to simplify the implementation of the legal reform as it is normally necessary to amend the basic legislation for criminal reform.
The operation in the Spanish market is not yet available in any commercial form, even though some industrial and public service vehicles have already been sold in the experimental mode.
The House of Lords will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which is responsible for the preparation of the system's schools in France.
In Mexico, closed shoes
With Angola's accuracy, at the time the programme was launched, at 17 a.m., 40 minutes was landed at the airport of Benito Juárez, Mexico City, at the airport of Asturiasi Hercegi Airport in Hungary.
The day was already late, but it was still so hot that we could only see a royal party coming out of the plane.
On the steppe foot, the Spanish giants and other rare personalities were present.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street, you know, that the Spanish Hercegi Couple is visiting the city official.
- Well, well, it's a good time for today's transfer... the woman's adventure or something...
- No, no, sir, the woman in Spain, she's only been here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press knows everything about Asturiasis Hercegi Par and the importance of their visit.
Many are expected to be in the red sky, on the 27th of the seabed, which is protected by the masses.
It appears that Herceg is dressed in purple, seawear, and Hercegne will enter the long hair of the wind, retraced clothes, but not in the ordinary, hairy shoes - it may have been warned that Mexico is threatened by wind.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras, and then enter the area where the official reception takes place.
Our hotel is located in the head of the city - one of the four largest hotels in the city - is one of the most popular reporters of Mexican television.
The most valuable dividend
The world's most famous place in Paris is for a divorcée, and among the living divorcées today, Valentino is the most quifinomous and the least doubt.
Mango recently hosted the second bid of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, aimed at international recognition of its young capabilities.
The main is EUR 300,000.
Last night, Sandrina Fasoli, the first Belgian winner of the first bid, saw his own design clothes in the Paris Boulevard Haussmann under 54, and made it easy for him to do so.
Accordingly, this company opened the second largest European business and recently opened it in 1335.
The largest business is located in London.
We finally found ourselves in the Paris Garnier Opera in the middle of the thank you for the events and for Valentino, which are due to the chairmanship of the army.
The presidential table prepared by Mango is still more visible in Chagalo's most popular society.
Nati, who recently died of his brother's death with a heart and grief, conducted one of the Cég's funerals and some of the survivors of the ELAH. With his son, Luis, he was about two meters tall, trying Valentino to celebrate the dinner he had arranged for.
And then, the owner of Mango and the owner of the house made the guests laugh, and with the Rotchil bar, they were so wild that they were finally left without clothing because they both offered it to one lady.
Monica Cruz came to the business on her own, and at night she wore a long black dress. During the night's operation, she joined Gaya Toledo's company in the bathroom, hoping that the old days would be spent on one side of the street and a big party.
Inês Sastre didn't participate in the palatial tour, but he showed some photos of his mobile.
The next day, we arrived at Oliver Martinez - he will be walking two meters high and motorized - and John Travolta arrived at the Paris Intercontinent Hotel. He also brought his own boots and boots, and he said good-bye to the room that he did not ask for any rest.
The stars of Paris under the stars.
Oh, that's life.
1001, stressed number
Not 1000, but 1000 and one way to get rid of catholic and ironic signs.
It is also good news that we can find everything in one book, which comes to my library on September 30, to bring my peace with you.
It's about 7 o'clock in the morning, but it's even worse to think about how exciting life is for today's world.
The office's name is a fraud, and his computer's back.
Stress is the population of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two ways to deal with day-to-day unemployment and work-related problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In the long position, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution that is the most convenient and free of charge.
The stressing tool takes the title of 1001 relaxation method and the cost-effectiveness from the Pearson Alhambra y DK expenditure comes to the library boxes.
If you are convinced that your job or personal relationships can at least relieve stress, this manual will certainly be free of all anxiety.
In fact, you are also serving with other ideas that help all-inclusive, for example, tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% of natural food.
If the adrenaline is too low to refresh the body and become a central problem of stress life, it is time to get back to the follicle, relax and concentrate only on reading.
They're talking in dreams
Some kids talk tonight.
I don't think about those who wake up and totally excited about what happened to them that day, but about those who speak in bed.
First of all, it may look like a traitor, but actually, it's completely harmless.
It's called sleepniloquismus.
Very often, mainly around children and adolescents.
I'm sure most of them were told that he spoke last night.
It can be completely severe (e.g. once in a high leg disease) or more frequent (days, weeks or months once) and usually the child does not remember anything the other day.
You can't drive back to only one choice.
Other sleeping arrangements, such as sleeping arrangements, night shifts, night sleeping arrangements (enuresis nocturna) or sleep arrangements, but this is not legal.
As we have already mentioned, a high-speed condition, or even a stress site or a high-pressure condition, may also be an inexplicable condition.
There's been a little study in all of this.
The intensity of the speech is very different.
It may be mild, calm, or may be accompanied by consensual words, tingling, but in contrast with all of this, it may be expected that it is in the form of a search, a cry, or longer speech.
If the significance is very intense, it is recommended to look after the child and the child. The test can determine whether there is a problem behind the back and can also provide a solution.
As we have already mentioned, there is no cure for improvement unless it is combined with any other treatment (e.g. sleeplessness or stress).
However, there are some things we can do, and then a measure ahead of time:
Let's listen to the child stay calm before he falls asleep.
Let's choose fun games and let's get rid of children looking at scary or aggressive television series or series.
We teach children who are tired or depressed to find inner peace easier.
This will help the child to sleep in a quieter sleep.
If he starts talking during sleep, we'll try to keep our peace.
Don't worry, this is harmless for kids, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Practical advice
Don't wake up the kids.
It would be ridiculous, because the kid doesn't know, but he's gonna get out of bed.
Despite what he's saying, he's actually sleeping and sleeping.
Do not overlook the fact that multiple times a severe pregnancy tries to turn or determine what makes a major pregnancy from children.
If you are able to speak (this is the rarest case), do not start asking him to know anything about it.
It would be so quiet, since during sleep you don't know how to put all your thoughts in perspective.
On the other hand, you just listen to your talk, but you don't see the pictures accompanying it, so be careful with the understanding of the audience and the possible consequences.
Never tell kids who can ask about the secrets at night.
It's not funny yet.
This has become a very big mess.
So the most important thing is that they don't worry, because it's just a few minutes about an innocent episode.
Finally, at the same time in Illhaeuser
After a long period of meditation, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new birth and won a new victory at home.
Although it wasn't a ferret match, the scargs were made into a situation several times that they could finally win one.
It was not too hard for the attackers to feel the right rhythm.
The first capra was shot by the captain of the guest team, Kaufmann, but the remote lab was just interested in the upper arm of the cap. Then Illhaeusern was put on the side and followed by the pilots: Funderflick tried with a remote shot, then Hirn was sent to the head. Roman spy, and Dibold, at the same time, tried to secure Dannemarie's protection.
On the other hand, the players were protected in a block in the middle, and only in the spring of the giant Rihai.
The crucial importance of the second half of the year has been achieved: first, Rihai and Temporale took place on the Dannemarie side. Then he was born on the first floor: after the first blast of Diebold, he acquired a piece of paper from the place of the ill-treatment of Marais, and then brought it into the capu into the hat (53 p.m.).
However, Illausern’s poet was not able to enjoy the beauty for a long time: it was not easy to leave his palace 12 minutes later, so his team members had to continue fighting in human rights.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to take advantage of it: there was not much concern for the home teams who were just a few steps behind to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds kept some surprise when after a great deal of contact, the lambda was very close to the capafá.
Sarkozy meets the hot fish
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes an exit to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration by the sea was delayed by several bridges and normal exits, so the president of the public decided to make a visit to the port of Finistère-beli Le Guilvinec to meet with the representatives of the trainees.
The latter promised to accept the President in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their absolute hope, according to Sarkozy's "specific proposals".
The president's visit is currently in line with the meeting of the Committee of the Regions, which was set up in the evening with a view to starting action at the increase in gas prices, as the oil exceeded the average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martin, the president of the president of the public, said that the president "will discuss with the fish what solutions could help companies to recover their competitiveness, or make it safer for seafarers to work and catch".
The fish are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive.
Two mornings in Morbihan and Calvados were held in other commercial exhibitions, with which they were conducting nearly 10 km of drills.
They also ordered the shipment of Quiberon's yachter, but they didn't close the roads leading to Belle.
They've replaced the islands of the Middle-Cuberon.
On the weekend, the seamen had already given evidence of their failures. Then, in vain, they had to put up rubber bunkers and rakes in front of the brake exits, while the arrests were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
These further movements were followed by the Atlantic and La Manche ports. Vendée's harbors in Sables d'Olonne, for example, were not transported to a ship while in Le Havre, as a ship, stopped the trade of commercial ships.
The La Turballe and Le Croisic fishing in Loire-Atlantique, which is located elsewhere, destroyed the powerful total oil-finoming block operating in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer fishing vessels, however, decided to wait for the evening session in the Ministry by decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the same "statement committee" must decide on the next step and participation in the meeting planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some vessels would not want to fish if they were to represent the interests of the National Fisheries Commission, as the Commission did not support their operations.
"Strateks continue," because "the fish are not allowed to travel to Paris" and "not to travel to Paris," for example, said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The official fisheries that do not pay taxes after the gas oil are currently about 50 cents for the litre, but they think that the operation of a ship would only become a source if the gas price would be reduced by EUR 0,30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance boys are in the connetique home, 83 years of age, after cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also taught respect for the 83-year-old film and office of Paul Newman.
Embraer did not change the 2008 transport plan
In spite of the global economic crisis, the Brazilian airline plans to launch 215 aircraft this year.
The world's fourth largest airline company, Embraer can maintain the plans and plans to install 215 aircraft in 2008 - strengthened Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company's president.
In the first case, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company is a major producer for the Chinese market, particularly in relation to 30-120 man-made aircraft.
The Embraer has already spent eight years in the service of all 41 Chinese agents.
More than 15 % of the AIG instruments
The American International Group, established by the Financial Authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to pay back the amount of $85 billion that was allocated to the share - it is announced that the Financial Times domain is being issued.
In addition to the international level of life insurance and pension insurance activities, the AIG level has changed from a large part of all other business - the news that led to the near-the-case resources of the case.
According to Times, the AIG Board of Directors was sitting on Thursday night to examine the sales possibilities.
The AIG has not strengthened this information.
The AIG will own its own instrument to be sold by the company's International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance company, and its own portfolio and personal audits - it will add the Times.
According to the news, however, there is still no final decision on the sale.
The AIG should quickly be able to reimburse the $85 billion loan approved by the US government, thus risking the loss of even 80% of its capital and its shares accordingly.
Paris Historique's study of the morning Meeting on the historic meeting of Morning Meeting
New York's historic return was announced in the week after the signature restored Paulson's banknote plan. The Dow Jones index was 6.98% returned (which was never seen, about 800 points down), and Nasdaq was 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) is 777.68 points so 10 365.45 points closed.
The largest return of the index (point 684.81) was registered on 17 September 2001 when the trade was renewed following the September 11 terrorist attack.
Nasdaq 199,61 with a return point of 1 983,73 points while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 increased index by 8.81% (as at 106.85 points) decreased by 1 106.55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street bank has already failed to open, and when the Senate suddenly reopened the bank plan to restore the market balance, it began to reassess.
In spite of 228 "no" votes, 205 "yes" were returned to the resources requested by the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson.
The plan was signed by the Republicans almost two times.
"This is why the market has dropped a bad sign because Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial Analyst.
"It also shows how much the market has been counted on this plan," he added, and he expressed concern about the fact that if a few days later they would adopt such a plan, it would already be "again".
"If the plan is really dead (...), then Fed (the US Central Bank) and the other central banks will have the chance to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will continue to increase" - warning Brian Bethune, Global Insight Director.
The sense of urgency continues to increase: "Every day you go to a new and more financial institution" in the United States.
After the Washington Mutual Five-pound, the authorities made arrangements to buy the Wachovia bank business in the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis quickly emerged, which required urgent measures to save banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux in the states of Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market "not only American but a global crisis" is contributing to the FTN Financial Survey.
The chain market has been significantly damaged.
The 10-year-old rate of State aid decreased by 3,827% in the evening by 3,632% and returned by 4,357% on the previous day to 4,161% by 30 years.
Obama won the first television pair
Two American presidential Friday, his first question was a new one, who had to pretend that John McCain or Barack Obama was winning the match.
Not surprisingly, the responsible representatives of the Republican and the democratic campaign told each other about the victory in the television fairs, which I noticed for one third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, even though John McCain's action was worthy of respect, he has not yet proved to be "simply" enough to stop the decline in popularity: this is evidence of five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, democracy has been better identified in the fight: Obama's publicized results show that it is in the interest of McCainn (44% or 49%).
According to the most determined, 39% of the respondents will win as long as 25% of McCain's win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to increase the benefit of his partner, Joseph Biden's great-grandfather. He is prepared for the first and only public contest, with Sarah Palin.
However, Bill Clinton warned at the end of the week: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
They have a good sense."
McCain, who lives in the last century, never hesitates to put his own, unbiased foreign political experience before him; nevertheless, he stresses the "novation" of these issues that were among the first personal encounters.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." heard the attack several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the president's position," McCain said.
This is the main attack site that has been used since yesterday by republican TV broadcasts.
But Obama put his voice to the point that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be disturbed: he was completely and precisely occupied.
He stressed the ability to make good decisions and to restore a picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama has already done" - he wanted a democratic announcement that last week, which led to the person of the Republican leader, that he still didn't measure the impact of the crisis on the American "foreign people".
"The debate lasted for nine minutes, John McCaininek had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama before a meatman who gathered in the cold summer of North Carolina for the election meeting.
He did not even utter the words "relative" or "employers" in his mouth. In the financial world, he certainly liked Obama, who the Americans are the most useful to save the economy that is at stake.
"The next week can prove a turning point," said Charles Schumer, the influential democratic senator yesterday.
Ram Emanuel, a representative of democracy, is one of the presidents of the Clinton government, Obama "with excellent incentives in the field of economy" like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In a democratic president, the current crisis is "the final judgment against the eight-year-old bad economy policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinoian Senator reaffirmed that despite the nuclear power supply, the US will be able to reduce the burden of 95%, and added that, among its main objectives, the creation of the country's potential energy dependence by using renewable energy resources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain, however, plans to create 45 atoms by 2030.
However, both presidents were careful about the issues relating to a bank plan of $700 billion (EUR 470 billion), which was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk, "Did you notice that there was a choice?"
On Friday evening, boys and girls were shot in the capital of the Black City in order to avoid the expected outcome of parliamentary elections.
On Friday evening, following the closing of voting positions, several hundred white people gathered in the capital of Minsk to protest against the loss of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young President Alexandra Lukasenko has been protested against the following words: "Mr. Diktátor, tell me!".
Some say they haven't gone to vote yet, "What would I have done? So they do what they want to do with my vote!" - a young man says.
The observers do not believe that the race, which was well-known in the eyes of foreign observers, for the purpose of establishing a European Union, would be prepared for a democratic system.
If the election were to be cleared by the observers, the country could be subject to tax sanctions, which included 40 white leaders and some bank accounts.
According to the opposition, however, the elections did not have to be kept clean.
"We were also held by election committees, and our observers could not participate in the vote account" - accused Jury Potyemkin, organized by the twelve parties, so heterogeneously the Head of the United Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were just names" - Alekssandr Milinkievic, the 2006 presidential election protest and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who calculates the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the opposition were sent into Parliament, it means they were appointed, and they were not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament allows them to get a place on television, to sit in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore be drawn into political life because "you must start a dialogue with the European Union".
Similarly, if we face a serious economic crisis in Russia and we are not able to renew it, we are at risk of being under the control of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition maintains that the European Security and Cooperation Service, which takes note of the election process, accepts the outcome of the vote.
It is stressed that the rate of participation appears to be too high and that the organisation of the previous vote (as part of the 26% of the electoral population in Minsk) has made it possible for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that the election was delayed?" - asks the question of the leader of Social Democrat Alekssandr Kozulin, who was released last August with the second of this year from prison, where they held political office.
No one has been held in voting positions.
There will be no more than five opposition representatives in Parliament, even those who are more obedient to the leadership.
In October, the night is falling again.
On television, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee will succeed.
The blood is again safe.
Hema-Québec's 13th anniversary of the celebration last night. Dr. Francine Décary's President was well-informed at the meeting, as Hema-Québec has become one of the most secure and affordable blood companies in the world.
And most importantly, it has succeeded in restoring people's confidence, which has seriously increased the impact of blood clotting in the 1980s and 1990s.
As a well-known official, the Canadian Red Cross has been infected with the developed immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
After the drama and the general appeal, the Government of Canada launched a formal investigation with the leadership of Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, with the aim of determining the light on what circumstances led to the tragedy and preparing proposals for the prevention of similar future events.
While presenting the report of the Court of Justice, Krever has set up a committee of its own, which aims to plan a new system of administration for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Commission has taken over this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports have produced two blood transfusion services in Canada: one is Hema-Québec, who serves Québec, and the other is responsible for all other ingredients and two territories.
"When Hema-Québec started its activity in 1998, people had almost 38% confidence in Québec's bleeding system," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was a mystery.
"In the coming years, however, the improvement of the safety of blood products and our work in the area have been successful in restoring people's confidence." Décary is proud to say that in early 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population was already dependent on Héma-Québece.
However, Dr. Décary is not surprised by the fact that "trust is a rare thing."
The precautionary principle has been applied since the establishment of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998.
A number of cases have been reported in Europe during this period when the elderly, namely the new variants of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, have also affected people - for example a doctor who has been guiding the society since its establishment in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, the Krever and Gelineau reports are one of the most important recommendations. According to the fact that there is a risk of serious illness, we need to take immediate measures. In the present case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob was a disease that causes the change of life, so that it is inevitable to die.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And for a few years, it has been established that all doubt is that you are going through the blood of the disease.
This has confirmed us that we have understood the principle of caution."
In 1999, the market identified a technique that makes HIV-virus more sensitive to diagnosis. It is a nuclear test (NAT) that is directly capable of presenting the virus in the blood of the blood, and not the anti-virus tests for which previously used tests.
With the help of the NAT test, we can extend the abbreviation period that remains from the infection until we can show the patient with the help of our technical tools.
This period was reduced to less than a week.
It was thus significantly measured the risk of blood transfusions outside the medical field and that this could not be demonstrated.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
In our day, the risk of someone infected with HIV is 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should release 12 million blood products while someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400-500 haemorrhages each year, it should take more than 24 years to complete such an event and someone will be infected with HIV through a blood transfusion.
I think that today anyone can accept blood transfusion in a calm manner or write a blood transfusion to restore health - hema-Québec's first number leader.
"The challenge of your next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We don't know what a new cracker is going on in the system.
Because only last year did it happen that the chikungunya virus, which is similar to the Nukugat-Nilus virus, appeared on the island of Réunion.
That's why we have to be part of it all the time." - Dr. Décary continued, and then he stressed that he should take care of the permanent contents of Hema-Québec outside the shelters.
"The needs of the people are growing with age.
As cancer - free treatment has become more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or blood vessels.
The population's age is also affected by the state of the blood vessels, since the number of people suitable for blood on the network is only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, any person who is at least 18 years of age may give blood for every 56 days, or six times a year.
Not more than 14% of the respondents are not receiving blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed have not been eligible for blood for a year.
"With this 3 percent we have so much content that we can satisfy the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to be able to get away from the preparations.
However, we need to increase the number of blood vessels in terms of age, because they can no longer donate blood after a while.
But it's very difficult to convince people that they're giving blood, but it's even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In this troubled world today, it is easy for a person to go out of his way to give up his own blood" - Francine Décary laments.
Hema-Québec, a 297 million-year-old budget, not only provides blood products, but also human tissues, such as heart transplants, heartburns, eyebrows, and skin rashes, which are used only in case of severely impaired people.
These texts are analyzed, revised and used, and then replaced with Hema-Québec, which is also managed by the only public bank in Quebec.
The skin is treated as a medical waste from a blood clot that is rich in cells, thus allowing for the treatment of severe diseases (e.g. leukaemia).
"We celebrated a few weeks ago that our bank had entered the second time, and this year we planned for more than a hundred new models.
At the beginning of the next year, we are probably starting to accept these organisations" – Dr. Décary, who said that the nature of the translucent television program is very popular.
"My mother is sad that there is no chance of this" - in fact, this is because hema-Québec is not able to make this complex and cost-effective program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Abbreviation - In favour of the Impact
The Montreal Impact team signed at 3:1 yesterday on the Seattle Sounderst at the SSL-1 player, and the total 4:3 results were included in the preview. This was the fourth-hand and most important event in terms of content, which was held at the Saputo Stadium.
The decision-making goal of Antonio Ribeiro was reached at 90 minutes of the contest.
While without the first half, the second middle of the visual team, David Testo and Rocco Plantentino were found in the enemy network.
Only Roger Levesque from the Sounders team succeeded in delivering Matt Jordan from the team.
Recall that in the first five years of the contest, the impact of Impact 2:1 was suffered in the town of Starfire Complex from Tuquila, Seattle.
The impact is playing with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which was first released from Whitecaps, won at 4:3 but still won the Whitecaps with a total of 5:4.
The Impact can be seen on Friday and Friday with Whitecaps, but the details of the tests are still being clarified today.
In Dióhej - Kovalev’s winning goal
The Canadian favorite triad is waiting for the new season.
Alex Kovalev, Thomas Pkelanec and Andrei Kostitsyn launched three major attacks and finally won the Canadiens against Florida Panthers at 3:2 a.m. in the center of Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the first number star in the meeting was bought with a gift. Pakanec two, Kovalev closed the contest with a total of six preparations, which was my fourth victory.
The contest was decided by Kovalev, who received the only floor of the contest.
"I'm not ready" - warning the Russian player.
"I need another game to really feel myself."
"He tried too much to get out of you in the first three," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy for the end of the game.
He's got a great ovulation."
Charest Northern Islands
The governor doesn't want the election to begin this year.
At the end of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest had already traveled to the Quebeci Jean-Tallon, where the new Health Minister, Yves Bolduc (lowered) gave me a victory in the current interim election.
"The last major north-east destinations": this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Charest at the quebeci Liberélis Part Lévis on Saturday. The talk was also enriched with visual elements, while the president urged him to concentrate on the matter.
During the presentation, similar images were taken from behind the back of the "Moulin an image".
The three huge exhibits followed each other: watercraft crafts, mining, Québec in the Google Maps, maps...
Such visible instruments were commonly introduced in electoral periods.
On the other hand, the government has not been able to guarantee that the election will not begin this year, although it has contributed to the fact that time is very serious.
The fourth pillar is the vision of the government's future in Quebec, which is made up of a "new economic area" which is linked to France's employment agreement, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and more, with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening of the North (that is, the northern part of the 49th century) has often taken place in government talks, but has not yet taken place on this subject.
However, the Head of State has simply explained why he also holds East "a very valuable asset of a great opportunity". However, he did not talk about the period, the investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
It has only increased some development opportunities: firstly, water, forestry and, in particular, pollution, which continues to sustain the growth of developing countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
And it's found in "with snow, cink, rain, platinum, orange, blue, white, black, titan and even gay" - said Charest.
It's the area that "two times as much as France" "as our territory, Quebec.
Not only are we, but we are". - The Head of State has repeatedly stressed that he wants to create a national-based myth.
He noted that Québec's development has greatly defined the relationship between the North: the Abitibian, the Queen's designer, the James...
"This is ours, our future!" - he made it to him, after he had a picture of the horrors behind his back.
In the region of Quebec, 70% of the North is also part of Labrador, who has always been following you - the head of government has informed the media.
"This is our historical record, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a borderline that has no consent for a long time and if I sometimes tax it, I reaffirm the same statute on behalf of the government."
On the other hand, in the context of climate change, we need to rethink our views on the Middle East," declared the Head of State on the northern transition that opens up every year after the reading of the Iraqi ice.
According to the Government's opinion, in this new geopolitical environment, the area is an important responsibility.
And what about the land's roots, the Indians and the tools?
The Head of Government announced that the government of Quebec would pay particular attention to them, and many will benefit from the plan, especially for young people.
Two ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (later sent by the party Québecois ungua) have already begun the agreement with the local community about three times.
It also began its operation by the Ministerial Committee of Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister responsible for transportation and natural resources) played an important role.
The head of government does not close the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily cutting-off" where they create a common water.
In other words, the development of the North would be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan has been agreed, incorporated into the system and will be in the same environment" - the Head of Government has promised.
Jean Charest wrote this "viso" in a way that is consistent with the pictures of the former liberal ministers.
"Like the former liberals, we think otherwise: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges."
On the other hand, this was one of the refurbished theme of the weekend that began with the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election.
One of the decisions taken suggests that Beauharnois's power be passed through the Adélard-Godbout bridge.
"We are political parties, including Godbout based on Hydro-Québece, the Lésage that ensures the national distribution of water instruments, or Bourassa, well-known as his father, was all-knowing about how the future should go," said Jean Charest.
The information was presented by another true, conservative work, and by John Diefenbaker, Ministerial Programme, "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
In connection with the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper Water Station, President Charest stated that it is planning to operate for 2012.
"Don't stay with us, but I plan to be there," she said her phone call, and she accepted her statement with a loud voice.
The same Minister, who said in April that there will be no elections in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not close the possibility of a vote that would be valid for a year, which also makes the law possible.
He stressed, however, that the agenda is now full, as he was responsible for the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and the Québec-New York.
The summit held at the end of the week was an excellent platform for the Liberal President for the preparation of nationalist decisions which had been adopted without any consideration.
I would also like to refer to Québec as members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, which would be available to the members in relation to the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, however, took over the main points of the North Plan.
The leader of the Party of Québecois, Paulina Marois, reopened the North-Quebec Development Policy, which was launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in force in 2003 reiterated its application of this policy.
If it hadn't been done, "we're already much ahead," she thought in agreement with Mrs Marois Françoise Mercure, who was introduced by today's Jean-Talon vote.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the North Plan.
"But we would like it if it wasn't an empty color," noted the partner Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, Minister of Harper's Cabinet (also the Minister of Justice), took the courage to call Louise Arbourt of Canada "the Minister of Justice".
This is how to treat a woman who has fought for the truth without injustice and deserves all our wonders - this is very much different from the people around the Minister and himself about Stephen Harper.
So this is our government, which has not delivered its own country from the Guantánamo concentration camp in one of the countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when he was accused of his crimes.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, has adopted its word and has allowed it to be seen as a child in an unreceptive environment.
The only government that does a baby house from justice while examining a charged crime.
Let's just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian Lawyers' Association also demand Omar Khadr's return to Canada to participate in a decent process.
And our government is losing its eyes on torture: it doesn't count on a young adult to be completely ruined now, and the many years of persecution have probably ended his race in a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, now our rights, freedom and democracy are being destroyed. "Demokracia": Harper is not ashamed to hear this word that sounds like a simple word from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more trouble: they can willingly fight, rape and rape any Canadian government official, according to the ease of a government leader who was so young (and what will come after October 14th...?).
Many voters believe that the community can be found on a party that celebrates Erény, the Council and the Order. They do not see that this government leg forms the values that our countries can have due to the good news and dignity.
Mr. Toews, you'd rather not look elsewhere.
Review - Barrick Gold Orwelli Bed & Breakfast
A letter dated 17 September from Patrick J. Garver, vice president of the Canadian President Barrick Gold, was issued by Le Devor.
As the capital of Orwelli, Garver declares that the world's largest gold-producing company is six million dollars of gold-derived mining per cent for the launch of a so-called "public dispute".
Although the courts are independent and impartial, their decision - especially in the courts - is not the truth but the rule of law.
It's not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Would Barrick Gold really be the best way of public debate to destroy anyone who is opposed to his position?
Regardless of the issue, the authors and publishers of the book called Noir Canada should spend significant amounts to protect and fight in an uneven war, where on the other hand there is a number of lawyers who have been supported by undeprived resources at the level of payroll.
On the other hand, in such an unequal fight, the tactics are often used to undermine tender and friendly relations that not only listen to opposers but also fear those who try to rethink the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public issue, he would have had to make his views known before the statement.
It may be good in a number of other countries where Barrick Gold continues to operate, this is happening differently, not usually in Canada, but in Canada, where the parties are talking about their thoughts.
It would therefore have been sufficient to open his books and records and to prepare for the real vitarium in a press, media, and publications, with the payment of independent research groups that could have shed light on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust the address, and with a motion, he wrote questions and letters in the protection of the Noir Canada authors.
Mr. Garver might explain how he could begin the "public" issue if he was not taking into account this public opinion?
In the head of the presidential board, this is probably just the case of the defendants paid by the bus, and not Canada's complicity: the report of the arrest is so well received.
In a democratic state, it is also against freedom of speech for others.
The Barrick Gold, however, does not mean - or does not want to understand - that the Noir Canada's authors and publishers are primarily supporting the public because it exposes the harsh treatment of the poor.
The public opinion is ready to hear the Barrick and the judgment, but on the basis of these civilized opinions, it would not be for a lot of people to listen to more. (The "public debate" expression was written in a recent letter to the Noir Canada authors to keep this expression from using it.)
Garver has taken an open attack against the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which is the foundation of all democratic societies.
Throughout the procedure, it adopts the right to conduct credible sources, to argue about the facts and their interpretations, which constitute the basis of spiritual activities.
If a similar country in Canada is able to study and discuss subjects that do not like the world's economy today, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent issue, this could be done according to scientific standards applied by Noir Canada's authors.
He has the right to answer.
We have been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts in our university environment for a long time.
Barrick Gold's unexplained procedure well shows that he did not want to continue with anything that was open to him.
This is a loss for both the university's world and the Canadian public prosecutor's institution. This is the time when governments will put in place measures that limit legal procedures initiated with the aim of bringing about such a return.
Wall Street Hospital - Democrats and Republicans
The Bush government and the Congress's Republican and Democratic leaders finally agreed on the economic healing, which has been the biggest plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The US $700 billion plan, which aims to tackle the financial crisis that has plagued the Wall Street months ago, still needs to be approved for the two Houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective verification of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the return of the proposed state funds; new provisions for the maintenance of the number of houses occupied due to the absence of payments; and the right to review the payment of the directors of the companies involved in the aid.
Henry Paulson, American Finance Minister, Nancy Pelosi, president of the American Parliamentary House and Judd Gregg, who participated in the negotiations, reported the good news a few minutes before the end of the two-day marathon negotiations.
"We have made great progress on a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush government.
"We have done everything to save the economy and American citizens from the current Wall Street crisis," the democratic representative explained.
"The most important thing is that if we don't do this, it'll be terrible for the lot, the chaos and the heat in the American everyday life," said the Republican representative Judd Gregg.
The discussion was forced in the last few hours to fear that a new fraud would have a harmful effect on investors’ reputation.
The agreement has been given to you until the opening of this morning.
Two presidents who have recently joined the negotiations are ready to agree, however, are not pleased that the situation has finally improved.
Senator Barack Obama has granted you an extension of the agreement to such matters as the maintenance of your property or the payment of payments by the Heads of State.
"When we ask tax collectors to take certain extraordinary steps because of the lack of responsibility of other people, it is not too exciting.
But these steps are necessary," he noted in an American television artist.
And when John McCaint was against, he asked about another mess, whether he would vote for the proposed plan, he answered, "I want to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I've read in large lines, it's already evident that there's something we all need to learn about, and that we can continue to get through it.
The opportunity to do nothing, simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy from money the double requirements of the U.S. financial institutions, which were considered to be a risk-free instrument.
The plan was launched in a 14-month-old crisis that led to the expulsion of property. This first led to the accumulation of risk-based property (remarks) and then to other credit-recognitionable (commercial) securities, and finally to the collapse of liquid resources and the release of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican representatives signed the first agreement last week.
It seems that we have succeeded in this prison since the Democrats agreed that certain "sounding" tools of companies in a difficult situation would be more likely to guarantee the government than they would buy.
In order to ensure that all members of the Congress are satisfied, there is also a provision in the plan which provides that if the government has to carry out losses within the framework of the programme for five years, new taxes may be paid for the return of its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion would first be paid; this could be followed by another 100 billion if the president is required.
The amount of $350 billion to be paid by Congress should be approved by a new vote.
In the case of aid, Washington has a share in supported companies through which the benefit is shared and which can be sold after the crisis has passed.
It will be possible for the Federal Government to prepare the inventory of the property to be covered by the notes in the plan, thereby reducing the maximum value for the management of the companies concerned by the crisis.
I would like the designer of the plan if the plan was to be concluded today by the representative and the senator.
Despite their efforts, however, they are still not sure that the plan will be approved.
On the same day all the republicans and all the Democrats agreed against the plan again.
"It is quite clear that Washington does not hear your voice," said the president of the Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the Financial Committee of the House.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one who likes tax collectors."
Brad Sherman, the "skeptic groups" of a small congressional group, shows things differently, but this is the same conclusion.
"Six hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize-winners, wrote to us to ask Congress: don't worry, and examine thoroughly which way you choose." Sherman said last night.
In Europe it was once again understood that there is a global crisis here.
Following a crisis assessment, the three Benelux states that the Fortis Bank Group is a part of a group of Euro 11.2 billion (16.3 billion United States dollars).
The involvement of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary after the French BNP Paribas has notified, not to buy a competitive market on the market, after losing 2 million euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the United States due to the crisis.
Fortis is one of the largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"This money didn't come out," declared Wouter Bos Dutch Minister of Finance yesterday.
"We have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly the thing that is now highly valued by nurses and households, that the situation is becoming uncertain."
In the middle of La Manche, the British government seems to be ready to set up a new bank that is facing the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would replace the total of the loans in the Bradford and Bringley bank process, from which the property is made up of 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion dollars).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they would buy the British bank's assets and assets.
The Bradford and Bringley with this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British government has been trying to establish since the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Sorry about the music service
It was one of the most beautiful sights in the world, and another of the most difficult.
Has he ever been released from the naked picture of the cute American mossy color?
Yeah, and not.
Through his sensitivity, sensitivity, and excellence, he stood out of the same style as the creation of the great monsters of art.
But what a great fight he's been in!
At 83 years of age, Paul Newman died in a cave in the city of Connecticut, where he was one of the last icons of the American music flower.
There was less monumental unity than Brandon, who was compared to him, and who had long been counted as a traveling overseer in the film shop. In his role, he was more and more likely to be a cause for doubt, but he also refused to break the freedom and the drama conventions.
Blood clotting is often caused by children who are more likely to develop.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as the mother of a Jewish father and Hungarian birth.
European ancestors have contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which only increased his interests.
In the early 1950s, Yale studied the "self-made man" film and the battle of the Pacific Ocean. In the early 1950s, Yale studied at the New York Actor's Studio, before becoming a hero in the cinema, television and not much later in the music world.
In addition to the existence of civil rights, in 1979 it was the second place in Le Mans. In addition, it was held as a sex symbol, it may have been good for Joanne Woodward, who lived in a happy marriage since 1958.
Now we can never know what kind of treasure was there for this secret, closed, life of color that hated the show-business star. It's still hidden for all of us.
He was a real man, in the greatest sense of the word.
At the end of the week, Paul Newman killed a lot of motionists: we can see only in large parts of the memory of black people.
In the course of life, we have completed the seventh American art, which has lasted for more than five years with constant changes in music.
We remember the young man who was raised by "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boys" with a lovely cowboy (1969) and a sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor) who was a member of the "Macska on the Fortler" in 1958.
From recent times (1990), we can recall in a picture of the feeling Mr. Bridge, who, in his old age, had not changed his marriage’s expectations.
We've seen a lot of other faces in Paul Newman's movies.
In a film called "Valakiyat down", Robert Wise offered an unforgettable production in the role of a live criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano. This was originally for James Dean - who was transferred to Newman after his death - in 1956.
He also played a sympathical criminal in a British act called "The Great White", which was introduced in 1973 to the best film of Oscart.
Robert Rossen, in his Spanish film "The Swindler" (1961), made a huge billiard, and in a similar way returned to Martin Scorese's "The Money Color" film. He received one of the nine signs of Oscar in 1987.
It's different times, but it's always the same face: it was him.
It was always like that.
The change in the time of its adoption marked a change in time.
Young people especially know George Roy Hill from the "Cultures" film (1977), where Reggie Dunlopot makes a team of non-conformists.
The region was also seen in the "The Great War" by Coen-Fours in 1994.
Sam Mendes closed his film called "The Path of Pain" in 2003: it last appeared in the role of a written mafia.
In contrast to a lot of motion pictures that have recently left the movie shop, Newman has been in a long-term reflectorphine, he may well have shared Hollywood with his starring, lighting and visualizing.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, didn't think of him without all the noise as "the life-sustaining football": he thought his game was too strong.
However, the course was not always the best with Paul Newman, who for a long time had just been involved in filming.
Even more recent, young and successful characters: more than the society’s worst - living disease, alcoholism, mistrust, or despair - produced images that were able to restore them to perfect confidence.
As an organizer, Newman showed a little familiar face: a truly compassionate and sensitive person in the soul.
In 1968, in the film "Rachel, Rachel" with his wife, Margaret Laurence, a Canadian writer, Joanne Woodward, placed a beautiful portrait of a melancholy woman.
The film "Harry and Son" prepared in 1984 and a film about repressive and sadism, and his son, Scott, is remembered.
Last night, Newman remembered his countless admirers about the dancer. His close friend and former warrior, Robert Redford (who played with "The Great Left" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Boys) declared: "The present has improved my life and the world.
Greatness and the joy of life: this was the secret of this great color vibrarating unit that we have now lost.
In addition to his career, he is pleased with his comments on civil rights, the environment, the ongoing struggle for independent film production and Hollywood's small businesses.
Many times we saw the picture mossed with mats, words, cookies and other food packages, and it was really bad, even though it was still funny at first.
However, the introduction of such sales has always been rejected as a basis for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his babies: he was committed to his business.
In his letter to five girls, he wrote the following words: "My father was always and perfectly grateful for the success of the marriage.
It was a pleasure for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to be able to complete such an amazing and magnificent American art exhibition.
He was a mythical man, everywhere.
What was produced by Zuschlag & Tsai accountant?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against Zuschlag János and his companions will begin.
Politicians and their partners are accused of, in particular, serious damages, ongoing and commercially committed marriages and other crimes - including criminal harassment.
According to the court, the proposed funds were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often proven to be inaccurate.
In total, as a whole, the government and government funds amounted to about 65 million dollars in the Royal Ballad, some in jail.
The method of the investigation was also known by the Authority that the proposed funds were received on the basis of accounts that did not have real performance, and the companies had never met the company's obligations.
According to the claim, most of the accounts were fake.
To this end, the goods were marketed in the good city market, and the environments were made up of little towns.
And what companies in the name of the account account was found, among others, in the Balaton area that Zuschlag Janos sent to Lados István.
According to his last statement, he had to look at panties and foods.
The Italian consumers were asked to account for what was then produced, among other things, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour agenda and the proposals of the Central Government.
In most of these, Lados István noted with his associate, Žóri András, who, according to our information, wrote the figures needed for the recovery of aid.
Lados was one of the little ones who saw the "learning path" there was a hospital.
According to two accounts issued by the Zuschlajek in 2003, the visitor provided food to his group of nine main groups in the Biztos Pont Union.
However, according to the company’s position, they would not have entered the guest’s place once.
Similarly, the future of Jobb - later called the Union for the Third Year - was offset by the formal and substantive mistakes of the Foundation in 2002.
There were only three rooms in the same bathroom, ten people couldn't sleep one night, and the account told us about a guest of the same toothbrush.
But in addition, the fantastic press receivers were also identified as Pigal Kft., which, according to the information given to the complainant, did not include documents on the future of Jobb and Hoppa.
The director of the company, Farkas Gührer, told hvg.hu that when he was invited to the trial and showed him accounts, he knew that he had false documents.
"Our company's name and tax is a bad place in the neighborhood."
He added: because of the formal reasons, it is not too late that hundreds of people have been accommodated, with all ten rooms that do not have such a place.
It's also said that the account is eaten while our food is out of operation for a long time.
The budget contributors did not follow the fact that the well-known Budapest travel agency only organises foreign routes, thus identifying Hungary as a service in the cash account, which was not compatible with the company's accounting practice.
In fact, as demonstrated during the investigation, the document also drew attention to the scope of travel activities for countries outside the European Union.
Among other things, the cost was charged by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in four documents published for the future by the Bestb, the same company's service is not the 25th, but 15th percent's tax is required, and the hotel's use of only machine accounts was established, but the charged account was returned.
In addition, the "suppliers" account was broken that in the case of a company they identified road traffic as an activity carried out - said through the judicial procedure - which the company did not originally pursue in investment advice.
In addition, at the same time, differences - inadequate accounting format, non-informance - arose because the United Nations is a fake account for the Third Year, the XXI.
Only in the case of Ravenna Bt or the Confederal Sporttabor, whose representatives admitted that they had been forgiven.
They did not pay attention to, for example, that under the HIB Ltd. census, they were in the period (2001) when they ate together for the Faital Város, which is why the company's accounting insurance - according to our knowledge - said he would have set out the paper.
It was clearly established
The other group of accounting providers are those who were clean by having to issue a fixed account.
The Foundation for the Kingdom of Budapest has set out an account for the United Nations for the Third Year, as well as for a quarter million for the United Nations.
The leader of the Collab Kft, according to the charge, was one of the accused, Györfi Ludovic took it to the final account.
At the same time, Zuschlajek was working with the existing Biogate Ltd., which in 2003 saw the Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Cross as well as the accounts for which there was no real economic activity.
No payment, because the accounts have been reimbursed, but these organisations have already forgotten to include in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the account shall be those that may be bound to the defendants.
Thus, it was Kubatov Ivan who was entrusted with the trust of his employer, Delta Trió Kft, who was a Buddhist, who was not found there.
The company also issued several accounts for the sale of technical instruments in October, November and December 2005 at around 18 million Forensics.
According to the investigation data, these accounts have been purchased by the small-scale Cash Investment Ltd since 14 September 2005.
This company was owned by a Romanian businessman who would have forwarded to Kubatov Ivan letters relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he apologized to Atlasz, Hoppa, and the Union for the Third Year, and to his opposition.
On the basis of the request for Kubatov Ivan, Rome was founded by the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, no company actually worked, which the accused said was the reason they didn't get a job.
The company was still benefiting from the fact that the accused court, also the company's lawyer Sainte Zsolt, had set out accounts for the companies' associations in the name of the companies: Atlass and Y-Generations.
Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade totaled 15 accounts to Kubatov for the organizations, at a value of 14.2 million.
The court found that 10 percent of the amounts shown in the accounts were recorded and that the tax had been marketed by Kubatov.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to set up fixed accounts, which were made for the Biztos Point bid.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Union submitted a proposal for the socialist party to the Tanksic Foundation (TMA) for modern Hungary.
They also won 500-500 cents, but the amounts were not translated for the purposes set out in the tender.
In order to prevent this from happening, five final accounts received from the Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These accounts were found in different cases at the Office of the Institute of Education of the Czech Republic.
In the proceedings, the defendants, as he did in the case case, are likely to be informed of the accounting procedure.
The most interesting thing could be if you were the first to be accused, Zuschlag Janos decided to improve the subject.
Eddie's testimony is not too detailed, and he promised to speak to everyone on several occasions, but he hasn't done it yet.
The question is whether it is for this purpose, after much of the damage, five million Forts have been committed with the socialists, and Zusi takes the left.
On the other hand, those who have already suffered because they have been able to cope with the circumstances, that is, they have found themselves constantly looking for help to cope with the situation in the home.
While many of the major damages and non-recoverable economic crimes can be carried out freely, or at least in our own home, they can wait for the end of the procedure against them, so that they do not have the opportunity to do so.
Psychology: Why do we get more money?
In the purchases, the buyers tend to spend more money, oversale the price.
This knowledge - and apparently illogical - has been the key to neurological-economic behaviours of New York's neurologists and publicist researchers.
According to a study in the journal Science, people don't want to stay in a kind of competition, such as buying eBay, so they pay too high prices.
The research has tried to predict the extent of this "dangerous" system with the help of pilot auctions.
One of the volunteer groups was involved in the sale of the other group, while the active areas of the pilots were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
Both games could earn money from participants, but during their auctions - the essential element of the over-extinguishing of the other party - is the striatum, a complex of which is a complex in intensive action when the game is lost.
This field plays a role in the "self-restraining" mechanism.
Therefore, researchers say that the price is taken away by avoiding the reaction of the stratatum moon.
The members of the research group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
These three groups were licensed against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product concerned and made copies of it.
Another group was promised that if they win out of the game, they'll get another $15 in cash.
However, the third group just received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in the event of the loss of the sale.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, so much so that for one of them, the loss was stressed for the Massians.
However, according to the neurologists ’ hypotheses, the members of the "result" team were also more prominent than the control group and the "female" group.
"These results cannot be ruled out by the idea of an earlier economy.
They have always only explained the benefits of winning with the joys and risks of selling.
Only neurologists have helped to overcome the opposition between these two theories so that we are now in a third interpretation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Department of Public Economics of New York.
Hepatitis: when do we get back to the doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while Hungary mentions chronic liver disease among leading causes of death.
The number of hepatitis in the hepatitis can be estimated to be 100, but only one week of treatment is required: patients do not know much about the infection.
The name of the hepatitis virus is a collection of infectious diseases caused by various viruses.
Many of their symptoms differ from those associated with diabetes and diabetes, but they differ from the patients and the diseases caused.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the corocosol: hepatitis A and E (e.g. by food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus blood and body vessels (onions, ovaries, urine).
Travellers are careful to protect against A and B virus, there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis The symptoms occur two or three weeks after the use of infected food, usually bad feeling, weakness, fatigue, fatigue, and fatigue.
After these, the skin and the eyelids of the skin become bright, the skin becomes dark, and the treatment can last for two or three weeks.
One million people died worldwide in the most serious type of cancer, hepatitis B causes liver and liver cancer.
This is the main reason it is estimated that only 12 infected patients have received treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to liver failure, and may lead to liver failure.
Most infected people also do not know about the disease, because the disease is subsisting the liver’s symptoms below, in many cases only the first symptoms occur in 20-30 years.
So it's very important for early prevention, to carry out regular screenings.
In three groups, there are more than half of these patients: people, pharmacists and tattoos have been bleeding before 1991.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is currently 200 million worldwide.
Since a routine laboratory study may already show the disease, it is important to return to home care if you notice any unknown symptoms.
In time, the disease can be treated, the virus can be removed from the organization and the cancer can be eliminated and the cancer can be eliminated.
On 30 September, he was the world's Hepatitis World, which was first organized in 2004 by organisations representing patients in the world.
It is intended to call attention to the importance of chronic liver failure, occurrence and early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God, it hurts less?
According to a recent study, the religious faith serves as a source of pain, which could even ease the death of Catholic martyrs.
The Oxford Academy of Sciences conducted an interesting experiment to investigate the effect that God’s existence has on people’s suffering, reports the British Telegraph.
The possible external investigation involved 12 Catholic calls and the same atheists, while all of them were studying a painting depicting a Holy Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to eliminate much of the pain.
It has also been shown that the Catholic people were able to activate part of the brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first research series in which scientists, philosophers and theologians, in addition to academics, are also involved in the different parts of the unit.
The study was very concerned that a scaffolding tool was strengthened to the left of the test floor, which served the electrodes.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look at two paintings, the image of the 17th century Sachz Mária and Leonardo da Vinci, by the Sassoferrato.
The researchers hoped that the view of St. Mary was one of several religious views among the speakers, while the da Vinci image was selected because they did not think too much of the other and the healing effects.
The test subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time 20 electrodes were obtained in four consecutive parts, while you were looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
The Catholics were told that during the St. Mary's vision, they felt "safe" as if they had been "sustained" and "satisfying, peaceful" them.
In view of the religious theme, 12 percent of the pain was reported as less than when they saw Leonardo's behavior before you.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who has also participated in the study, thinks that the same effect can be affected by any powerful image, even by the priests, only to find the appropriate photo.
"We should find a picture that feels very positive about it as if it were a mother or a father." said the psychologist.
Tom Wright welcomed the results of his research.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases change our personality." He added Wright.
After the great results, only the question is, if Leonardo or some of the similar caliber painting is shown to its readers, what effect would it have on their suffering rules?
Would the vision of the quality Shrimp Mary mean even better results?
You're the one you share about yourself.
On the tenth birthday, Google can say: people can find at least as much as their head on the bed; you know where they vacationed, what kind of vacation they are and what they are interested in.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main men.
However, as regards the anti-speech sceptics, they do not see the point 2.0 of the website.
Eric Schmidt recently announced to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal information about its users, and this is necessary to enable them to keep themselves for the original purpose of Google-based projects, which he heard: "We are going to put in the system all the information in the world!".
According to Google, the company's ten-year world-wide job is still the first to be able to handle all the information.
To ask what will be five years ago, Schmidt answered: "Would you like Google to answer questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what work do I really do?" - but still the software can't answer such simple questions, because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that Internet search is being made precisely by the search engine to determine which IP address they were looking for and to what site the interested parties were looking for after the search.
During the two years leading up to the Personalized Search, users can, for example, identify their own divergences, return what they have searched for, and they will generate much better personal findings for them - based on the same logic as the Recommendations, which provides us with products and services based on our previous and established preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they see what I'm doing? - they ask users who are worried about Google data monopolies.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company can be more widespread, not the crime, the fear of punishment, the freedom zone, and then the opposition on the Internet.
However, it has been confirmed that not only do all the requested expressions regulate, but also, where appropriate, they can be passed over to third parties, and in such legal cases, there is nothing to protect Internet users' personal rights.
This was perhaps the most recent example of a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information on the Community website called Orkut, which was maintained by the Pedophiles.
However, Internet users concerned about personal rights could still be released in May when the company successfully confirmed the truth in court against the FBI by the electronic law firm: Google is no longer able to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(The federal government has, however, successfully fought out like a five-year-old website and a search phrase that was obtained by a reference to the adoption of child protection legislation that was adopted years ago, but has not yet been able to obtain the search lists of individual users or a full list of sites and key lists for two months.)
It is therefore possible to oppose Google's offer: those who keep personal data from giving them, because they feel that their intimate sphere and their own identity are being corrupted by the use of Google's services and the presence of multi-enterprises who are in conservative envy against them.
At the same time, the American geek culture and its many countries, which have a huge computer range of players, activists, users of the next generation of big companies, will see the "increasing corporate" of them, instead of rinsing them into a global partnership with Microsoft for the same purpose as Windows.
This may happen because Google does not ask for a code that identifies users from Microsoft, does not ask for money, the open, free, continuously updated source code and software packages are more available, younger, cooler than the official software practice.
However, it can also be said that the geeks are experiencing exactly the face of personal rights and the very problem of the Internet, which is now one of the most commonly heard keywords in recent years, following the web 2.0.
The 2.0 website does not speak of the same thing as the collaboration, that we deliberately do research on ourselves and use the communication channels available and while they change the same size, the same thing: we show ourselves.
A medium-sized multi-Community website can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xangá, which can also be linked to other services such as Twitter or the latest.fm, and can then enter all of them into the following systems, such as FriendFed or Blip.fm, to the blog that automatically features their latest photos stored on Flickr or Picasan.
While we read about a number of examples of how a friend can easily find out: when a friend sees a photo of the common friend’s morning light, his family friend spends the night with him or he can shoot a company’s worker just because he writes his true opinion in his blog on the above: a sure, self-assessment has been completely overestimated.
Those who live online, that's what they're showing you, we can build a better foundation after the behavior of today's young people.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to break the Google monopolium, he can do (for example, he uses the Google search system, but at the same time he doesn't let pressure stop him from Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not register for reasons in the community so as not to be able to match them, Google's online applications can be transformed from the text editor to the editors and advertisements, with alternative versions that do not bind to the original servers and that do not all of us agree to the best profile that has ever been created.
The address does not wait so secretly when you show Google the whiteness of your skin.
The company is currently worth $156 billion more than the IBM ($140 billion), the Intel ($124 billion) or the Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense advertising tasks threaten the inclusion of advertising agencies, and services that are being introduced in the fast-paced era give serious attention not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
However, the critical observers also find the positive opposites of the beneficiary: for example, the above-mentioned management has completely avoided the ban on the employees after double the company's profit, the company has found it too costly to eat very much of the daily consumption of the employees, but it is also clear from the fact that Google was still in front of the Chinese government in 2006 and that in view of their agreement, the company has missed all the findings of the company which violates the good advice, or the benefits of China.
One of the internal rules of the company is that the company does not announce a new service only when it can be used, but the problems of the coming months and years can move the world to a new point: while some think that Google's book and magazine research and archiving project has measured the size of the company that the US Supreme Court should soon look at, others can build a whole health profile on us, in this same way with our previous studies, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good basis for the next generation of scis-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, the Scroogled point of the hospital, which describes the future in which a person can approach only with Google's data.
Two young men helped two Ozdi killers in the rape
Two young people were heard by the police in the case of a two-year-old murder, and the alleged suspect was helped to remove the evidence of crimes - the former chief of police chief of Borsodo said he liked.
Young people have recognized the wrong actions of their peers, and they are now being accused of criminalizing them.
Two young people, according to information from the MTI, are free to protect two girls.
Offences can also be punished with the loss of freedom of up to 5 years.
A 23-year-old local man who was suspected of murder in Ozdi was placed in a pre-trial detention.
In the past, they have been falsely accused of murdering more people than they had been.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-olds had a greater amount of 53-year-old male.
The suspect didn't want to adjust his detention, so his client went to an Ozdian airport seven times, where he ended up with him, and then with his 9-year-old boyfriend.
According to the MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, meaning that he was followed by a gun that was placed on the scene.
The police shall examine the circumstances of the use and use of the weapon.
The Versailles has made a proposal for the purchase of pears
Two hundred million euros - like five billion cseh korone - have been proposed for the purchase of a percentage of the stock package in the stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Russian worthiers, confirmed the offer that despite the fact that the Russian capital had been excavated from the new properties of the market.
That's because you're in a state-of-the-art state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to give more than 60 percent of the paper during a few months.
The E15 Economic Journal of the Czech Republic is aware of the fact that the bid by the Polish authorities represents the highest amount that is already granted by the interested parties for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.
According to the Czech tablets, the monetary value of Nasdaq's cross-border tax, the New York Stock Exchange, the London tax and the Deutsche Börse offered.
Peter Koblic, head of the pharaoh’s valuation last week, announced that one of the interested parties would be the worst new owner, and did not close that this could lead to the destruction of the pharaoh’s valuations in the future.
Price estimates are estimated at between 5 and 10 billion kroner for market experts.
According to the agreement of the parties, about 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner in the market is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with as much as 25 percent share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 13.5 percent.

The European notes in their second comments on the growing international financial crisis are already referred to as "the 11th of September".
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster - on the basis of the Roman Republic - the President was not yet able to withdraw his own party from the legislative proposal, which aims to remedy the situation in question...
Another Pearl Harbor, which was mentioned by Warren Buffett as a billionaire investor, is the second of September 11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the crime in Washington.
According to El Mundo's view, the lack of political leadership in the Netherlands has led to the spread of globalism.
A woman is at risk for the collapse of the U.S. financial system, and then the whole world will suffer.
The Bush plan was not perfect, however, by means of a Congressional vote, but the danger is that Washington does not offer political instruments to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is very much in the air - just when one of the greatest obstacles to the history of capitalism is being overcome.
The threat can no longer be ignored - show it to the Genfi Tages-Anzeiger.
Some States can still provide funds for the support funds and taxable persons can save them from the crisis.
However, if more banks are like a bunch of dominocas, neither money nor new regulations will be sufficient.
In the long run, there is a need for Member States of the European Union to put themselves in their national affairs and to focus on the monitoring of the financial markets in question.
More than 100 billion euros a week have been received - a reminder of Becky Der Standard, which states that the concerns that European taxpayers have to spend in their pockets in order to treat the crisis are much more realistic than the US.
The EU has not yet been seriously involved in the crisis, which ends as a tsunami in the old land.
The "suppliers" need not have to borrow only hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if I determined that the taxpayers would be willing to pay the money to cover the greatest damage.
The pilot imitates the flyer of the intelligent car
What would be the best way to prevent the development of technologies that are useful for avoiding addiction without following the naturalist?
For example, the corn.
In the excellent project in CEATEC in Japan, the Dongs gave strategic input to the Nissan dimensions to build up the next generation of non-smoker systems.
In cooperation with such a union, Nissan developed a BR23C-type, biotanus-car-manding system, a robotized mini-car that was fitted with the properties of the sea, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that will cost all benefits.
During the flight, every time you explore your favorite personal area, which is actually very similar to our security guards - explained in the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, the technological PR and research development market manager.
The role of the meh composed person who is able to see more than 300 people in all directions.
To break that complex eye function, the dimensions were cut to the picture of the current distance.
In a 180-inch view before the BR23C, it identifies obstacles within 2 metres, calculates the distances, and sends a signal to the side of the microprocessor, which is immediately transferred to the operation to prevent the injury.
During the second half of the period, notice of the obstacle is taken, and after the carrot moves, the direction of the wheels changed immediately to the extent necessary for the avoidance of the strike.
In any way different from the current system, this preventative approach is fully encouraging.
"If it wasn't that way, the car robot could not respond fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the Auto-Robot Project.
It needs to be answered in a positive and immediate way, as this technology is consistent with the most damaging and most destructive parts of security forces, a region within which the strike is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what one brain does to get other brains out.
This process has to be performed under a mirror.
Well, unlike the sizes, the distance cannot be guided up, down or over, only by two dimensions, and only in terms of the transversibility of the wheels.
In this way, it was used as an opportunity to move and speed up the vehicle instead of being able to move and make it available to the other memes.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators which are easier and more energy efficiency, which means that they have lived longer than the change in lithium.
According to Andoh, the recommended intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, but the ability to store even less.
Only a few incoming signs should be processed and responded to by this organisation as a second-minute period.
You don't need to protect them and react with intuitous logic based on the data of the older males, so you're using only a few dozen kilograms of memory.
You don't need a lot of ghosts or just a lot of big memories.
This is the first step towards the development of the technology for immediate exit, which can, on the basis of Nissan's assessment, enter the race production cars within ten years.
The establishment of a unit with the GPS's friendly navigation system to avoid obstacles on the road leading the vehicle to the end of the given one.
Name has also been given to the children of the orphanage.
The written change has been made to the $700 billion economic relief package law for banks to purchase their bad loans.
First of all, the amount is spent.
According to the Eastern Party's time, during the new agreements until Saturday night, Congressional leaders came to the city of Reuters with a total of $700 billion in medical packages, which had been in circulation for days.
We've made some progress. Nancy Pelosi, president of the U.S. House of Representatives, said that he's already behind the contract paper.
He rejected both the compromise on the package, and he supported Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said the outcome of the compromise was: the programme will work and will be effective, but it is also necessary for other stakeholders. It is thought that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy into a disaster.
The written change in the package was made public by the opening of the 8th week (the average European average of two hours) in the Asian markets, but there was no apparent increase in the prisons.
The programme will be held in the Senate on the first day of the week on the draft law on economic stabilisation, 2008 on the basis of the draft legislation on the law, and the proceedings will be held in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and he welcomed the news of the reconciliation in the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night, and we appreciate the great efforts of two parties to stabilize our money markets and protect our economy - reported Tony Fratto, the White House Speaker.
In contrast, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have said that $700 billion had been transferred to the purchase of one of the bad quality, credit-added securities.
In the first instance, the maximum amount of 700 billion can be assumed to be used immediately after the Congress expected to vote on the issue, which is from the Ministry of Finance, on the basis of the purchase of misdemeanoured securities, and a further $100 billion, depending on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a special body, which will also be attended by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The removal of 700 billion others depends on the recent decision of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may use combined tactics: it may once purchase bad credit, trademarks and trademark securities, or other type of “serious” credit.
In the course of the purchase auctions and can be carried out directly - the department's properties were announced.
The legislation makes it possible for the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme, where the financial transaction guarantees funds due to concern, so that companies will pay the appropriate fee for the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to meet the US financial system's urgent needs, to purchase a wide range of funds, to ensure that the system is in line with a large fund.
We can take the necessary steps to be prepared to enter the Law by signing it.
The chief banks who are in trouble and are waiting for state aid can, however, count on the government to limit their pension money - which is called a simple orange miner.
To limit payments, only in certain cases, the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if you buy the ministry under auctions, you will be paid multiples to the Syrian consignee unless you send them to the transferred bank.
When bad faiths are bought directly, the government will intervene to ensure that the leaders' money will not be disturbed.
The ability to ensure that the existing Syrian anti-dumping treaties do not change, the restriction applies only to the new ones so that they also encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the U.S. case that there will be a legislative restriction in view of the proposal by the executives - he commented on the measure on the committee responsible for financial services in the House of Representatives, the democratic party Barney Frank.
In addition, in participating banks in the programme, the State has the right to participate in the procurement, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately win in the business as the economy and with it are at the bank’s rescue level.
The legislative plan includes the fact that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress on how to restore the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
There were, of course, both sides who raised doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, that is, not protecting the taxpayers' dollars - said the California Republican representative Darrell Issa.
Ohioi's colleague, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were adopted by the same men responsible for the formation of the Wall Street.

The prices of paper production, outputs, printing operations have not changed.
We measure price increases between 0.2% and 0.9% in other processing sectors.
Prices increased by 0.3 per cent in the coal gas, gas, gas and water sector, which represented a significant force in the country's domestic sales, mainly due to the transfer of the official gas supply from July 1 onwards.
In comparison with 12 months - with domestic sales of processing sectors - prices increased in the largest oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the production of dairy products, 13.2 per cent, 11 per cent of the food, oil, tobacco production in the area of the determination was observed.
Price reduction in textiles, textiles production (2.5 percent) and the production of cotton machinery (0.3 percent) was followed in sectors.

I don't have to go to the United States in the future?
Göncz Kinga has a good chance of entering into the U.S. visa agreement on 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Chicago spoke before the local Hungarian leadership.
According to the opinion, "now everything is in good shape only depends on whether the electronic input system or control system is installed at sea".
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no admission permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register themselves before they start.
The Hungarian Diplomatic Leader is conducting negotiations in Washington.
He meets with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezza Rice, who passes through the Hungarian Government's Edomrend Central Centre for the Explanation and Discussions with Barack Obama's Democratic Party and President-General John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are with the banknote.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the government's $700 billion banker assistance package on Friday, the two large American presidential party, has a political party that follows the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Following the March negotiations between Congress and the representatives of the administration, they reported on on Friday: they signed an agreement on the banking package.
The financial package aimed at creating the Wall Street crisis and the growing credit market became the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also point out that it is more appropriate to remove the country from the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, Obama has done something to benefit from the economic question, re-examined McCain's benefit, which was obtained after the Republican Convention, with the signature of Vice-President Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed his hope on a Sunday in a detroit campaign that the Congress will soon adopt the 700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer passports he also supported.
"Now we have to act, with responsibility (...) your position, savings, entire industries, the stability of the whole economy is at risk," he said before the crowd of 35.
He didn't hesitate to mention McCain's economic ideas over time.
McCain wrote in an interview with the ABC, "We're all going to be difficult... but nothing can easily happen."
The Republican Senator announced that the proposal involved the establishment of the supervisory committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the completion of the meetings of senior executives.
Obama told CBS that McCaininek was not an important role in the alliances, but he was in contact with the ministry day after day.
On Thursday, Nancy Pelosi announced that the representative's vote would be expected to take place on the bill in the week.
Children’s Picture of the German Language
The best team is not interested, only in the table, the voters have become more enthusiastic - so Der Spiegel analyzes the poor participation of CSU in Belarus.
I'm ready for the Austrian government to prevent red-white coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online release of the Northern German press, Franz Walter, a translation of his parents in Belarus, analyzes the impact of CSU’s dramatic blood.
According to a well-known politician, CSU’s erosion had begun well before the serious Beckstein-Huber duo had taken over his office.
During the decades of Christendom’s socialists have restored Belarus - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change is the whole Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel's problem.
The bastard wasn't a total surprise for the CSU, but at the end of the summer, a process that could have been exactly ten years to prove: a state-owned hegemony has disappeared.
For ten years, in 1998, the CSU was established in 47.7 percent, first in five years under 50 percent.
This has been repeated for three years in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it is still in the so-called Stoiber era.
This is due to the subsequent modernisation carried out by the CSU in the context of its parentheses.
Sociologists have been doing this for 40 years, but they have suffered a great deal in the storm. However, there are still no consequences for the integrity of the voters of CSUs to sacularization, educational results, the inclusion of Eastern and Northern Names in the developing region of Belarus.
Modernization is accompanied by increasing opportunities and the political consequences of these events.
The best team is not interested, only in the table, the voters have become more enthusiastic, critical, self-sustained.
It is also apparent that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups have been more away from CSU; free employment, parishioners, nutritionists and upper secondary achievements.
The CSU's aid is already under 40 percent.

The Conservative Money Day entitled "Who, with whom? The partners are involved in the issues raised in the coalitions," followed by the sector's elections, with a serious internal political situation.
The SPO wants to talk to the OVP.
The SVP prohibits the introduction of SPÖ into its brains.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations, and the Greens still don't want to agree on cohesion.
The election has taken place, now all of the coalitions are gone; in the debate organized on public service television, the partners are almost allowed to look into their cards.
President Werner Faymann SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to talk to the OVP.
SPÖ also wants to show that it is entirely possible to cooperate with two parties - in certain matters and in the social partnership.
The question of co-operation with Wilhelm Molterer - with current OVP presidents, as well as with the Alkancellar, was left open to Faymann.
As he suggested, Schüssel-Molter's course was taken everywhere.
This direction is not to be repeated.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As he said, co-operation will certainly not be successful if Faymann decides to intervene in the OVP's brains.
If the party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, the party has first fully opened the party, the issues must be discussed without delay within the OVP.
Mr Haider BZÖ reopened all directions.
"To prevent red-white coalition, we're ready for government responsibility," Hayder said.
Players: You have to break the poverty, skeletal environment
In Paris today, France's home manager, representing the European Union's series of presidents, began.
Járóka Lívia, a representative of the European Parliament, called attention to education segregation in a communication organized by the Scientific Council as a key theme for the plenary, as this is also a major obstacle to the implementation of Roma children's best understanding and understanding.
The High-level Conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Opportunities.
The Council invited governments, European social partners and representatives of European law enforcement and civil society organisations to take their position in the area of possibilities.
Járóka, according to the press release of the Group of Officials of the European Union, warned that, in addition to the differentials of employment, the Roma are increasingly underprivileged with low education on the labour market.
"The majority of Roma youths have no medium-term finality, and as a result of poor quality basic education, they can only have a significant share in higher education."
The player further stressed that as fundamental human rights, education is a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the representative, it is necessary to inform these relations among the most widely known Roman and non - Roma.
Just as Roman students started school earlier, women are able to become members of the labour market; they are contributing to national budgets paid after income and consumption.
"The European Union's citizens must legally guarantee the rights to quality education and ensure the calculation of their low-coloured and distinct education," Járóka Lívia said.
According to the representative, the European Union's objective and action-oriented combination is essential for the immediate strengthening of school disaggregation processes and for the proper allocation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"There must also be an end to poverty, segregation, unemployment and unemployment, and Roma children must be given the opportunity to enter Europe as a full-right citizen," Járóka demanded.
In the European Year of Opportunity for All, the aim of the Council of Europe's annual meeting in Berlin is to ensure a single forum for the promotion of the opportunity and diversity of the objectives set out at European and Member State level.
CSU: transitional period
At the end of October, they decided on the series of Hober-Beckstein's doll.
In spite of the poor election gap, the poor CSU's summits were first held to discuss personal issues.
Mr. Erwin Huber and Mr. Günther Beckstein can still be on the spot, asking how long I've been here.
In the last week of October of the 17th century, a partial convention will be held on Saturday.
Many of the parishioners have felt that they do not have all their strengths in their pockets.
The group and the base angry members were thus forced to settle down, which one day called for personal convections after the "bajor cunami" because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - in fact, with the recent ruling of Edmund Stoiber - the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, only 43.4 percent of them fled after the collapse of Stoiber.
The CSU was "one-off" for 46 years in the German GDP 18 percent tax in Belarus.
In addition, conservationists are highly important to the Hungarian economy in a key south-easterly context, and they are committed to future coalition.
As one of the first signs of the party's internal competition, Mr Horst Seehofer, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is responsible for the possibility of becoming a member of the party, is also taking a position in the field of trade unions that begin negotiations with the liberal FDP or the higher values of the electorate on possible governmental coalition of Munich.
To the weird fan of the Free Elections list, Gabriele Pauli, who used his anti-Stoiber action as a punitive opportunity for Huber-Beckstein, and then suddenly broke up with the high-level political girl concerned.
The CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into something to stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will have an active role to play on 28 September when Stoiber, also from behind, was called the most difficult day of the political deployment of former government heads and former CSU presidents.
Huber stopped several times a week on the CDU, he thought he'd be interested in much more support from his brother's party.
Other CSU politicians understood the fact that the warning was also for CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel shall not be Chancellor if CSU, which plays a significant role in the 2005 national success, is not put in place in any way.
According to Merkel, the loss of CSU will not be a negative result of youth unemployment.
What is of course relevant is that it will not be easy to deal with the CSU, and the social democracy crisis continues.
The SPD accounted for an increase of 18.6 percent since 1946 in Belarus.
Lukasenko resistance: 110-0
The only opposition representative did not enter the White House in the form of Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the welfare and stability provided in the country of Aleksandr Lukasenko, according to the European Security and Cooperation Service (EBESZ), however, by the illegality of voting.
The EBES, sent by 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the answers.
Although 10 million of the country's main legislation has not yet been passed, the opposition gathered by the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) in the wake of yesterday's elections sincerely hoped that the amendment of the Constitution would give rise to the appointment of President Lukasenko four times in the House of Commons with a recent "megenedi" appearance in the House.
That's how the ODSA has been removed from the pre-mixed bunker.
On the basis of the negative expectations, it was hoped that Belarus, which was increasingly dependent on Russia, which was committed to measuring the continuing imports of raw rice, and also contributed to the intervention of the Russian Russian Russian gas pipelines across the country, would like to improve its relationship with the EU, which led to the introduction of the anti-democratic white political system by Lukasenko and other high-ranking politicians.
In the first place, the EESC rejected the fact that when the election campaign was evaluated, positive movements were more positive, and not weaknesses - for example, to prevent the launch of a third of the candidates.
However, the EESC's weekly progress has already taken place in the campaign - during which, in the context of the opposing signs, they could not appear in the press - and in particular, that the opposition could not be counted by the vote.
In addition, the opposition argues that there is still a positive improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Moscow has been subjected to a smaller confrontation with Moscow, still accepting the recognition of South-Oszetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, namely Russia, which is the flag State of Belarus - which is no longer dependent on the two territories.
- We took two steps forward, one after another, but the most important thing is that we started a conversation between Belarus and the EU - we told our seats to Aleksandr Millinkevics.
According to the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain, despite the fact that "the power to allow even one opposition in the unsolicited parliament."
The opposition does not plan to oppose action in the light of the results, but rather tries to send a message on the need for economic reforms to the voters.
- Although we have a lot of problems, we have to print the counter-attacks in Russia, and the local authorities have shown obstacles to the distribution, but I also see that they are increasing their support for the change, even among the elderly, Millinkevic said, instead of cutting Lucasenko, which is the main result of the creation of social security, even for the most officially supported beneficiaries.
- The sale of the country, the time question due to the increase in trade deficit, says Milinkevic.
In view of the anti-corruption policy, Russian observers have qualified democratically for the elections.
Szergej Lebegyev, head of the Community Mission of Independent States, said to the Russian Federation of Rio Novoszty, "not the words, but the deeds of the people believe", thus the lack of opposition is no more than evidence of the existence of white voters.
Brunetta: "Only before a regular worker"
In the history of Chigi Palota alone, manufacturers were trained to produce and install workers.
From today's point of view, this new measure will be taken against the perpetrators, those who block and then go to a coffee shop at work.
The daily anti-political news today was presented to Prime Minister Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, head of the Prime Minister's office.
"The forums - said Brunetta - serve better and more effective work, reduce deficiencies and increase services"
"New, more responsible and more transparent times follow.
This is the real reform," Brunetta stressed.
The preparation of all the buildings of the Ministry of State will be completed with the Chigi Palota.
Masi says that "to prepare the roots is also important in a symbolic sense."
We did not experience opposition on the part of the applicator, but he strengthened the principal: "The workers took appropriate action, everyone cooperated."
So it's over at breakfast, there's no more coffee and bread.
Brunetta Mossy Advisor: "A good little capuccino morning, capable of miracles"
Roman University of Management
In a Council meeting held, the minister said: "In three months, 50 percent of the unemployment in the public sector has been reduced due to the lack of public health, which means more work than six months a year".
He added that the Italian administration should be more effective
, "what's gerdinnamism - according to the minister - has been twice as much as its private sphere in the last 8-10 years and has been well-inflationed."
At the same time, several zeros have been used together, in addition to the submission supported by the Office of the Italian Environment and Consumer Protection Associations to oppose the provisions of the Brunetta Group Regulation.
"As the Department of Public Administration collects data on the recovery of deficiencies due to the disease, the ‘unresponsible days’ list continues to grow" - writes the Consumer Protection Unit.
Italy requested several hundred thousand qualified and hard-working administrative associations to send a letter to the provisions of the Regulation.'
The Regional Administrative Court shall, among other things, attack the removal of an additional schedule for the disease which may lead to a return to service, the extension of the stay of workers at home, which means the period within which the patient can be shown, and other aspects of the new provisions provided by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
Every day in Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents occur, from 3 deaths and 27 permanent pregnancies.
According to the occupational accident insurance data, almost 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
Numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon, which is still one of the most common causes of deaths today, and almost twice as much sacrifice as humans do.
Today, Anmil conducts 58 times in all parts of Italy, the day of the victims of work accidents normally held on the second day of October, to call attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organizations and mass communication.
"The information published by Anmil and the tragic events of the last days also undermines the importance of the prevention of occupational accidents," reported Giorgio Napolitano in a letter to the President of the National Union to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Labour Party of the Baleeti Rockkant.
The Head of State sincerely assessed the obligation "to prevent accidents at work, to protect the interests of the injured workers, to assist the victims' families and to address the issue of public service".
"Of course, and all of us have received an honest response to such a sign, with the extent to which the media and the media are also interested, but in fact we need to deal with events as a day drama, again and again."
Napolitano openly asserts: "We are constantly struggling with sources, which are crucial to financing education and information.
It is particularly important that school-in-school initiatives aimed at directly clarifying the young people involved in entering the world of work.
Our obligation to maintain interest in the significance does not allow us to pay attention to the social importance of the issue and there is a need for more effective legislation to be adopted.
Mr. Gianfranco Fini, President of the Lower House, stressed his part, "that the serious social significance of the death-threatening occupational accidents, which all of us are aware of, is called upon by the institutions to do so before they are brought to an end."
"The data on workplace accidents show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of such signs is still amazingly high," noted Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We don't want to do the same if this is a lower trend, a lower focus, because the biggest tragedies occur right now when the attention is paid."
"We believe that at the general level we still do not do everything to overcome the significance that could be solved through an integrated action programme.
According to our opinion, more strict monitoring and control would be needed - he stressed Mercandelli - and more significant involvement in the field of employment training, starting with school education."
"There is a need for further efforts in order to inform the public about the content and scope of the communication" - he added.
More importantly, however, it would be necessary for a more responsible working environment in view of the significance of a social problem."
After that, Mercandelli condemned "the increased risk-protection margin provided by the victims of accidents at work", as well as "the aid directive to which the system is subject in recent years".
"The aim is to restore the security provided by the insurance to workers, because the number of victims of the accident cannot depend on the lawmakers where they are willing and where they are divided."
MP3 mounts can cause audio harm
For example, MP3 equipment can be used to listen for longer periods of time and higher volume than MP3 equipment -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the EU, the Scientific Committee for New and Recognised Health Risks (SCENIHR) referred to the public opinion today.
"It is clear from the experience that those who hear loud and loud voices in a five- to ten-thousand-a-thousand-a-thousand-a-thousand-a-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-playing-playing voices can suffer in 5-10 percent" - read in the explanation.
"It's a pity that young people who use loud and loud-speakers and mobile phones don't have the right to harm their hearings in return," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific studies indicate an unbiased risk that we need to respond urgently to," the EU said.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to spread information about this.
In the light of the above-mentioned opinion, we must also examine existing verification systems so that they can function properly and take action with the latest technologies."
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of obstetricians and the increase in the number of young people affected by the arrest.
"The researchers confirm that we are concerned, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and interested parties, is ready to examine what possible measures can be taken to protect children and young people who are involved in the detention of disabled persons and similar tools."
The current European security requirement in 100 dB determines the maximum volume of noise emitted by drivers, while increasing concern is the data on noise pollution from overuse of such signal sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level of closure and the duration of the detention, which can significantly reduce the damage caused by these injuries.
The Scientific Committee of the EU is of the opinion that, for users who hear a high voice over five hours (over 89 decibels) during the week, the ban exceeds the maximum present value for the job market.
If someone has heard music in similar situations for a long time, he will be threatened by the remaining hearing damage after five years.
This can affect about 5-10 percent of users, which can also represent 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno appoints a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It's starting today, it's March, the results are expected in June.
This trend was fueled by the Central Government for the operation of a committee called "the future of Rome's capital city", which was assembled this morning in the new post-Caracalla River.
The following six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission shall draw up the Roma directives.
Following the end of March, the Council and the Committee of the Regions shall assess the study and plans to be able to introduce a strategic plan officially approved by the Director-General of the Government and Gianni Alemanno.
"This is a completely independent committee in which every political, social and cultural image represents itself - and it stresses the responsibility of Alemanno - to work out proposals for the development of Rome, which policymakers can support the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Commission.
There is nothing to be said about the incompatibilities of any kind, just a platform where Rome's council can have great plans.
In March, after completing its work, the Commission will be entrusted with a mandate for a specific time period.
In June, we presented a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee called "The Future of the City of Rome" - announced by the Prime Minister.
Those responsible for the Commission's operation, referring to the non-compulsory power of the opinion delivered by the Commission, Alemanno answers: "All depends on what the Commission will do and on what kind of technical proposals will be made on the table.
If the film is consistent, as in France as in the case of the Attali Commission, which I am sure to take in the case of Rome, it will be an important part of the contribution it has provided.
The nature of the policy is often distorted in the day-to-day proceedings and in the urgent cases of time-consuming events.
In this respect, we also look beyond the external aspects, and we plan longer, and we are committed to the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "the Commission does not consider it to be useless "waters" because it will not be fully free to go into a euro, so it serves with thought and aims to introduce the most important elements of the city."
Alemanno says that "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our citizens to focus on the future in a unified way."
Regarding the future, the mayor of Rome laments: "Not only will it be limited to the current governmental frameworks, but will do much better", we see not only the rising Metropolis and the capital status, but also "the role that can be played as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region and what it must play."
Obama, the first American opposition president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician who claims to be independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second American opposition president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decided to break up the American economy, and developed strong ties (as he does today as a personal person) with the enemy Islam."
As the time for elections approaches, attacks against Obama will be halted.
A woman named Miami wrote this on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama suddenly believes that he can achieve the highest public value of a nation, which has already been a total of two rulers and five saints!"
These attacks are really nothing; of course they are racist, but they do not answer to the question of whether they will be a good president. Then there are public investigations: it indicates that Obama will win, even on a significant scale.
In this case there is also one who listens to his feelings and does not listen to his voice.
In the interior of the South States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this to the leaders: we know well that in my vote, the real American home is giving a vote.
The American way of thinking is marked here by a page that has been hidden for the last minute.
"Just talk about what you want, and we'll know where we're going to put our trust in Obama or McCain."
There are those who swear to him: if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
They've never heard of such words until the blacks can be sure of success.
At the same time, despite all the concerns of the Democrats, you're George Bush.
1500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's official time? 89 percent answered that Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it was announced that it was flying home.
In Iraq, he lost 4,500 soldiers, and the Americans were not to pack.
Most of them still think Iraq was the weak point of Bush.
You're in charge of someone who's going to take George W.
USA: The economic collapse of the press has already been felt by the journalists, and the time of the cuts has come in the structures. Many are based on the Internet, because of the printed media's death.
The PEW research agency has asked five hundred American journalists how they feel about their future status and spiritual powers.
Well, almost every journalist on his own's future.
However, there was no clear indication that our concerns about credibility would be reduced.
You don't feel as upset as you used to.
The American journalist's problem is money.
We consider the 2008 crisis to be a weak economic model.
Further serious concerns are expressed to the newsroom, i.e. cuts to the structure of the news.
If we do not want the traditional journal, in the sense of what the great public is doing under this, at least to emphasize, this problem has to be addressed - the journalists have asked.
The phenomenon is a well-known and complex pessimism that characterizes American journalism.
Six percent of journalists and top leaders working on printed media are convinced that national Zionistism is going bad.
At the local level, the press has a 65 percent senior executive position.
Pressed against the electronic press.
It's not hard to see where the world is going.
The biggest publishers are on their way to the Internet, many of which hold that the printed media is "a killer".
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has grown to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed acknowledged that technology is making a lot of progress in the hope that perhaps it will be a success of Zururnalism.
Today, the U.S. press is divided among the structural leaders, that is, the leaders and their working scientists.
At national level 56 percent of managers are sure to share information with others while at local level this rate can only be made up of 23 percent.
Sometimes this is connected to a certain place of work.
At national level, 47 percent of the managers are in a position to lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In the United States, the question of "confidential work" is part of a team (in the case of our editors) that is constantly on the agenda.
There are only 13 percent of journalists in the contract.
For a powerful nation like the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where several hundred years of news, movies, radio, television and Internet service are operating, workers usually offer as much as they would like to, so the thing "is not necessary".
The managers usually receive a high salary, and the editors can also look for $10 per month for cash and health insurance fees.
The freedom, however, works perfectly well: in the first year x day, in the third level, until a certain period does not reach the maximum 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own belief, are often "patient" during the year.
It's all about the universe.
UNIPOL: BROTHERLANDS: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTATERRABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudou, the president of the second criminal member of the Roman Court, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, who wanted to transfer his residence from Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
In the context of an ongoing investigation on the basis of an agreement with the Unipol-BNL participant on the basis of an ongoing investigation on the economic burden against Coppola.
In the past week, during the anti-dumping procedure, domestic security was suspended and the housing status for Grottafertara was changed.
The lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella were asked to transfer the homeless to the capital of the country.
According to the Court, however, these investigations (for which the judge has proposed an exemption) would allow the company to influence the proceedings and to contribute to the evidence presented against it.
The product is in danger
The presence was already felt a few days ago when the House of Lords did not vote for 700 billion dollars of medical supplies, which had been distributed by the White House: the Americans were more interested in a significant part, and still interested in the arrest of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is supported by the New York Times yesterday, which informs that the current crisis has led to a rise in the Republican Parton, which shows increasing participation among the traditional, restored, the former party supporting the federal institutions and the business environments and a growing trend in the medium and southern states, with the new direction against Washington and the financial world.
This Directive has been published in a critical manner during the voting of the representative House of Representatives mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the significant changes that you can see or see before the current economic competition, and not only in the United States but in the whole modern world, perhaps beyond that.
It seems that the crisis in the United States and Europe only highlights the signs of a good time map, which are being put into this new atmosphere and finally reaches the sky.
The first such importance is the return of the second category of renewal, the second category of state sovereignty to the university, with regard to the reorganisation of the economy.
The crisis is the same as the banking institutions that have such a close relationship with the outside world, but primarily, and are likely to have a wide range of people and families with themselves, living in a single country, in a state.
This, however, is a direct political difficulty for the government's citizens: how they respond to the difficulties and criticisms of people who are elected individually.
Thus, in economic terms the crisis seems to be as global as it is, but in political terms it is only national.
It seems that political internationalism has been essentially a part of the dividend: this is an old evidence of the European Union, which is unable to identify a uniform policy guide between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, all of the national governments are expected to enter into the package, reorganisation and new rules, but, above all, to open the money books: because, in the long run, some States only have economic resources, a financial provision that can make things okay.
They also have tools and competence to use them: in these circumstances, there are two sources of invaluable value, which are likely to never have any other market and one international organisation in such a way.
On the other hand, the new voice set out by the crisis to the nation is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent years has a greater significance for a factor that is closely linked to this element: this is the territoriality.
In the same way, while we were winning that we were already entering the network, the more sophisticated technology has gone into the world, and we have been convinced that the global financial world has made it possible to control the world, we have just had to realize that our future is more and less dependent on things like water, nature and oil.
From things that can be transferred from one part of the planet to the other, to another, to a fully defined location, to one area.
Thus, those who inherit the land have more than one of those who have been born in a place where there is no nature, no oil, and no water.
I'd go through this to the second novelty, which leads to a series of strokes.
He who says that the territory, the state, the government, is also saying that it is political, otherwise leading.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two interconnected significance:
Part of the objective is to identify the need for reliable guidance, for someone who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular the full credit loss of economic leaders, who have proved totally useless and have proved that many have gone ahead of the country.
The two groups are even more meaningful and are more refreshing in a certain sense: the feeling of loss of faith, intolerance, incompatibility and impartiality, which is more and more important in a developing country.
It seems that the people are growing closer to the conviction that the social crisis that is so long ago has been overdue. It seems that before they have done, their experiences, their life patterns, their cultures, in the sense of the complex word, they would have done it to themselves. This social expression is becoming more interesting than most people think.
Similarly, the demand for leadership, in a busy form, is a strong delegation movement in the view of the ruling class and the traditional political system. These voters are not expected to be in "classes", or in recent times the sudden change in the average. For example, the power of conservatives in Austria and Belarus, the integration of the labor force into Great Britain, or the presence of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the success of the Italian side can also be achieved here).
It seems that the traditional approach, its partners, its programmes, and the fact that we can say that in a society with its culture, its media and its limited understanding, it is less meaningful, so it is less able to imagine what a time is going on in the deeper areas of modern society. Moreover, the economic crisis is growing, widening and potentially able to achieve even greater demands.
In spite of all of this, it would be too much to speak of "the coming of the great crowd."
But it's not a good idea to walk with an open eye.
We've got a superhero on the floor with a superhero.
With the help of a superhero, conquer gravity and walk like Pokeman.
This objective has been fueled by several U.S. research centres, and a group of four institutions is approaching the solution.
The researchers managed to put a 100 kilograms of meat in a single square of a square inch [2.5 cm].
TANULMANY - The American Journal of Science published the findings of a number of researchers from the Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance found by the scientific group has been born from further development of existing, special, non-nautical structures that have already existed in the past.
"The principle of the operation of the striker must be imagined as a package like a spaghetti chain," says the researchers of the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers have described the idea of a foot covered with deep microscopic roots, which provides perfect shelter for the animal.
The tests carried out with various substances, such as wine, teflon, and cyszolom paper, have shown that the new tenfold is more effective than the above-mentioned hooks, while the researchers of Liming Dai, of the day-to-day mercanic karma, are "sustained from the falcon."
FALON JÁRNI? - "This material can be useful as a temporary ingredient" - add Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers think more of a less exciting use than the combination of electronic equipment, because the toothpaste is well leading the heat and the electrical price.
Further applications can be found in the area of radiation.
The superheroes can still wait.
MUSIC COUNTRIES - the California Barkley Agency is also conducting experiments with a new ingredient.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society c., Californian scientists have shown a mixture made of a common, microsacrifical substance that is used to stimulate the movement of the surface, so that it always ensures perfect healing.
The drugs?
Care must be taken with grapefruit, oranges and apples.
These high vitamins, mainly popular salts, when mixed with certain life-threatening medicines, change their absorption, update or reduce their effect, depending on the case. This may also have serious health consequences.
In the 236th country meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, Professor David Bailey called attention to the risk of co-administration of toxic or fresh fruits and certain medicinal products, and to reduce the incidence of certain life-threatening drugs, preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit was previously exposed to the disease when it was found that some antibiotics, antihistamines, sordidone, heart rate control and anti-diabetes may appear to be toxic.
Two years ago, the Olass Medical Institute published its official report and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-administration and to pay attention to what medicines are taking, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NAM CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, narcs and alpine also contains substances that interfere with the efficacy of medicines.
The list of active substances that prevent the addition of grapefruit and other fruit trees could be extended for a long time.
This draws attention to Michele Carruba, professor of the United States Medical School in Milan: "These findings are usually made immediately by different national and international medical institutions, who, if necessary, are concerned about changing the information provided by the notified body.
Therefore, you should always read the package leaflet, and if something is not understood, do not let yourself be affected, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice" - the Ansa Institute stressed to the patients.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Publicity
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Public Affairs, Trade Models and Economic Activities for the study of regional relations.
The 55-year-old neokinesian Krugman, Princeton University, is a well-known publisher of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the smallest judges of the Bush Government's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron was arrested, Krugman, in his New York Times, pointed out that the last event will have more devastating consequences than the concentration of terrorists in the United States' history.
This announcement has raised a few questions, and in many ways it has been addressed to the publisher, but today we know it was correct.
"I'm tired too, and a little too often how fast Enron or Worldcom's botanical collapse has been," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "ropint valuable publisher", while possibly "progressively spreading the criticisms of the Bush government overliberalism."
Open Office also understood third edition of the "Microphone" package
Today, it features an open software package that increases the productivity of OpenOffice.org 3.0, which aims to make the Office more popular as a free alternative, from home to office users and from free administration.
The SUN Microsystem, supervised by the SUN Microsystem and, after almost one year's work by volunteer developers, the new Open Office has come to the public with more news: it offers more information on the image of the welcome and on the newly thought smaller slot users. For example, Apple Mac OS X is compatible with the operating system, and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format according to the ISO standard.
Special attention was paid to the compatibility with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can also open new expanded Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Important for some other specific modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint indicators. This can be useful for e-mail file transfer. Another feature supports importing into the PDF file graphical module by maintaining the site settings.
We also create hybrid PDF documents that combine the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
The internal distribution of applications has also been developed in a number of ways: the board manager supports the common use of the workshops, but prohibits the termination of other work. All workers' involvement is marked by another color, which helps to make the best identification possible at the time of inspection.
Some companies are already working to make some of the OpenOffice's functions available on the Internet (on the cloud, above), so the final change can probably be introduced in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available in English since the leaves of the mirror pages can be found at: http://it.openoffice.org/Download/3.0.0/Download300.html
The software package is also available to Linux in addition to normal Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can transfer the installation CD to either at home or at our place of work.
With regard to the spread of domestic use, freedom probably means the greatest attractiveness, but the Open Office software package is now trying to get rid of the business sector, as it can also be counted on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, advice and services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business distances.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compatible text editor; Calc, Excel-placed table manager; Impress, Powerpoint presentation; Dbase is the most popular, access database manager; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The 2008 goal is to reach 5 million downloads, but if we consider that we already have a new version of 3,600,000, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Also positive for the score, this is the fourth dopping game.
In the last phase of the Tour de France, one of the participants, the Gerolsteiner group’s contestants Bernhard Kohl, who also won the triumph of the best climber.
The news was on the website of the Team's Internet News.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitionr, the Italian Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepol, and the German, following the third generation of Gerolsteiner, Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test.
Its blood count, similar to the tests performed in the last weeks, was examined by the labs of lasanne and Chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests also confirm the positive effect of Cera, the districts will lose their third location and the requirements shall be removed from competition for two years.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French Doppingese Agency, also confirmed the positive outcome of the third generation EPO test, and announced to the Associated Press Agency that it had shown the positive doppling resistance to the authorities of the districts.
The 26-year-old districts of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans were on their way to the doboger, and they have also won the best mountain trip.
COVER SUBJECT: A NEW YORK IS POSSIBLE FOR BATCH RELEASE
It has only recently changed the country of foreigners from Italy to one of the most popular destinations.
This question arises from the case of young Burkina Faso, by Abdul William Guibre, who had been killed in Milan last month because he had lost a box box - a long article about racism in Italy.
The case well illustrates what the New York Times called "the Iron Paradox": in the northern regions, "the stronger integration and the stronger employment" is also the "immigrant resistance and the Northern League's support" in the country.
In order to address the growing gap between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also discusses events in Milan, Parmá, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Oh, yeah.
New laws adopted by the League, which would make the student more aware of immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, as examples of the change of voice in Italy.
This trend is also expressed by the President of the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. He met with his colleagues at the Quirinale Palace, and announced that the State and the Church would work together in order to overcome racism."
The students are suffering from expensive gambling fees, which may take up a room in 900 euros
The market for hotels issued by universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Association of Residents of Finland, one student can pay up to EUR 900 for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The presence has already created impressive amounts, which - due to the three major costs for families - the students close wide sections of learning from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office of Sunia. "In these cities, the high demand for students has been raised to such a extent that the market has also resulted in a general drag process in view of local residents."
In most cases, property holdings also contain a number of irregularities: contracts not registered, non-restricted or limited by patents.
According to Sunia, there would be a need for a regulatory measure that would allow the tax system to maximize prices by reviewing the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, there are also 450 euros for a bed; the price of the individual room is approximately EUR 650 (Bande Nere) to 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it is also available to 900 euros (Vittoria area).
In the garden, a bed is made up of about 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students live near the university, one bed is made up of 250/280 euros, if it is double, and 370-500 euros, if it is one room.
In Rome, around 600 euros are requested for a private and 450-person bed in a two-person room near central schools (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna).
With some cheaper (EUR 550 per room) prices are around the other university (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can store everything in foreign fields: 300 Euros are made in a bed and 450 in a single room Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar areas.
In the afternoon, 300/450 euros are requested for a stay, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price range is the highest in the area of Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Amini.
You need to pay EUR 250/350 for a bed in a bar and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are as low as they are, but they represent greater force in the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where foreign students are often seeking accommodation in the EU, another problem can be identified: the foreign students are asked to pay less than 25-30 percent higher than Italian immigrants.
Good old cinema Paradise, the age of the old mossiers in the cities
Traditional music is closed for the Multiplex.
"A city where there's no music, a blind city, like a face without a face."
The images produced by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively show everything in Italian cities, but also in foreign regions.
The shortness of music - the appearance of large, multi-heating music in foreign cities, and then the removal of the fires found in urban centres - seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time leads to all the features of a genuine cultural crime.
When historical and memorable places seem to go away, "it's like a friend of ours going out, a famous one with whom we shared our journeys and many experiences," says the director of the cinema Paradiseo. The film, which had been awarded Oscar a hundred years ago, and the big part of the Cannes festival, told Tornatore about the story of a small music song, the story of the drama, the horror, after a music that probably took place for all of us.
The largest unit of workers, the data published by Anec are widely spoken: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed. The biggest loss in the cities of music could be recorded: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Romania, 6 Turin, and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is alive among the most affected regions, which has lost 82 concerts, followed by Toskána (44) and Lombardia (41).
And for them to disappear, the generation of multiplexes is no better than in Italy's three regions, the largest number of new-opened multi-threat music: in the last five years, the number of the product increased in Lombardia, 81 in Toszcana and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of Italian units has increased radically," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It's okay that we build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of the already existing ones, because when a city's music locker is not all going to pass through the multiplexes.
It is not even talking about the financial bases available to support operators: the State's outstanding assets can amount to around EUR 10 million.
In ethical and moral terms, it is also shameful that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
The market would need EUR 16-18 million a year to maintain the market."
This is the first Italian city to deal with the concerns of the prisoners in order to address the problem through the government and the agreement between Anec, in order to protect and coordinate the music of the outside and the interior.
The provisions include the tax incentives provided by operators and the benefits offered by the public to promote accessibility: viewers can enter the restricted roads and can park with a favourable tariff in certain parking lots.
"This initiative is a test," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, as well as other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional music, in order to be able to overcome the struggle with the rule of multiplexes, needs to be improved in sound and skill, because today's society is more demanding.
The traditional music collection was always an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Baghia - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the scar, which I finally made the cinema Paradise, and I had spent ten years on it.
I live in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Rialto prison or the Quirinale, that I don't see any plates from the gate, I'll turn my head again. I've been here for so long."
Serious disputes between politics and 'draggy' were held by the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in decision-making."
Serious charges were filed against Gioia Tauro Mayor and deputy mayor, Giorgio Dal Torione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarino Mayor Carlo Martelli, who were charged with the extra part of the crime covenant this morning.
Bilinks was awarded to Gioacchino Piromalli, a peaceful mediator between the clan and the administration, as well as to the principals, who had already been admitted to a mafia crime union, and was charged with 10 million euros.
"The rule of law and the rule of law has nothing to do with more taste," the government reports. The two local governments have expressed their intention to pay the council fees to Piromelli lawyers.
"The clan would have been officially admitted to the city, which would have given further opportunity to monitor and guide the administration, which is already important.
Agazione Loiero, president of the Calabrian region, does not hide that in the region there is "a number of mergers between local institutions and the organised sub-world": There are areas where the spread of mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the merger is almost inevitable.
However, a number of local politicians are opposed to the pressure of 'dragneta, those of the heroes who remain clean'.
Today's detentions are continuing on July, when the police announced that they had succeeded in completing the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were freed from their trust in the administration of the government. In 1991, Gioia Tauro's own government committee had been deplored once and again because of the inter-organization of the crime and of the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, a Christian Democrat mayor who was praised for his dedication, was born in the second round of 2006.
He was excommunicated when the Church ordered the delegation of the Committee of the Government.
The court presented the Deputy Prime Minister Marco Minninini, who accused him of planning everything for political purposes, but the court issued a detention order signed this morning that the Piromalli branch was still involved in following the amendment of the A3 project.
In view of the statement made by Dal Torrion, the government reports that "there was a growing tendency to make enough of the demands of companies representing a group in Piromelli's community, including the Piromelli family, to inform the public of its decision to make its decisions on the merits."
The energy comes from my lungs, and now the big ones come.
An unexploded energy source that produces 70 percent of the planet's surface, which is now being closed by major international energy companies
The waves, the waves, the tides, all the renewables of energy, have taken me to the heart of horrors like Chevron, who are now trying to shake their hands.
For hundreds of years, they have been searching for the possibility of how the sea moves could gain energy. In the '70s, research increased during the first century of the oil year.
About 1980, when oil prices decreased, the concept of the use of marine energy was ignored, but today the needs of the environment and the renewed increase in oil prices give rise to new developments in the sector.
According to the 2007 World Energy Council (WEC) estimates, 15 percent of the world's electricity price needs could be met with facilities that use the water supply.
This is a two-fold increase in the amount currently established by nuclear devices.
There's still prices and prices up there.
The horrors are in place.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in Northern Portugal.
It seemed like a turning point when the signature was signed.
It has been two years since, and more and more companies have become involved in maritime energy, including those who have been the advocates of traditional energy.
"The Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies, and takes the opportunity to cooperate with us," said the manager of one of the American Olympics, the Wall Street Journal's business journal.
This cooperation concerns the acquisition of the necessary authorisation for the launch of a basic project for the use of marine energy by the American Energy Agency.
The matter is not of little importance, especially if we consider that the US is currently producing oil in Alaska, which President Bush has recently launched a plan on further paints.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are the source of energy from the sea. The amounts already invested, as far as the details can be known, give evidence of increased interest.
Technology is waiting for development.
Experts say that there is still an introductory technology, but only because the energy available from the sea does not give rise to doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing, Portuguese or Scottish facilities are both small, so they do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to generate energy in a greater way, there is a need for structures that are even more important to the environment.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses one of the connectors.
The cuts from the roots and the roots from the roots are made into hydraulic pressure of the ducts in which they are placed.
The pressure's causing a turbine that's on a generator table.
The electric price comes to the coastal surface of the sea.
At the same time, there are four similar structures in the design phase, which are waiting for the federal permit only. The energy produced is used in a military facility.
The Verdant Power, however, has already started the production of energy for a shopping center and a parking lot with the aid of six marine turbines located in the East River in New York.
The movement of the water in the water causes the leaves of the turbines to freeze, and this is the type of movement that captures the generator.
Verdant stated that he has a long list of partners waiting for only the permission to use energy.
It's after my hair.
Special attention is currently being paid to the options available through the market.
As for age, the price can be seen as more predictable than the wind, the day, or the waves, and therefore as a more reliable energy source.
In 2008, New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the rest of the country, spent $7.5 million on energy consumption at the market. This amount is expected to be 35 million women in 2009.
