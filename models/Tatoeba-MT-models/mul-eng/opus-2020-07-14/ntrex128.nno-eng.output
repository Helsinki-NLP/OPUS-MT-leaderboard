Welsh members of the National Assembly are ready not to be taken seriously
A number of members of the National Assembly were recently informed of a proposal to amend the name of the Assembly member or AM (convencing Member) to the member of the Wallisian Parliament or the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The response was due to plans to amend the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned about their being latent.
A member from the lab said his group is worried about your "MWP reminiscent of Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "twp" is gentle and "pwp" is gentle.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group "no key" has proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group had an "open mind" when it came to the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muffet".
In this context, the Wallis letter w is not different from the English Yorkshire dialect's expression of the letter u.
The National Assembly of its delegation, which is now writing legislative proposals for the introduction of the name exchange, said: ‘The final decision on which members of the National Assembly are to attend will certainly be made to the members themselves.’
A wali official decision from 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public statement on the name-proposals which showed great support for calling the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of the members of the national assembly, the delegation referred to the Welsh Parliament member or the WMP, while the MWP option was most supported during the public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly have certainly come with other proposals, but the struggle to become a few has given the chairman of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work, to deliver the legislative proposal for a few weeks.
The ratification of the reforms includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on what they must vote when they discuss the legislative proposal.
Macedonians smoke in public destruction to change their country's name
The electors shall, on Sundays, take their place in order to change the name of their country to the ‘North-Macedonia Republic’.
The peoples were determined to resolve a conflict that has taken place for many decades with the surrounding Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a requirement on the territory and has many objections to Macedonia's requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjerge Ivanov, a opposition of the People's Party on the change of names, said he came to see the outcome.
Those who support the populace, including Minister of State Zoran Zaev, argue that the correct change of name is the price to be a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin’s Church in Harlem, New York, stars
"The old I have spoken to say that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adam.
‘Today none of the shares exist.’
He said he understands why the wounds disappeared.
"People socialize in other ways today," he said.
‘Only no longer are the substances in the neighborhood that people visit to normal.’
When it comes to the church, he is concerned that the money from selling property does not come to be as long as the leaders fear, "and before or after they are back where they start."
He added that churches can be replaced by participation opportunities filled with the kind of people who do not care to help the historical cities in the neighborhood.
"The majority of those who buy shares in these buildings are white," he said. "and so comes the day when all churches are closed, because it is not possible that these people who move into the shares are going to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white sugar before Harlem became a black offering - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Sankt Martin church a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black couch that had been preaching near, moved into the building.
Sant Martin was taken over by a black soda lease by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the shopkeepers in 125th Street, a principal trader in Harlem whose owners were opposed to adding or promoting blacks.
The building found great damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to build him up, they also ordered a new watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson Senior and successor of St. Martin, was proud and called the clock “the clocks of the poor.”
The expert who played at the game in July called it something else: "A cultural tax" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also commented that it was the first time in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the biggest time in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Sankt Martin could not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Sankt Martin in the past months has become a complex explanation of architects and construction workers, some of the additions of the leaders of the church, and others of the episcopal bipedal doctrine.
The Sakristi, who is the leader of the people, wrote to the Bishop in July with concerns that the Bishop 'would ask the Emperor to pay,' even though the sarcissist was not involved in his addition to architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the suction have complained about the lack of openness from the bishop's office.
13-year-old damage to your hair during hummardy in California
Photography reports that a 13-year-old was attacked by a thief on Saturday while he was digging for hummers in California on the day of the opening of the hummarse season.
She took her right before 7:00 a.m. the morning near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had covered with his friends about a half-hour shift in the morning when he heard that the guy called for help. He fell off to the guy with a group and took him out of the water.
Hammel said that for the first time he trusted only the good was the best to get a hummer, before he realized that the good guy cried «noko beat me!
I'm sick of it."
"His whole strength was running away," Hammel said he observed when he reached the good.
"I swear that everyone had to come out of the water: it's a river in the water!" said Hammel.
The good was obtained from air conditioning and taken to Rady's hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's definitely what kind of hair it was like attacking the good.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a horse had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous black horse.
It's good for the guy to find serious damage to the body.
The authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas in 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Gilles commented that there are more than 135 different species in the area, but most of them are not afraid to be dangerous.
Bottled Sainsbury's saters on beauty products
The British shopper Saninsbury's is to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer wholesale gas services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK’s beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while the dispute and interior sala is going down, Sainsbury’s test of beauty products will take place in 11 stores next year, and several shops if it becomes a success.
Investment in beauty products comes at a time when the holes that were supposed to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products for 3000 products and offer brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They shall give L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots shops.
The shop also has to relax its own taste series Boutique and make most of the products vegan, something to attract several young customers.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop shall test the salts of its perfumes in two of the Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the other will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Action on the network and a change to buy small amounts of food every day from local retail stores means that large stores need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director in Sainsbury's, has commented that the shops will see more and more as a wholesale, while the shops are trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl low price shops with several services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has met with interior-class Argos in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat shops since they bought both chains two years ago. Sansbury's claims that this has increased the supply and thus protected the purchase.
The previous attempt to renew beauty and apocalypse divisions was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not know how they would share the profit from the apothecary in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sales apothecary Celesio, who had 281 apothecaries and owned apothecary Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They let Lloyds still have a role to play and offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including the label La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Saninsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how beautiful the hills will look and experience in order to improve the environment for our kids.
We have also added colleagues with special competencies to be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to meet all the needs, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of dealing with.”
Peter Jones "responsible" after Holly Willoughby moved from the deal worth £11 million
The stars from the Dragon's TV program, Peter Jones, are "responsive" after the TV value Holly Willoughby came out of an agreement with his life-style brand worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to promote the internal and access mark of their Truly.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from this morning, 37, made news on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of the new co-operation of a life-style brand to focus on his own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “slow” when the golden Holly attended an intensive meeting on Tuesday in the capital of Jones's business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - means that he no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and access mark Truly.
The cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated amount of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that he shouldn't work with Truly, while Jones slept in the United Kingdom to rest in one of his holiday houses.
One source said: "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and it would be for many decades.
Her determination to move out has surprised all involved.
No one touched his own islands on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a house in Marlow filled with goods ready for salt.»
Experts hope to decide on this morning's value, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions due to heavy investments in the product, from powder to starlight to clothing and interior, and can cause delays in launching.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is mother to three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been our close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the mark Truly together with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, and became the governing officer in March.
Couples celebrate together with Jones with 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Clear Conversations "And so We Love Us"
He wondered if the criticism he came to get from the media to come up with a comment some might experience as “unpresiding” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Said Trump with his customs address as ‘new news readers’.
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the collapse of the nuclear weapons programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear-weapon-free programme have ended.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea Ri Yong Ho told the UN World leaders on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "responsive answer" from the United States concerning North Korea's former collapse.
Instead, he added, continued the US with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It goes well between us and North Korea," he said.
"We should go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve his relationship with Kim has brought positive results – the end of the rocket test, help free the hostages and restore the lives of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it came to relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and Peika to the group that stood before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia damaged eyes and killed hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organisations reported that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok residents had to flee, there was no declared national crisis status, which is essential for international emergency assistance.
“In many cases, they are very clear that they do not want international assistance, so it is a bit challenging,” said Sumbung.
While Redd Barna set up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to add foreign pass permits to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations for emergency aid are available.
Although Indonesia is often represented as land mines, the country is not particularly vulnerable to natural forces.
In the Aceh region, they have built access spaces for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Following warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, something most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between Indonesian eyes is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was lying in a cave in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now fighting for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the city of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on addressing the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made the administration difficult for President Joko, and the next year it is again.
President Joko is also being pressured when there are due sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have taken good care of his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslims were fighting in the streets and using masks, pills, and books, as well as other primitive weapons.

Parliamentary status of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the "recording of history"
The removal of the statue would be a karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as his Puritan followers did during the civil war of the 1600s.
However, the Cromwell Association explains Crick’s proposal to remove the status as a ‘duty’ and ‘a attempt to write about history’.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Union, said: "It was impossible in the current debate on the removal of the statutes that the status of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be a goal.
The iconoclasts during the English Civil War were kork ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, centuries ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's remarkable representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the history of a figure that many still seems worth celebrating.”
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still seen today as a defence of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was self-indicted against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not, there is still a discussion theme in the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual we knew represented one side of that distinction.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.»
Killing and killing Chinese Bonds
A bond was attacked and killed by a crisis on a market in South-West China, according to local media reports.
The man, named after Yuan, was found dead, with cunt pulse years and covered with blood, near a grey band on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A gray band is ready to give rice vaccines on a garden on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his fatter from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 greys on the market.
The next morning he found the fatter his death, and found out that the door to one of the greyheads was open.
He said there was a big hangar with blood around his mouth.
The survey showed that a 250 kilograms of fat grass had killed the bond, according to the report.
"The leg to my fat was bloody and corrupt," said the fatter, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras show Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to eat the vegetables.
Like he was found to lay an hour later.
The animal that killed him didn't listen to Yuan or his fatter.
The marketing director told Evening News that the gray had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family now negotiates compensation with the market leader.
Even if it is rare, such reactions have already occurred from greys.
In 2016 a crisis hit a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a 205 - pound [295 kg] heavy gray held a walisic bonded prisoner between himself and a tractor, until his wife ran away.
After a bond in Oregon was eaten by its grisenes in 2012, a bond from Manitoba to CBC News reported that grises are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can attract animals.
"You just want to play.
They look like a little bit, they're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
The remains of the Rosa Orc bring rain to the southwestern United States
As mentioned in the weather report, the Orcene Rosa will be swaggering over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will prepare with a posse account for North and South America the next few days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was a source of category 1 until 05:00 in the eastern zone of the United States on Sunday, and the centre was 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa must move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean that moves out to the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California semi-wave on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical moisture north to the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical fungiheite will react with low pressure and cause dry rain in the south in the next days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 cm rain can create dangerous flowers and possible landscapes in the desert.
Tropical humidity will result in rain between 5 and 7 cm per hour in some parts of the south-west USA, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain are expected in parts of the south-west USA; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flowers may arise because of widespread earthquakes and tropical rain.
It turns out to be in the desert for foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can make clouds of flammable electricity and the lyn and tortors will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast in southern California.
Total droplets of more than 1 cm are possible, something that can create small flowers and smooth walls.
This will be the first census for the season in the region.
Spreaded tropical rainforests will start in Arizona last Sunday evening and early Monday morning before the rain rises late on Monday and Tuesday.
Four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while Arctic is getting colder, but tropical currents will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
It's almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next days will be summer heat trying to build up and spread again.
A great deal of central and eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the great cities to the parts of the Northeast-US.
New York City can now be 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there is a high chance of the average temperatures in the East-US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million views on Brett Kavanaugh's height
On Thursday, more than 20 million people were witnessing to Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Highway and women who owed him sexual losses in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political debate continued, with a break in the regular television programmes of various broadcasting companies to discover the latest news events on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI should investigate the charges during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court that he is 100% sure that Kavanaugh ordered her when he was full and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, under a curious rule, that he's 100% sure it's not her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the rise on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this point by finding the average number of winners on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Numbers were not clear from other channels showing right, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also been trying to count seafarers looking at the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar division.
Fox News's hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also it with most seamen during the day with 5.69 million sails, said Nielsen.
ABC was on the other side of 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million sails, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in the right.
Flake was focused on the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate republican, declared himself on the side of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protestors called after him on his way to a hearing with a trial committee on Friday.
He stood and looked in the back for a few minutes while the Protestants were beating him at CNN's life.
"I'm right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you believe him to tell the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had spoken, and before he went into the horse he said he would have more to see under the committee's seat.
The Board of Appeal showed the right of television where the Court of Justice had to smoke for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh for full late and further smoking.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh over the next week, something the Democrats have also asked.
Flake was partially superior after talking to his companion, the Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision seemed to have power, because it was clear that the Republicans could not smoke for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes criticism of 'like politics' when it comes to Brexit
The Ministry of State of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, is responsible for the criticisms of its plans to leave the EU in order to "like policies" for the future of the United Kingdom without prejudice to national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
On the side of the May interview, on the front page of Sunday Times, an interview is held with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who is going to take on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect any of its charges is ‘complete absurd’.
Wayde Sims Shooting in the United States: Police arrests the mysterious Dyteon Simpson for Sims Shooting
The police arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting band Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and arrested for deliberate murder, says the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses under the target.
The police found the glasses on the wall and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is connected to CBS.
After Simpson's release, the police said he agreed to have shot Wayde.
The result of Simpson was set to $350,000, reports the lawyer's local address.
The Colonel of East Baton Rouge published an early discharge report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police take over the state policy of Louisiana's special forces, the state policy of its crime, the Southern University police and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletes' director at LSU, Joe Aleva, thanked the local police for being “stupid in achieving justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meters high basketball player woke up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
In average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 backwards per game before season.
Friday morning, the LSU-Basketball player Will Wade said the team is "powerless" after Wayde was killed.
"That's something we're always ready for," said Wade.
Vulkan asks about Mexico City
Osca from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Crisis Prevention requests Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increased in the crater and centre registered 183 gas and discharges within 24 hours.
The center had observed several spaces and maps.
Social media image shows thin layer of ice on cars in different neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south of the capital, since a earthquake powered at 7.1 root central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Politicians join Catalan separatists before the anniversary of suicide
Six protestors were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations of self-sustained shooting together with political forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against suicide one year after the explosion of any settlement from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while they threw eggs and powder chains that created dark clouds of dust in streets normally filled with tourists.
Consistency also broke out later that day, and the police used tons of tobacco to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists called "Don't forget, don't leave" while the protestors against themselves called, "Long live Spain".
Local news channels reported that the 14 people were treated for minors after the protests.
The vote is still printed in the region, and many will still have self-sustained one year after the 1st October, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the well-beings are for self-sustaining, but there was also a low choice among those who were against self-sustaining and boycotting.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in prison after the police tried to prevent the shooting and selective co-operation in the region.
Groups that were too self-sustained on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the state police.
The demonstration, however, came from the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protests together with a woman said that he no longer has hope of suicide in Catalonia.
“In the past we experienced one of our best interests.
And I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to laugh for themselves, but now while we are still standing," he said.

Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was home to politicians on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders, who have been part of the current legal proceedings since last year, declared that he should vote in the European Parliament next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

A fingerprint may have been used to shoot the car.
Many shots give Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Mega's first goal for Livingston sure says
Appointed Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experience their second words after 18 matches training for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot showed to make the difference while Gary Holt's side of the game with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no extras in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and will play against Hearts, who are behind eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers must be familiar with Rapid Vienna in the European Union on Thursday.
Livingston has six rounds of winning, and chief coach Holt has not yet died since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of extinction
Holt's bed would have been rent long before the score, and created more problems for Rangers with the direct player's say.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had little effort towards the goal, something that made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett his heading over the target.
The housewife was the key to letting Rangers play in front of them, well aware that they could create a dormitory for the waste.
And that was so the decisive goal was scored.
Rangers went on a freepark and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the scene.
Before then, Ranger's ball was dominated, but he saw that the home defense was solid and Captain Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued in another half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but he was stopped by Rangers' driver Allan McGregor, and Lithgow looked as soon as the ball was returned from Livingston.
Adjustments were sent and returned to the Livingston crime scene, while two punishments - after Halket's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were removed.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland without Alaskar Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal fight and a phenomenal outcome for Livingstone.
Every player played fantastic and still imposes on the curve above.
The game and player style have changed almost since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he pushed the layer on the side he was trained.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while many distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the struggle.
Ranges were not motivated in the opposite direction.
One as good as they've been under Gerard, though, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and just cut up the rest of the house once, something that should get Rangers to realize that they didn't get up again.
Erdogan receives mixed welcome in Cologne
The government leaders in Turkey and Germany fell under blue sky when they met to celebrate the fruit on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is expected to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The country is unique when it comes to human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan took to Cologne to open a large, new Moscow.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevent a population of more than 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for "safety reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters met up to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of the Kurdians - also met up to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's decision to wish him welcome in the country.
The duplicating Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who look at Erdogan as a whole, and others who look at him as an autocrat.

The body of Rosa attracts Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flame (for the benefit of drying area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it's just such a veneer that is fighting against Arizona early next week, in the rest of the Orcion Rosa took the south-west of the desert and creates fear of flame.
The national host has gone out with warnings against floods on Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona and eastern Nevada, South California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.

It can be calculated between 2 and 5 centimetres in other areas of the southwest, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total quantities up to 10 centimetres.
For areas outside the risk of fluoride, the account from Rosa can be a blessing in dry weather.

Trump sails Kavanaugh's "lying" under the crown of "silence and silence" the democracies were against him
"A riot for the judges of Kavanaugh is a riot against the merciless and gruesome tactics of the Democrats," said Trump under a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had a "lying" under the direction of "silent and sweet" democracies was through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness before the convention on Thursday, and refused to give emotional evidence of the charges made by Christine Blasey Ford that he had abused her sexually for several decades, when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness about her debts during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A rape of judges Kavanaugh is a rape of one of the most prominent lawyers in our time, a lawyer with a free service in the public," he said to a large number of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to smoke in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important whales in our life.
I'm not doing it, but I'm really doing it," he said.
“It’s for me to travel around to fight for good candidates.”
Trump argued that the democracies were out after "standing against and blocking".
The first important strike in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, said a Republican representative to CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, talking about killed increases
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, hit the beach at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they had come over.
The tsunami came after a earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the warning of tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not take it once and thus were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia BNPB, said Jakarta.
"As if not the tsunami was enough in itself, he took his cars, trimmings, house; he framed everything on the ground," said Nugroho, and let the tsunami travel over the open sea in a speed of 800 km/h before he reached the coast.
Some fell into three ways to avoid tsunamis and survive that way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 cents in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the crisis agency shows many damaged buildings and shops, damaged and collapsing bridges and a Muslim water circulation.
Etterskjärk continues to cover the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake could be observed in the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s technology testing and testing Agency (BPPT) said that the energy generated by the earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, small wall, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “overload” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found during the rest of the collapsed buildings, he said, and let 540 people be damaged and 29 still are missing.
Nugroho said that the number on the surface and the size of the damages can be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donghea, which is closer to the surface.
"We haven't got anything from Donghea, the communication is cool," said Nugroho.
‘More than 300 000 people are there,’ said the Red Cross, and let them join and volunteer to defend the radical areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the authorities said that waves had arrived before the time of warning.
A amateur video shared in social media shows a man in the upper ets of a building that is desperate for people down the streets to warn them against the coming storm.
Get a minute later, meet a wall of water on the coast, and take with you buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the first video.
The sculptor and the tsunami cause the flow of electricity and cut the communication around Palu, something that made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of sending cargo flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other villages, reporting authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in town was restored to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was planning to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of arrivals in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very wrong.
Those added to the World Vision from Dongdraa have come safely to Palu city, and have set up a count in the backyard of their office. At the battle of the city, the entire damaged areas passed, said Doseba.
"You told me they saw many corrupt houses," he said.
It's very wrong.
As relief organisations begin their work by assisting those who have been affected by tsunamis, some complain that foreign relief workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations and their alternates cannot start the work before Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is a provincial crisis," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the state says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open for international emergency assistance, but they have not updated the status yet.’
It's evening again in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who still have no hope still have a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday a little good was done out of the bell.
On Sunday a woman was rescued from the rest of a collapsing building, how he had been arrested on the side of the dead mother's side for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, thirty-two of the missing paraglidants from the Asian games that had been completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Mandige said that one of those who were arrested in the Roa Roa hotel was his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to prepare for," he said.
Gendon told me he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the paraglidants from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he learned that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray hack, instead of two blue hackers.
"I guess that means the messages didn't come up," he said.
Two sets $26,750 from minibank in Newport, Level, USA
On Friday, $26,750 was stolen from a worker in Brink's company while he was about to complete a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The worker had just emptied a mini bank in the maintenance area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
When the worker was busy, "pull a man out behind the worker" and put a check with the money to deliver.
Witnesses observed several suspects while they were asleep in the house, according to the press report, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the raid.
If anyone has information about women involved, they should call the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes the name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had had Ye as the nickname for a minute, and used the name as the title on his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change in name came right before he would act on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on show after he resigned because of "emotional causes," said the program value.
In addition to being a summary of his current artist name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the famous Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye-- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, to confuse ours, everything.
The album reflects the women we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but in the year he declared his first name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with the West, has also changed the inscription to the name with and without links and large letters.
The future president of Mexico promises not to send the military to civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has the right to never send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador agreed on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza that he “will never use the military to undermine the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful demonstrations and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-oriented student towers spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has the right to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and open several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have given young people access to crime.
US should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who is working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the American government spoke about artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan four times, and aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation before 2030.
"A duplicate of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking at the next break in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
A double in funding can double the chances that the next major breach of artificial intelligence occurs in the United States, Lee told CBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» this month via the Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Synoving Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artistic intelligence in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system for artistic intelligence that hit the top ranked player of the Othello game, and later he was a member of Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognized earlier technology competitions organised by the US state, such as ‘Profence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge’ and asked how long the next competition should be, so that he will be with and identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have introduced excellent university students to work with artistic intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think that before artificial intelligence students get automatic retirement leave," he said.
The Council of State in China published its next generation plan for artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Association for Natural Sciences finance students from academic institutions, unlike the American National Sciences Association and other state organizations, to share money with American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Department established a joint centre for artificial intelligence, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academics, and the White House declared the formation of a Committee on artificial intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Sciences Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, there is no work on legislation on national safety and artificial intelligence for several months.
Macedonians smoke in public destruction to change their country's name
The Macedonian people are burning on Sundays in a folklore about to change their names to the Republic of Northern Macedonia to resolve a multiple ten-year conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Hellas, who has a province on behalf of Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement in the territory of their territory and has used vetto to vote against the membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments came to an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opposition argues that the exchange of names can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjerge Ivanov has said that he should not smoke in the populace, and a boycott has questioned the extent to which the populace comes to reach at least 50 percent of the population in order to be valid.
The question of the People's Republic of China is, "Are you a member of NATO and the EU and united in the agreement with Greece?"
Support players for the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of change of names is worth membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved itself after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to breathe for the future of this country, for the young people in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although smoking is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of smoking in order to make it decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds of its conclusions.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had occurred before 13:00.
Only 16 per cent had a smoke, contrary to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters had a smoke.
"I smoke for my children, we go to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a president of the capital city, Skopje.
The Ministry of State of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son Dushko are smoking in Sromika in the Macedonian People's Republic in order to change their names and open up to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boutique of the populace in front of the parliament in Skopje by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor land, but we are a people given to fear.
If they do not want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
Minister of State Zaev has said that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent employment opportunities.
"I hope that the majority will come to smoke for the change, of your 80 per cent of our citizens will be members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after having smoked.
He said that a "yes" result could be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future".
A survey of Macedonia's police research institute last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters are coming to participate in the referendum – something that is under the necessary heading.
Another measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 per cent of the choosers plan to smoke on Sundays.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent came to smoke yes.
In order to close the population gap, at least 50 percent of the population has to be broken down, plus one drop.
In the absence of the closure of the national flag, it may harm the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Bridgeton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Bridgeton defense that led to 2-0 sails for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero found it to look slightly light, when he scored 65 minutes.
The Argentine meal took a step on the mid-beam at the beginning of the sequence.
He ruled over three Brighton defense players and reached the open path.
Eventually, Aguero was surrounded by four green corners.
He came around one defense before he jumped over several others on the edge of the Brighton crime scene.
He came across a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English meal used its first patch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit Brighton's master Matthew Ryan with a straight shot into the right end of the target.
"Aguero is still shooting with his feet," said the City trainer Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them the first advantage in the Premier League.
That's what the target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He shot the ball on the left side of the van to Leroy Sane.
The truth stuck on the ball while he rented Sterling against the target.
The sky blue eats the ball split into the target right before it splits out of the bananas.
The city will play against Hoffenheim in the Championships League team phase at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhea-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play puzzles against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals removed from playoff content, there was little reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competition instincts, and hopes to take "mount" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to "playoff" for Rockies, which is playing with a game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies water at least 5-2 on National Friday evening, but looks forward to closing the first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, it’s worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the public and the other layer that is most likely to play at the highest level so far this year.
Who would not want to play with such conditions?"
It's still a woman to start in Nationals on Sundays, but it can be her Scherzer to "pitche".
Scherzer, which starts at 34 times, throws a "bulpen session" on Thursday and usually "piche" on Sundays.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 'strikeouts' in 220 2/3 'inhalations' this season.
Trump collects voters in West Virginia
The President recently referred to his first election for the summit, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in Inter-American elections.
"All we've done so far is on the game in November.
We're five weeks one of the most important whales in our life.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stand, but I jump around to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this forwarding, forwarding group with Democrats, you see that is happening right now.
And they're surprised that they're absolutely going to take power back, you see how much fun they're, how much they are.
They don't care about women they hurt, they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't have to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "meditate themselves and blockers".
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "sense and shame and shame and injustice."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who found his audience to fight.
“Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who played the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I wait--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer tolerated.
They're intolating against those who see what they're doing.
When the Momentum-activities in my local party rose to make me aware of it, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last one in a number of Labor MPs that have been told that I'm not welcome -- just to see what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because he protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being incompatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it comes to how important it is to drive responsible economies, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically had been disagreeing with earlier leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting at Nottingham East Laborour on Friday, we said, ‘We want to meet to be inclusive and productive’.
In the last eight years of mine like the Labour MP, the Friday meeting has been exactly like this.
The divergence of the day was not so, and the promise of 'sniller' policy was too much forgotten if it was followed in the whole way.
It has become more and more clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour and that every opinion is condemned by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party, when my colleagues wanted to be politically united with the expectation that I would reject and be united in matters I would never say to myself - whether it was a matter of national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly there is nothing to see what I am winning, I always get caught up in social media and people want me to leave while they criticize central policy and say that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I congratulate my colleagues, who receive gender discrimination and racially ills on every day, and who are still professional and do not go away.
One of the most exciting aspects of this period is how normal it has been to track politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn mentioned last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
At the same time, we no longer have a tolerance party that has something for everyone. For each of the miscellaneous proposals and for every change in the party rules, the party becomes smaller and smaller.
I've received many advice in the last two years from people who have said that I have to take it with fear and not be so loud, so maybe people will say "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I went into the lab, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was sitting on Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to fall together, so I wanted to have better public services for those who needed most - if it was as a municipal councillor or a government minister.
I've never forgotten my political views, nor in the previous choices.
No one in Nottingham East can have doubts about what I stand for and the woman of the current leaders I am not in agreement with.
I can only see to those who are at the forefront of the Friday proposal that when the country manages against a Brexit that will damage private, local and public services, I don't understand why people don't care to throw away their energy to ask questions at my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But actually, that's not the only message I've been right for Nottingham Momentum, but for the well-being of the selection, whether they're Labor voters or not: I'm proud to be fat, and I promise that no one can get me to leave or change my policy and prevent me from spending in the way I think it's best to cover everyone.

Age 38 - 17 Melrose: Unprejudiced Ayr goes to top in Scottish rubber
Two of his 'tries' may change the outcome a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr intended to win in this very interesting Tenent's Premiership struggle today.
They are now on the top of the ball as the only unconventional layer of all ten.
It was their sovereign defenses and the ability to take chances that gave the host and the trainer theirs, Peter Murchie, good reason to be nice.
"We've been tested in the last campaigns, and we're still unconventional, so I have to be quick," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "You know, they were smarter than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in 14 minutes, when Frazier Climo tried a "conversion", which put Ayr in front, but a gold card from the Scottish captain Rory Hughes from the Warriors lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted trip".
Climo found a penalty right before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solotry" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the other half well and Patrick Anderson's "three," which was "converted" by Baggot, reduced the scored coin with five points.
There was a long break when Ruarhh Knott was seriously injured and placed on the bar, and from the start of the re-fak Ayr forward through a "three" from Stafford McDowell, as Climate "converted".
The functioning captain for Ayr, Blair MacPherson, found gold short, and once again Melrose tried a 'unconverted Bruce Colvine try' at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The housekeeper played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card to take Climo without the ball from the criminal configuration, score MacPherson a "three".
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong his box kick and sent Gregor Henry away from his fifth "three".
The stars of the Scottish series, Still Game, start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in conjunction with partner Greg Hemhill.
The duo has announced that the coming 9th season comes to be the last, and it seems as if Kirnan plans life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of the Afförmorn Limited.
The Scotch player won't comment on the cause, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper noted that Kiernan would be involved in the "progressive restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes that the right will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Clear patrolling marine headquarters and La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flag.
Marine bases from the island of Titicaca to Amazona have been discovered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right.
and the obligation to return to it.»
In western Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastal country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict of resources in the 1800s. They long after crossing the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than many decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October, after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has drive, sense and is united, and looks forward to a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to see the Court of Justice from the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of Justice in Haag will support Bolivia's demands, and that Chile, after ten years of negotiations, will provide an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia - who seeks to be elected again the next year - has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
"Now we get back to the Pacific soon," he said late in August.
But some analysts don't want the court to come to allow Bolivia to have access to the sea - and some would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice has not been able to transfer the Chilean territory to Bolivia and has insisted that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's judgment comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have been far from Bolivia's point of view, they have done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been overcome by the current Bolivian administration,’ Zárate said.
Morales, with his combative rhetoric, has killed what was meant by Chile's goodwill, said Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations for a time, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the problem position after this.
The two countries have not replaced Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who is Bolivia’s representative in Haag, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "set the line at 139 years of independence and also win both," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime problem to win riots.
‘Bolivia will never grant the right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
"The domain is an opportunity to see what we need to do to hide the past."
North Korea says they won't release the nuclear weapon if they can't trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to withdraw, if they cannot trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up on their commitments during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri’s comments came at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pomepo seemed to want to start again that his confirmed nuclear disarmament diplomat, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
It says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be subject to sanctions if the United States continues to oppose any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington warns against joining a possible declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang giving up first.
Both Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to building and that the country is most likely to view its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plan to visit Pyongyang next month to conduct the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that a massive major plague is the last resistance to a hand-held close to you
If you want to upgrade your host collection or block your solar system completely, you do not need to look up any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered a number of large and special main posters in their SS19 collection. The main platform is founded by audiences under the Moteveca in Paris.
The highest unencumbered hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent the shocking creatures their right to the catwalk.
The most large-scale beach was an overcrowded, leg of Valentino-hatt with a birdlike, at the bridge covering the models' heads.
There were also other oversized accesses under the moteshowet, including a yellow-brown vassmone, a trollman hat, and also with an ananas--but they're not designed to hold your head warm.
Thom Browne also closed a collection of weirder masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had leaves that were sedated together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than skin Couture.
One of the creatures looks like thicker equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a piece of ice in the kitchen.
If you look like this enormous dramatism, you can just look at yourself.
Anti-experts track that huge hacks come for the sal in a handy neighborhood near you.
The over-dimensional attacks come right after La Bomba, the beam with the 60 cm wide brake that has been seen on tracks from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The cultural brand behind the highest unencumbered hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk - a street bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried it.
Strandbeska, with the color of hot orange and frozen top with a white skin handle, was the most striking part of Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection under fashion jackets in Paris.
The Kjendis style list Luke Armitage commented to the F.D.: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the mote shops next summer - the designer has made so much impression that I doubt that it is going to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge · Global Voices
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with outstanding exam results, something that will only be enhanced by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these students work, represented by the Scottish Council for Self-Scholars (SCIS), offering the best services to the students and parents.
Self-restraints have the aim of leading their students to higher education, careers and role as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a step-by-step pension, we see that modern languages are popular wafers in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak with him in your language, his message will be to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when building relationships and trust from other countries.
By looking at the results of exams from year to year, we can see that languages are at the top of the equations with the highest strengths for self-esteem.
A total of 68 per cent of students who took advantage of language were A.
Data collected from SCIS' 74 member schools show that 72% of the students found A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who took German, 69% of those who took French, and 63% of those who took Spanish also found A.
This shows that Scotland’s self-sustained sculptors support advanced languages as vital qualities, such as children and young people who are absolutely coming to need in the future.
Languages that are optional are treated as equivalent to STEM-faga (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the pensuma for self-sustained shoes and other places.
A study carried out by the UK addendum and properties selection in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of employers are able to complete the job as a result of lack of language skills in applicants.
Therefore, it is more and more important with language in school to lead young people to work.
With multiple language skills, these qualities are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what careers a young person may choose, if they have learned another language, they have a good advantage in the future with such a quality.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically provide a multi-lingual benefit in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-percent, 15 per cent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to speak more languages, especially languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, there is always a need to change when it comes to the language they teach in.
Many scholars focus on classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, which is judged as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between themselves, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-sustainers are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will guide children and give them the qualities they need to close, regardless of what future challenges they face.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, language is vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be referred to as ‘international communication characteristics’.
Self-sustained sculptors will continue to offer this option and thus offer diversity and high competence for Scotland’s young people.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Self-Sustained Sculptures
LeBron Debates in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is soon over for fans who are happy to see LeBron James debuters at the Los Angeles Lakes basketball club.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the race race race camp on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the length of time he should play has not been determined yet.
"It comes to be more than one minute and less than 49," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers Reporter, Mike Trudell, argues that James is most likely to play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the spring season.
"I don't need a driving game at this stage of the race to make me ready," he said.
Trump West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a campaign campaign at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five planned stops of the coming week, including stops in friendly cities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the consent of the local authorities to choose to fill the empty position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when votes are due in November.
How long should Trump be in West Virginia at night, and how can you see it on the web?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. in the evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably take up this week's summits of the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh, which was spent on sexual abuse charges, with a expected standstill voice from the Senate on the waiting period until one week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main objective of this chain of collections is to help the Republicans meet in November and get some time.
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that these five collections are right next week to "open up volunteers and allies who the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the Representative House", according to Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," says a speaker for the Trump campaign who refuses to be informed of Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening collection can bring back support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday becomes the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been asked for the terms of reference.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a promise in terms of meaning," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows magic for fighting to keep hope alive on Sundays
After three separate sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup is inside.
The moving pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport, but one that players really trust, and never more than competitions like these.
So where would they know that the moment is now?
"You had a six-point rent, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he went away for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading to twelve more games.
Americans, as Spieth sails, know that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have much to encourage from, at least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has us mortal from tea to grass and rent after judgment.
The gulp of the holiday was higher when his round continued, looking for an important spot to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had two down after two.
His foot that won those battles on 15 was met with a similar cry, the type that tells you that he means the American layer is not out of this.
“You have actually just got deep and worried about your own fight,” said Spieh.
That's all the rest of these players have left now.
18 holo to create a tag.
The only players with more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unforgettable story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sweet couple are four and can't make any mistakes.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who would not shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also checked on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and returned nine (the last one on a 18-holon road) on Friday morning.
The course, and the way their energy looks to move both to and from this exciting, engulfed audience, celebrates that they are players to be killed on Sunday, and it would not be more popular players to predict a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
At the same time, they're both in different halls.
Talks about European honours are still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the four-year-old cell of the morning, when he was married to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, buried the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came near to get out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely the interaction between opponents, advise them, and advise them not to give and the way in which a strategy can change a perspective.
Europe has played better than a lot so far and takes a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the power to fight as someone, especially the state, had doubts about it.
Europe takes 10-6 leagues in Ryder Cup finals
Europe will have a sound advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursome-cammers with a 10-6 league over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two winners over a range of Tiger Woods to take his fight so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side led to keep the trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a wrong American side in the morning fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in foursomes and had two fights, but they could not get the underscored.
Jim Furyks' side needs eight points from the 12 single campaigns on Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European Rocky to win four points on row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an optimum weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from the open door in four battles in Ryder Cup history.
After knut Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs, they gave themselves so great a chance to hit a loose Woods and American Rocky Bryson Dechambeau with a more than 5 and 4.
Woods, who went through two fights on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliantness, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven on row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 download by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - organized one and three in the world.
Europe did not yet realize everything they wanted on a jubilant, blue days in the south of Paris.
Three times big wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 saying about Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in Foursomes when they lost two holes in the open.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history, a layer has come back from a four-point sequence and went into a single, even if it contains Furyk's page just to draw to keep the trophies.
After having our next best in two days, however, it looks like a Sunday moment attack will be outside them.
North Korea does not seem to be able to relax completely without trust
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue to increase the failure of the United States, the country would not give up its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Power of Control that North Korea had taken "a significant step" to improve relations in the last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and Missile Tests, demonstrated the nuclear test city and does not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't get anything similar back from the United States," he said.
"In addition to our trust in the United States, it will not be our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible for us to give up ourselves alone."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has filed several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phasa" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take steps gradually, showed its rejection significantly by not rejecting unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first meeting once between a sit-in American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the 'building of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula' while Trump promised security for North Korea's safety.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to facilitate the adoption of international sanctions in North Korea.
‘USA insists on 'building nuclear power first’ and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective of force, and they oppose themselves even with the ‘declaration of peace’ said Ri.
«There is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when sanctions continue, our guilt will only increase."
No mention was made of the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the US President expressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
The Minister attended three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, last five months and added: "Show the party in this invitation to the reduction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the collapse of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now."
However, the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different from earlier, when he told the General Assembly in the United States that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the American country after President Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide orders.
Trump, who in the first instance threatened to "totally harm" North Korea, accused Kim of taking steps to disarm him, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to be held in place for North Korea to break its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time for this, and he said, "If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the actions taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N. his Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's links must continue to be firmly established and without fail until we get the complete, complete, verifiable deviation of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to combat Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the side line of the General Assembly in the F.N. and said he would visit Pyongyang again the next month to hold a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year already, but his last trip was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later he condemned North Korea to come with "gangster-like requirements."
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon this month to demolify a missing city and an atomic complex if the United States did "the same action".
He said Kim had told him that the "compared actions" he sought were security guarantees such as Trump's law in Singapore, and made progress towards normalization of the relationship to Washington.
Harvard students take the course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University has been involved in getting more sleep for all students, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture that goes out to study in caffeinerus all night. It will show that one uses caffeine to keep awake all night to study.
Academic student found that high school students often have little supervision when it comes to all the most basic - how one should take care of itself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, develops the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep failure on learning.
At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why should I be told this by age?"
He said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping-- something surprising to me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time in the year, explains what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves the general triumph of the dear.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the managing director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had received a severed sleep during the week.
The short course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom where students click on coffee cups, gardens, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness, and how important it is with night routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart disease, brain damage, depression and cancer.
A map over the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students once.
But we fear they have the right to know -- exactly as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, let Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of sustainability of the day still exists, he said, and let modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that sleeplessness is a growing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--and by avoiding going up to weight, since sleeplessness sees the brain in soft mode and makes them constantly soft.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after having our student at his first year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to get a course for the entire camp.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all medical students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised that the students should consider setting up an alarm when they are to go to bed, and in addition to when they are to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "white light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can turn the internal clock into a total, something that leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Many targets give Gerrards men down
Rangers went on a new floor on the street when Dolly Menga his installation sent Steven Gerrard's outstanding page to a 1-0-cap at Livingstone.
The Ibrox page was on display after taking its first winner on the side of the 4-1-triumphant of St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt only caused Gerrard's second download of 18 matches, and gave eight points, one round under the League of Premier League, Hearts.
Many slots to seven minutes before half time, and a Ranger configuration with no inspiration never seemed to look like it.
While Rangers now bends down to six places, Livingston climbs to the third and lies behind Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there may be further problems in storage for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to deal with an injury in the head, after a object which was visible has fallen from the outer page.
Gerrard made eight changes in the layer as he ran Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dreamy shot last week, and he would have been delighted with the way the well-being of his drawing took the velvet on his opponents on each shift.
Rangers may have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have score after only two minutes when Menga's first installation sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player failed in his contest.
A long break from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far from the facility.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in the game played in the last three rounds.
Alfredo Morellos knew that he would have been punished on the 20-metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but judges Steven Thomson gave up wanting for the Colombians.
Ranger's only clear two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was almost worried by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a stupid shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game rules, no one can deny that they understood it only because of the "scot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep deathball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who became fun to pull Menga out for a simple finish.
Gerrard pointed at the stage as if he exchanged Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange caused an immediate effect when the guard created a lock for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly race forward to block.
But Livingstone continued to list the host to play exactly that game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending long shots on long shots.
Holt's layer could have increased the lease at the end, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacobs from doing it, until Lithrow left a long install from the corner mark.
The reservation to Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new requirement of punishment when he supported Jacobs, but again Thomson took note of it.
Almanac: The Founder of the Gegiller
And now one side of our "Sday Morning" Germanic: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and VI REKNAR ... the day when he, who would become physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a detection that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger speaker.
As a scientific tool, since then, the Geiger dealer has also been a carrier in the pop culture, such as in the 1950s “Bells of Coronado” film, with the seemingly unlikely low-boy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man says, ‘What is it all in the world?’
Rogers: "It's a Geiger dealer, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you look at these direct phones, you can actually increase the effects of atoms coming from the radioactivity in the mineral.»
Evans said, "Yes, let's live!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the discovery that makes his name live on.
The new cancer vaccine can learn the immune response to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune response to "see" red cells and kill them.
Vaccines learn the immune response to red cells, as part of treatment
The method involves removing immunity from a patient and changing them into the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers and then clean up.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman who was treated with vaccines, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory, so that they can see a protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-register the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 «run the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the removal of immunosuppressants from patients and to "learn" the way they target cancer cells have worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West hosts a Pro-Trump diaribe, introduced a MAGA-lue, after visiting TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It wasn't so good.
Kanye West was picked up in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an outstanding performance where he rocked his president, Donald Trump, and said he wanted to vote in 2020.
After taking his third song for the night, called Ghost Town, where he had a make American Great Caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and returned support to Trump.
"So many times I have spoken to a man who is a white, and they say, 'How can you be like Trump, who is a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL starts the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood stars broke his testimony to the Senate's decision on the charges of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not sent, it was captured to the West by his drawn cargo to social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to hang West with the installation.
West had also complained to the public that he had a difficult backstage due to his head.
"Dei moves me to look at the scene.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
Move it!
And then they say that I'm in a weakened place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the weakened place?" says he would "take the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to go ahead?
Try love.»
His comments led to pressure at least two times from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed deeply interested, reported Variety, with a person who told the publication: “The whole study was dead.”
West was captured as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuses many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West found support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as twitter: "For one of the most courageous souls: TAKK FOR YOUR STAR OPP MOT PROBLEM."
But the speech show-advertant Karen Hunter twitter that the West “was just like him and it’s totally fantastic.”
"But I chose NOT to hire anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") which I fear awakens and asks for ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we're doing, too.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now “formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in photos of Diddy, and known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrapir, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, has changed the name to a symbol and then the artist as previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes out against violent masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the winning role of Jon Snow in HBO's selected middle age fantasie series Game of Thrones.
But the score player, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, and says that such roles on the screen often lead to young guys feeling they have to be proud to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he means that something has gone crazy and asked how one should address the problem with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, recently married to her Game of Thrones player Rose Leslie, and 31, admitted that he knows "ganske strong" to solve the problem.
"I personally doubt that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we taught men when they grew up, when it comes to the problem we now see?"
Kit means that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very human characteristics.
He continued: 'What is born of birth, and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets, what makes young men feel that they must be this special side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
'Cause it's clear that something's gone crazy for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones runners or followers when the series ends in summer, and sees him “complete with hit marks and horses”.
From November, Kit will play in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The scorer recently concluded that he was looking at the meeting with the woman's Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family and my life to go on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the one that belonged to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy prize prized fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people live in the country, with health problems.
If 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
All of these new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV this way, which was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health personnel at a conference in the Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the China LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ personnel is considered to be more widespread.
In view of the conservative values in the country, it has been concluded that 70-90% of men with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has legalized universal access to HIV-medicine as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add fake information from the GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiration theories'.
USA Rep. Maxine Wars condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had provided personal information on three Republican senators on the Wikipedia side of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserts that claims have been pedalized by “extrem-right fly” research and web pages.
"Layers, lies and more presumptuous lies," said Waters in a tweet on Twitter.
The information provided included home addresses and telephone numbers for the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill under a Senate panel stating the charges of sexual abuse against Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The play came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying sources of installation was linked to Water's office and issued the information to a member of Waters' staff, reported Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
‘One of my additions - which has been compromised by its identity, personal information and security as a result of these false and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is entirely false and an absolute lie.’
The news of Water was quickly criticised on the network, among others from former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This connection is here," Fleskir wrote.
“This means that he does not have a temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be guilty.
They must not be empty.
You do not have to ask me questions for reason.
They must be gentle and peaceful.’
Fleischers appeared to compare Water's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judges Kavanaugh, who were accused of critics to be watching for themselves during the day of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take over Water's place in the middle of the street, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"True if it's true," he tweeted.
In the meantime, Waters said that her office had warned "to correct the governing powers and the legal entities of these false claims.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are dismissed,’ continued him, ‘and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts which are harmful and dangerous to each and one of my employees.’
Johnny English strikes again - spy count of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to watch for Brexit branding in all new films with a British angle, and it seems to be relevant for this recovery of Johnny English's action-Committie Spof-France - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was reopened in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-vironial satirical satiricals, which deal with how openly we are, become the new export potential in the country?
In any case, the great, incompetence Johnny English with the rubber chain has for another time renewed its freedom to fuck things up--the name of his signaling more than anything else that he is a broad complication for filmmakers in non-English countries.
He's obviously the patient, secret agent who's been in his habit of spreading a little glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a Dash by Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple melody to the Firevogne, the theme under the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystical man Atkinson once played in the now hidden Barclaycard TV ads, something that followed chaos in the back.
There's one or two fine eyebrows in this last JE outlet.
I love Johnny English who's approaching a helicopter while he was dressed in a restroom from the middle age while the rotorblade hits his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor is quite weak and remarkable, especially since "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The Humor is known as if he's right to the children instead of the adults, and for me Johnny England's shooting accident is not as noticeable and focused as Atkinson's replication clause wears in the person in Bean.
The permanent present proposal is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-home network of spy networks, which reveals the identity of all British agents in the area, for the transmission of the agent's work - a rather minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last street for a state minister who is a pumpkin and warlord figure, which already has a completely broken-up of politics: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it's not so much in the script to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each active spy has a debt, she has to get someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works who learns by some elegant establishment, but gives informal lessons about how one should work undercover: a couple fine whites here, since English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for spying.
English will be sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunite with its former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved to a volunteer job, an overcrowded role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become terrible galleys in Hennar Majesty's Secret Services is too far back in the full meeting with Olga Kurylenkos wakes five fatalities, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Minister of State threatened the expansion of the charismatic technology of billionaire, claiming that he could solve the UK's data problem: the careless Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start traveling by race-like wild games: dressed as servers, seeing the boys at a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and swim on the Volta lightboard; and English settles quite anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get acquainted with the inner house of Voltas.
All stops are certainly drawn out to the last sequence, but as loving and disciplined as it is, it's quite a lot of children's TV over the whole.
Ganke's moderated stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't be thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to prepare a plan for the English people to work for a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbys Labour Party now assesses a radical plan that wants the British to work for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the company manager will send further savings made through the intelligent (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day of rest.
That would add a three-day weekend -- but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase the benefits of workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the change in the economy.
An older source from Labor told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the year change.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a quarter-day work week is a desire that fits into the nearby party to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as to the party's industrial strategy.'
The working party would not be the first to approve such an idea, when Greene Party promised a quarter-day work week in its 2017 election campaign.
The ambition is for the eyelid, however, not approved by the entire Work Party.
A speaker from the Labour Party said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and it is not evaluated by the party.'
John McDonnell’s Skull Chancellor used the previous week’s workshop to strengthen his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was firm in his determination to withdraw the power from the "inspired directors" and "profetors" of the government companies.
The plans of the shadow canal also mean that current actors in the waterway cannot get back all their efforts when a Government of the Working Party is able to make a "warming" because of perceived misappropriation.
He also has established plans to set up employees in corporate governance and set up the Inclusive Ownership Fund (Including Property Fund) to provide 10 per cent of the equity in private sector initiatives, which would receive annual exchanges of up to 500 £, about 5000 kroner.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told on the 60-minute TV program about the FBI's research in Kavanaugh's ability to change their thoughts
The FBI's investigation of complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has provided a final agreement on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of how the Agency could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be sent on Sunday, Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would get them to disagree.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the wall in the right, I said, I have spoken to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the claim came out and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, determined, extended.’
Graham's voice, however, seems to be in stone.
"I have raised my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamic commitment to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Board strongly rejected it, "la Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all his names could not be confirmed.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new about it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosted for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has a huge impressive setting of stars acting and a similar impressive order; end up in poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flocking to the great Central Parks, not only to benefit from seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes' actions, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free image of the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP image), artists must complete a set of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send e-mail to a world player, call a phone call or other meaningful means to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been 12 years ago to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert really a way to convince people to ask for a call for action, or just another case of such a "clickivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen notes that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by its supporters and participated in and pressed on a number of different objectives.
These actions have contributed to the ability of world leaders to publish commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect life to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and notices due to the shares, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe means have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are obliged to “help the child achieve its full potential”; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the end of the country’s sub-entry after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national administrations and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of subordination to a footnote in history," said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulllman, a publication under a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after they had taken more than 5,000 actions to require Britain to be better fed to mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will now reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, they ask, "What can you be sure that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens answered: "It will be a long and difficult battle - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great citizens and the anti-participation forces lead us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée is among the actors who are taking part in the annual event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the ‘blocked’ flag to prevent Russian energy exports - Internal Secretary of State
Washington may ‘if necessary’ because of its fleet in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has disappeared, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's exposure to Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a challenge to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to spend energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do it.
"The US has this ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seas are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy is not wasted on the market," he said.
Zincke spoke to the participants about the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that presents itself as a "voting to the energy user" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution of Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel," he said, while pointing to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come from the Trump Administration to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this connection, servicemen in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to transfer Germany to withdraw from the ‘adapted’ North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a ‘patch’ in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only motivated by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I hope that we share the position that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers will be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US Department has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country disturbs our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “run hard” to stand as presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would take a "precise look" to stand as president's candidate after the mid-term election.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider standing as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman on the top," he said, according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will take a thorough assessment of the position as President's candidate.’
Warren joined President Donald Trump during the Council meeting and said that he ‘leads this country in the wrong direction’.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Warren has our step in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey conducted on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own choices do not seem to be expected to be a candidate in 2020.
51 per cent of the "probably" Massachusetts gentlemen said that the senator should not stand as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty percent supported such a candidate.
The study showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
By the way, he was going to judge officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post traumatic stress management) at Donald Trump's collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after having been pregnant in September.
He was arrested and sentenced to a election at home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, makes me contact other families who are taught by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," said he to the audience at a collection of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his "elephant in the room" and said that his son and other war veterans "come back a little bit, they come back here, they come back and laments about the respect for the country they and their soldiers and refugees and all the other soldiers have made for the country, there is."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was liable for physical choice in the home against a woman, to disrupt a report on the choice in the home and the preservation of a weapon while he was Russian, according to Dan Bennett, a speaker for the Vasilla Politi Department.
18 states, D.C. aid challenge for new asylum policy
The Act of State and District in Colombia supports a legal challenge to a new American policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing from re-election or election at home.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district introduced a friend-of-the-law short Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions corresponds to the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) did not open in August against the federal policy.
She said that her partner 'and the selected re-commissioning sons' abused her, but American embezzlers rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of American asylum seekers, which nations face cross-border problems with their faces and choose in the home.
The new American asylum policy was re-vised by a 2014 immigration decree, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled from their home to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a surprise Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, food and international law".
‘Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and thus to prevent conflict with this principle,’ said a friend-of-the-law shortly.
Lawyers continue to argue that policies that deny immigration access are damaging the US economy, and it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "requires necessary jobs".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who fled abuse and re-election in June.
‘Asyl is available for those who leave their home because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,’ said the session on 11 June in its policy proclamation.
Asyl never meant to solve all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while the death penalty doubles in the head to find survivors
For survival, the situation was increasingly serious.
"It was very expensive," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who was the youngest of the febrile baby's disease at an evacuation center in the corrupt city, Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find.’
Residents have been observed on the march back to their ruined homes, where they search through damaged property and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the sick house that was damaged by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, was filled.
Some of the damage, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and guilt, slept outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside because of still strong complaints.
Társer filled his eyes while he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake that swept the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter in the fifth phase.
"It was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, “he told Haris to Associated Press, and let his family be in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador owes China for "mobbing" with propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a 4-page publication in an American daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the US and China, the US Ambassador against China Beijing owes it to use the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid deposit in the Des Moines Register - state Iowas's largest salsavis - after he owes China to try to mix in the United States Congress on 6 November, a debt China refuses.
Trump's claim that Beijing tried to mix in American elections, noted what American servicemen told Reuters was a new phase in a climbing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign administrations to place advertising in order to support trade, Beijing and Washington are for the time being locked up in an increasing trade war that has seen them in environments taxing each of their imports.
In the early years of the trade war, Chinese and American exporters were designed to meet in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trumps, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
“Kina”, wrote Branstad in a statement in the Sunday Des Moines register, “doubling now by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In its communication of propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the American cold tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting a paid ad in the Des Moines Registry,” wrote Branstad.
"On the contrary, by the aviskios go down here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic path, given that the media is under the constant dust of the Chinese Communist Party "he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most advanced newspapers rejects the offer to publish" his article, even though he didn't say what to a newspaper.
Republicans present female voters lead the middle term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning analysts.
Since many top republics are state-owned and defend high-ranking elected Brett Kavanaugh in a meeting with several charges of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they might see a retreat, especially from women, in the coming mid-term elections.
The skills around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have recorded that they have already wanted to proceed with a vote.
These things cannot be ignored, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last glimpse of an FBI investigation will be enough to defeat the selection.
"Women don't come to forget what happened yesterday - they don't come to hide it tomorrow morning, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, singing protestors "November came!" while they demonstrated in the hall until late that day when the republicans, who are taking the court committee, chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination following the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation come to be outside the diagram," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participating political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already our height, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among female voters in the cities and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who, while not like the President, often do not vote.’
Even before Ford’s public duty as detailed in the statement of the claims for sexual abuse against alleged higher rights mentioned, it was proposed to analyse that a withdrawal could be followed if the Republicans were to press the constitutional warrant.
‘This has been a confusing route for GOP,’ said Michael Steele, former head of the National Republican Committee, earlier in previous weeks, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the ground, but also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that is involved in selecting Democrats, focusing on the new channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little confused about women to believe in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony burden, with a little more sides with the latest.
A new meaning measurement from YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or dangerously abused Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or dangerously abused Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they suspected that Kavanaugh was dangerous or definitely lying under his testimony burden, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI investigates for time claims made by Ford, and in addition at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
For the witness of the board of directors of the Senate during the previous week that Kavanaugh had completely overemphasized her in an age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest-ranking woman showed her to her while they participated in a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Webplans Founder to Start a New Internet to Meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, discoverer of the World Wide Web, launchs a launch that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project for technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source code platform Solid.
Solid lets users choose where data is stored and what people have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee claimed that the concept of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historical sight."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, memo lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about the personal website is that it's completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should take resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with a contract to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week, technology developers can be able to explain in the future their own decentralised app with the tools available on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine fair
The only English church goddess who won a Victoria course during the first world war as a fighter has been holiday in his home 100 years ago.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengle and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a skirmisher four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial was delivered by his two children on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilling symbolic", that the stone would be handed down just 100 years after the prestigious performance of his superior.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 “through a very thick cloud and under heavy fire from the field and machinery.”
He later jumped up to the front line, and with the 'greatest gallanter' led the line forward before he hung up with a field host and shot out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German skirmisher on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his best father were "nothing I know I could never live up to, but something I'm proud of."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very proud of playing a role in the parade, and let 'the value of a real is shown by the support given by many people'.
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they found Peppa Gris in the city
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206, so you won't see the main transaction.
The account from San Jose contains 13 battles, including six on the main map and was shown alive through night in Britain on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing to meet each other, the winners in the UK were reassessed when the decks changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little imposed after they had kept awake for the past few hours especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described a switch to the drawing industry for children as “a kind of sick talk”.
"It is public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the content was not such, they had to switch to the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
‘Peppa-grissen’, ‘yes’.
Bellator, president of the company Scott Coker, said they should work with planning to include British winners in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think I think we can figure it out," said Coker.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out of this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it went over, there were many scriptures that went forward and back, and all were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you the next time it doesn't happen.
We held it up to five games instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to survive to the fan, and we just went over.
It is an unfortunate situation.»
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew herself "underground" due to sexuality
The Olympic stud Tom Daley says that in growth he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality -- but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't wake up before he went on the front floor that "not all are like me."
When he spoke on the first radio 4 desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about his homofile rights to give other “hope”.
He said to be a parent who made him less concerned about winning the OL.
The sustained reporter in long-term show, Kirsty Young, has taken free months due to illness.
What could appear as an exception to Lavernes' first program, Daly said that he knew everyone else who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to equal men and girls."
He said: "From this day on, knowledge has come to me of less than knowledge and knowledge of different things, our true things that have given me strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "noko," he said, so he didn't shoot everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-hang bronze Olympic medallion has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at the year's Common Peace Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew himself well who could live up without interruptions and wanted to give others a “hope”.
The three-fold World Master said it was to be a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daley married Oscar's friend, 20 years older than he, in the past, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
'When you go through so much in such a young age'--he went to his first 14-year-old OL and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find someone in the same age who had experienced similar heights and descents.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that the whole "his" perspective had changed.
"If you'd asked me earlier, deal with everything if I need to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know what, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
I'm an Olympic gold medal for Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't wait for him that you didn't come to be on the first floor," he said.
"I kept going when he stopped smoking, and it wasn't before he had actually stopped smoking and he was dead as I finally realized that he was not incapacitated," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the OL in 2012 and water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to bow before a home audience in an Olympic game where no better knowledge was found," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Stolt by Heather Small - who had vibrated with him in the construction of OL and gave him still gashed.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mikkelson at the bank on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will put a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th. Ryder Cup game, but he has to say again to avoid that it's an accident.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year-old event for a record 12 times, was placed on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk in the golf course of the day in Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, split the five times the big winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game before counting for the hope of correcting what he laments.
Never the most competent long-distance slots. The 48-year-old is the best time to meet the long-distance slots on the tree, the French front of the ball outside if the golf player doesn't have enough hits.
And if even bananas are not scary enough, Michaelson meets in the ninth fight Sunday, the precise British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has fought with Roky Tommy Fleetwood to win all four campaigns this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single campaigns, get to a hot start, mickelson's struggle can be quite decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could overcome many others.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a beating on my back and left the arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these designs in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I saw more for me, but it was like that, and it was like that we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will kill Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup camps that are played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely match the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 losings and seven-parts, even about Furyk, said that his neighborhood gave some intangible properties to the layer.
"He's morossam, he's sarcastic, contenting, likes to keep a moro with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storage room," he explained.
"I suppose the younger players had been happy that they had found a connection with him and this week, which was ridiculous to see.
He contributes much more than just to play."
European Captain Thomas Björn knows that a great deal can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knew from experience that a significant lease in the last few days' singles in Ryder Cup can easily be made into an unfavourable trip.
Denmark made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama battle, where a sidemap of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only over the target of the nose led with the smallest margins, wins 141⁄2-131/2.
"You continued to remember that we had a large rent on Valderrama; we had a large rent on Brooklyn where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we had water, but only so much," said Björn, after he had seen Classa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the board that this isn't over.
You're going to complete the opening tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
This is not over when you're at a table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophie, and that's where the focus is going to be.
I've said all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's going on on on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Glad to see how his players have acted on a golf course, La Björn added: "I would never take the victory on the record.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is the individual benefits that come forward, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out individually, you're gonna test out your ability as golf players.
It is the message you need to send to the player; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have left your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjørn, the number Jim Furyk will be on display after his players have to perform better individually than those who did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who get three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been both the end of the snow operations in the last few days, after being part of the winning building in Brooklyn before he ends up losing Europe when he took "Miraclelet in Medina."
"I remember every jubilant word of it," he said in response to being asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players in battle in the last day.
“We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to start with the quick start you saw on Brooklyn, which you saw on Medinah.
When a boat is taken, there's a lot of pressure on the middle of the camps.
We look up our line-up correspondingly and start the guys in a way that is well known, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned to try to rent the fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter of the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I hope it covers the whole way," Bjorn said about his vald of singles.
Germany's new warships, one more time
The latest release of the German sea would have been ordered in 2014 to replace the old warships from the so-called wartime, but it will not be there for at least the next year due to the failure of the German maritime system and the loss of costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the lead ship for the new Baden-Wuertmberg class, has now been set up for the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-Avisai, who quotes a military speaker.
The vessel would have ended up at the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery caused the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship the Marine Response was ordered back in 2007, as a substitute for the old Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a strong cannon, a number of anti-fly and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, which reduce radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to replace the latest requests for up to two years away from the doors at home.
However, the continuous delay means that the banana warships, which, of course, allows Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be updated when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines in four, when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Bluehm & Voss plant in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship unusable if they were placed on a campaign assignment.
Software error was particularly important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a man on about 120 seas - only half of the labour force on older Bremen frigates.
It also proved that the ship is dramatic, something that reduces performance and limits the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in other world wars.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the whole project - including human training - is also becoming a problem.
It has been said to have reached a shrinking €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the introduction €2.2 billion (EURO)
The problems related to the latest patents will be particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense election to the German Parliament, admitted that the fleet ‘has almost ended up on distribution-compliant ships’.
The officer said that the problem had been built over time because old ships had been decomposed, but no replacement ship had been delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Dissemination of Secret Life to Flagermus
A new research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highland aims to discover how the flag-museries use the landscape in hunting for food.
It is hoped that a new light will be shed on the behaviour of the unique flight pathogens and will contribute to the correction of future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano pipettes and also the brown long-term and Daubenton flagermus at Inverwe Gardens in West Ross.
Special contractors will be placed in important places around their property to track flag-moving activities throughout the season.
NHS supplements and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests using Handheld detectors.
An expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag mouse conversations and what arts do.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape picture of behavioural damage.
Rob Dewar, a naturalist consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will find out what area of habitats, natural homes, which are the most important of the flags and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work as a purchase of eggs and how it is best to maintain at the same forest area for flaggermus and other related species.
Flags of the population of Scotland and over the United Kingdom have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects rest areas and loss of habitats/bullages.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flue paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on pets.
Flagermus is not really blind.
But because of the nightly jackals, it's still more useful than the eye-catches when it comes to catching substitute animals.
They use a sophisticated eco-calculation technique to detect errors and obstacles in the air route.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important buildings and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, makes the flags very serious.
There are ten train experts who regularly conduct studies, the inspection of the rest of the camp, and several times save lives.
The organisation has also created the first and only dedicated flagmus reserve in Scotland at the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag muarets.
Owner David Thompson wins that property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Thrave we have a great area for flaggermus," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veterans and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about flags that are still unknown, so that the work we do here and on other property will help us to understand more about what they need to work on."
He underlines the importance of checking for flags before carrying out maintenance within property, since it is possible that the endless destruction of a single bulpa can kill up to 400 female and young women, and perhaps expel a whole local population.
Flagermus is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, torture, or disrupt the rest of the dead.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officers for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
He said, "We still have much to learn about our flags and too many of the species of ours we do not know how the people of the desert are going."
Ronaldo rejects government claims in the lawyer's search for German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has noted the charges against himself as “false news”, and he says that people “want to be proud” by using his name.
His lawyers are set to search the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus are responsible for selecting an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's supposed to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported There Spiegel on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, to his 142 million followers only hours after the charges are “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Those who said today, false news, will win five times the Gullball winner into the camera.
"You want to market yourself by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be known by my name, but it is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good, "make the player to and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to investigate The mirror of the claims, which they have called "an inexhaustible report on suspects within the area of personal protection", according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in a amount of serious crime is, something that is likely to be one of the most serious crimes in personal affairs in recent years.”
The alleged event is said to have been found in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After attending a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga took back to the player's room, which one claims to have chosen her anal, according to the document submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at a hospital, but later he was also referring to a comparison because he felt “screaming from retreading” and was concerned about "when becoming a public audjuka."
The 34-year-old wins that he is now trying to change the bus when he continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on his way to be with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a € 100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will always be angry' to lose image producers
In the case of the United Kingdom’s failure to maintain its status as world-famous before the production of images after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese image manufacturer said that the effect of border crossings in the case of a Brexit non-agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avenues - produced nearly 150,000 cars in four, as much as 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain goes from the EU at the end of March, we see the production stop on our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have been afraid to leave the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW is to be judged that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford in one month after Brexit.
The most important concerns relate to the risk of supply chains in the case of a Brexit non-agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the borders that the industry can lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's value of inventory on its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU is "highly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We must have a deal. We want to have the best deal that I will allow, as I say, not only to use the success today, but for us to catch this possibility," he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
“Show from not only Toyota, but other producers are that we must be absolutely able to continue what we have a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not determine how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it would warn that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the United Union at the plant, said his members are more occupied by: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
One speaker to the government said: "We have presented a precise and dangerous plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Drump meeting with Rosenstein can be expected again, see White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with Miss Rod Rosenstein could be “pressa back one week” as the battle against the top-right named Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work with Special Council Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian electoral mix, links between Trump and Russia, and potential obstacle to the president's justice.
Karvyt Trump will sail up the general of the sound advocates or not, and thus endanger Mueller's self-sustaining, has given food to Washington soldiers for several months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a guide to record talks with Trump and the potential for removing the president by means of the amendment 25.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last month he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to look up.
In the city, a meeting was held with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "pretend" not to shoot Rosenstein, but then the meeting was set up to avoid crashing with the Senate committee's heights on both Kavanaugh and one of the women he's called for sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, something that delayed the full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, looks up on Fox News Sunday.
When he was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "There has been no date. It can be this week, but I can and see for myself that it will be one week late for everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But I'll see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters may be surprised by this: Sanders has not kept a press orientation for the White House since 10 September.
Verden, Chris Wallace, asked for a drink.
Sanders said that the lack of orientation was not due to a failure of TV reporters to play their game for the gallery, although he said, "I'm not sure they do it."
He made rapid and direct contact between Trump and press coming to increase.
"The President held more press conferences than any president has done earlier," said he - right enough to come without proof of the claim. "I have seen speaking."
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President directly in the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this part, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump takes a broad range of questions when traveling from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the President to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated the blame for what he did to lead the reporters with no shame, and almost disparaging.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fear for EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers working on NHS in Scotland to express thanks and a wish to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, who is a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months ago that Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to taking into account the costs of applications that have been granted as a condition for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected end of autumn.
However, the British Government has reached out to prepare in case there is no agreement.
I remember this must be a difficult time to cover everyone.
That's why I'm going to reimburse the great price I'm going to make for all the supplements, whatever their nationality.
Members of the EU, and beyond, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and societies.
Scotland is completely covered at home, and we will make thick clouds become here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after headset
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after having suffered an injury in the head when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennesean newspaper.
Chief trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened right before the break.
"He came to the side line and contacted, in a way," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed it on a bar and took it back for further evaluation.
An official speaker from Tennessee State told the WSMV that Abercrombie was finally operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and let Tennessee State still try to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to college another year, and is in its first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five hostages before he was injured in the race of Saturday, and is now up to 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher bill when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra income is to be used to help the homeless, according to the new conservation plans
Resolved to neutralize the success of Corbyn by attracting young selections
The document fee will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Stats cash expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year - to help homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher bill when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who are too busy, with a promise to offer spacious buses.
The increase in the document fee will be added to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of counterfeiters.
In addition to the current document fee, the charges include the higher levels introduced for two years on bus number two and rental sites, which may be as much as three per cent.
Statscassa expects decisions to be made up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 per cent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom. This makes prices higher and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the bus market.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ‘spoken villages’ because of the vast number of foreign buyers most of the time being in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson would be spending in document fees to help several young people buy their first home.
He suggested a large construction company to keep the prices up by getting caught in property, but not using it, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas at spacious bus stops to get the UK 's bus fare'.
Corbyn has announced a series of diverging proposals for urban reforms, including controlled rent and the closure of non-caused exhibitions.
He wants and gives greater power to build new bus stops.
May said: "In the past I said that I would dedicate my position to bring back the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the damaged bus market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right to be the same for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, to buy buses that are too hard-working, British builders.
For many people, the dream of their own bus has gone too far, and the sight of being turned upside down is true.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The Head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scotch (42) welcomes the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. In the meantime, they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite in the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I found a B-land battle, and that was it," said Ross to Scotland's BBC Sports Sound.
"But I wake up to see Scotland on Hamden in line with my father, and there's always something we've got to take me back.
It can only come if I have success as a club manager.»
Ross' replacements as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic won won't have our angel to come after so many established names in such a big club, since he's previously denied proximity from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
«For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I can 'get this club back in Premier League.'
In view of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they are at home in Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get yours, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I'm trying to get the club back to you."
Ross is only three years in the career as a manager, after a period of time as an assistant chief in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the training equipment to Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to get out of pressure to third level, and translated St Mirren, who was about to jump down, to the title line in the master series the following season.
And Ross wins that he knows more comfortable now than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was quite a difference," he says about looking for Alloa.
"I thought again that being a manager would be much better than being a player.
It was the right thing to do, because I did it well, tried well and looked like it relatively good.
But play can be cool.
There's a lot of things you've got to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it's known as the right to be manager.
I always want to be a manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can right-hand the entire interview at Sports Sound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
The study shows that the perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The result of the summer has led to an increase in the desire for exciting pubs in the United Kingdom, but also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July the sale increased by 2.7% in the childhood - but for the restaurant industry, it fell by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business consultant Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: “Continual sun, and the fact that England was with VM more than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June car pumps went up 2.8 per cent, just that restaurants became one more hard frame.
The decrease of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars like cell drinks made it much better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubars such as salt food, found and marked the sunset in the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurants.
It might seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
White powders and bars had an increase of 6.6 percent this month, while food had gone down by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analysis of travel and leisure in RSM, said: “These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to salt in the non-profit sector.
It is no surprise that the restaurant's fuel will still disappear. A decline in the sale of 4.8 per cent per year will be found at the top of a running cost.
The long hot summer couldn't arrive at a later time for operators running with food. The time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have in August can give us a short space.'
The total salsaukation of across pubs and restaurants, including innovations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in the production of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker's salsom monitor for the British pub, bar and restaurant fuel collects and analyzes results from 47 operating groups that have a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is the reference index of the established brand.
One of five children have secret profiles of social media that they hide for parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - have secret profiles on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, shows a survey
A study of 20,000 students in the past reveals an increase in “false Insta” profiles
This news has added to the fear that sexual content will be mailed
Twenty percent of the adults have a main profile of the parent
One of five children - some as young as 11 - store profiles on social media as they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20 000 students in the previous score resulted in a strong increase in "false Insta" profiles - a reference to the Istagram image platform.
News has increased fear that sexual content will be mailed.
Twenty percent of the elephants sell a stereo head profile they show to their parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who snuck over the secret page to say 13 years old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “choose me.”
Researchers, made by the Digital Awarens' UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) on different scales, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is overwhelming that so many teenagers are free to create places on the network as parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle becomes "atletan's voice" in the Scottish Peace Department
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as the non-administrative director of the Governing Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated peacekeeper in Scotland, and leader Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from its extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eidh has a lot of respect for the cross-border relations between Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's peaceful society, and we are sure that the right of peace in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the government," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm proud to work as a vote for the executives, and I hope I can be helping and helping the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four OL gold and now is a regular guest at BBC, was unable to go for a drive.
On Twitter he wrote: “Today it is a month since I was hit.
I couldn't go.
The law said that it was only a time that could tell me if I came to be good again, or how much.
It has our challenging work, but I've been very well again, learned to go again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Share comments on the Internet on breast pumps that compare mothers with milk sugar
A breast pump company has broken down the opinion on the Internet with a advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with milk sugar.
In order to mark what is described as “the first styling, punctuating breast pump”, technology company Elvie released a small advertising campaign inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gave mothers who obtained milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-fashioned bowl of chirping, to a song that includes: "Yes, I comfort myself, but you don't see hell" and "If you don't notice it, this isn't raining, it's my poppas."
"Puff it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
The advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has also created controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the seafarers, and many victorys it describes the "cracken" in the Mediere industry.
‘Very bad decide to use cookies to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, only that the calcium will be trusted from the days after birth," writes one.
Elvie bridge pumps in an amme-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment stated: «Probably enough traumatistic for both mother and child
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their young ones?"
Another addition: For a smoke removal advertising.
Others defended the advertising, and a lady admitted that it seemed "performable".
"I think this is a great idea.
I wanted to have one if I was still a mother.
Pushing me to feel me a network like a hook.
This advertising is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a great product," write one.
Another comment: “This is a morossy advertising right against mothers who pump (or at work or at the toilet) and feel like crying.
This is not a advertising that escapes or condemns the media industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all have dancing with the discree pump package in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who smoke see themselves as a chicken.
Elvie-pumppa is quite quiet, there are no directions or pipes, and its disk inside an amme-BH, something that gives women peace to move, keep their young, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Ballardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "Elvie pump is a just revolutionary product, that it deserves a vogue and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who enjoy milk and milk sugar, I would like to set out searchlights on breast pumping and challenges related to this, and at the same time demonstrate the extraordinary peace awareness that the new pump will bring, in a sustainable and understandable way.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the ceremony in London, a mother appeared to two up on the podium for designer Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved to the Texas border
The number of immigrant children has increased even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy of the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have our undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and taking a child can threaten their own ability to be in the country.
The risk of the increase in June, when the federation authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be obliged to send fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
A week ago, Matthew Albence, a witness from the Congress's Immigration and Customs Department, said that the Agency has arrested thousands of people who have sought to be sponsors for single minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrestees had nothing on their scroll paper before.
"Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we must continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
As added to the order, new rules have now been introduced to manage the children. The rules require some of them now to be in court before a month has passed, against the previous 60 days.
Many will participate in video chats and not in personal meetings, so as to get their experience to lead an immigration court.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported soon.
The longer the children are in the range, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to selected breaks or sleep deprivations, the more likely they are to be added to the queue. Reports that have appeared in recent months will be the same.
Tellers say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Because of the size of the facility, it is more likely that a child will be beaten.
They allow it to move children to the computer without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or see the hate of friends, to strengthen the trauma as many already struggle with.
Syria requests American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw eye-openly
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now in war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who serves as the Deputy Minister of State, said that the present forces act illegally on Syrian soil under the threat of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with from it".
"You must return to the congregation with open eyes and without hints," he said to the assembly.
Moulalem stressed that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, how many more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight a sacred battle completely against all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “unlawful proximity of the present”.
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country of war.
When the refugee problem was discussed, Mouale said that it was safe for them to come back, and he left it on "some Western countries" to have "spread racial fear" about the circumstances that led the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to the return," he said.
"They make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to recover in Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
The UN diplomats say that a newly established agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major obstacle, has created an opportunity to press forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement is a major attack on Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province of which three million people live.
Moulalem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clearer deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be justified against Yihadis, including warmen from the nussral front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be intimidated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to gather soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to establish a post-war law for Syria and to defend the election.
Moulalem lays down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and ensures that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the articles of the present Constitution", and warn against disturbances.
Quifor Trump comes to win a term
With that logic, Trump will win the election in 2020 if not, as many liberals are likely to hope, the Presidency will get an early end due to scandals and corruption.
It would certainly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency sometime.”
In the moment of writing, there is no sign that the viewers have gone away.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in the best transmission time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has averaged 2.4 million soldiers in the best time of dispatch, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs «The Rachel Maddow Show» plays on the top of the cable race with as much as 3.5 million soldiers on nights with great news.
"It's a fire that people are locked up, because it's something I don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", which deals with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the convention building.
Nell Scowell, an old comedy author and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club» has another theory.
He remembers a tour in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he came to vote on Trump.
He asked him.
"Before he gets me to sleep," he replied according to Scowell.
It's the maintenance value in the cassette.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, history from Washington can determine the future for Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can be united and healthy for the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that can only be consulted by the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in six hours to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort said the bomber jacket of a striper to $15,000 ("a beach soft of arrogance", said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's careful description of Trump's, eh, anatomism.
Personally, I never come to see Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make it known as a real program is that he gave you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, a daily leader of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the show that goes with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You do not have the permission to skip a single episode, otherwise you will not be able to continue.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He didn't want to get out, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood over the Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court hang in a thin thread.
"I remember when I made all these sprays show before the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from external sources in the second half of the range
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to the transformation of the district of the Congress that led to two sitting members fighting on the same site.
The newly converted urban district of Pittsburg presents democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election on the wall in the past.
Lamb fights against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12 district in Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17 district.
The map was reprinted after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January determined that the old districts were illegal to win the Republicans.
Competition in the 17th district has launched an arms conference on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties' money channel, the Democratic Congress election and the Republican Congress election.
Lamb was a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a close special election in its 18th Congress district in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been right for a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump watered the district with more than 20 points.
Political experts have given democracy a good advantage.
USA assessed to punish El Salvador based support for China, but withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for partners to throw out the Trump organisation's lead group.
The State Secretarys decided to bring back the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's speechwoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included economic support and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high labour and mortality rates.
As the internal meeting developed, North American and Central American embassies held a conference on security and economic well-being in order to follow up a similar collection in which a step forward was taken to prevent immigrants from arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September the top administrators informed them that they wanted the conference to be held and put an end to the assessment of the El Salvador penalty.
It has now been said that Vice-President Mike Pence will meet with the conference, which has been planned in mid-October, as a signal to the relevance of the administration of the conference, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new empty messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American servicemen, including two diplomats, who were able to discuss the internal views on the importance of anonymousity.
Their description was confirmed by an inexplicable analyst working closely with the administration and also speaking under the assumption of anonymity.
History
A special adviser, Robert Mueller, is waiting for his report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller must have turned his attention to research into whether Trump's campaign was designed with Russia to introduce attacks on our elections.
If the Congress were to replace leaders, Trump would have to stand right in this body, preparing himself to overcome the well-beings and possibly a jury of his fellowmen.
It's a lot of "quick about" and I don't mean that Trump's case is inevitable – also for his opposition in Europe.
It's a choice to take for all of us on both sides of the lady, which will affect how long the struggle can be.
In 1938 the German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and lost a chance to avoid years of bloodshed this led to.
The course of history revolves around such a turning point, and democracy is accelerated or abandoned by its subterranean march.
The Americans are facing several of these points now.
What will we do if Trump shoots Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's research?
Rosenstein has been in deep water all the time since this ad declared that he proposed to shut down the president in secret, and reflected in whether he was incapable of his role.
Rosenstein wins The Times' description is invalid.
«Korleis will respond to us if the recent FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite serious charges of sexual abuse, and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle election for a convention called Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think I'm wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country I have my ambassador in.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later he sent me out of the guard to wear sabbat-light on the table asking for the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers' taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday, welcome to say about the Austrians, after an imputing in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good start to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A networked obstacle to the middle-band player Graham Dorrans to do his first act this season before the 2-2 results against Villarreal, but he argues that Rangers can use this result as a jump board for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good law," said the 31st year.
"We went into the fight, hoping we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but everything in the world is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we got out in the second half and it was better.
On Thursday, there will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a pretty hard fight, and they've got a good result in their previous fight, but with the public behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been ours, with everything that has happened with my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The chair is good and the guys are tired; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be happy."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in a study had clear thoughts about how they would be taken into consideration, few were talking to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in an investigation from the Nationalwide insurance company spoke to their real estate owners about the long-term costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their boys about it.
"People will have a family member to take care of, but they do not take the necessary steps to have the conversation," says the vice-president of the Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your young ones: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not want your best time on the road.
Working with a consultant and your family to discuss how and how you should receive care, since these values can be a major part of determining the costs.
Get an economic advisor: Your consultant can also help you find out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-insurance insurance to help pay the expenses, or that you guarantee yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create a legal document: Prevent legal conflicts before starting.
Get a health-fully qualified position, so that you appoint a person you trust to take care of your medical treatment and to ensure that professional deals are in line with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
You can also evaluate a full power for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to make economic decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the option.
Don't forget the little details: Make sure your old parents have a medical emergency and are waiting for the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just financials it's about, but who's the lawyer?" said Martin.
"What kind of medicine is it?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
The plans are clear."
The man shot several times with air assets in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times by an airman while he was on his way home after a trip to town.
The 40-year-old victim was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Politicians describe the shooting, which took place around 02.30 local time, as a ‘spatial action’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police ask for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people are killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the public servicemen. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, volunteers have not received any information from Donghea, a region north of Palu that is closer to the surface of the map, which had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghea, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay overlooking the western coast of Sulawesiõa. The estimated population rate in 2017 was 379 800.
The town celebrated its 40-year anniversary when the roof and the tsunami hit.
Dondâna is a region that extends over 300 km from the coastal north-west of the island.
The region, which is a administrative region smaller than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the characteristics of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, particularly in the coastal region of Donghea.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated on Morovali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhea have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the disaster education agency in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes were damaged by a tsunami in Donghea.
In 1996 the west side of Donghea was hit by a tsunami that took the lives of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic Ildrigen in the Pacific and becomes a vast framework of land mines.
Here's some of the big holes and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A great victory on the west coast of the Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of large villages struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A battle with strength 6.8 hits south of Java, the most popular island in Indonesia, and solved a tsunami that hit the southern coast and took the lives of almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A fortress with a strength 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra and dissolved a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed thousands of villages and took the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A small village hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused damage and panic when people were reminded of the village and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunamis were solved this time, but more than 100 lives were lost because of fast - paced buildings.
2018: Great village met tourists Lombok and took the life of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The painting destroys thousands of buildings and remains thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
The last son of Sarah Palin arrested and targeted for election at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested, aimed at extinction.
According to a report released by the Dutch state policy, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of choice at home, association in reporting elections at home and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman who was known as a woman when he tried to call the police to report the breach.
Palin becomes a drug-related prisoner in the Mat-Su prison, and is held against the charge of 500 dollars, reported by KTUU.
He appeared on the court's day and declared "not guilty" when he was asked to enter the network.
Palin is facing three errors in Class A, something that means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a category B misdemeanor, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been convicted of something criminal.
In December 2017, he was sentenced to his father's death, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up at the Alaska Water Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attacks at the home, mixing in a report of the choice in the home and holding a weapon while he was aware of the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed he shot him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterinary groups after linking the son's selective behaviour to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The painting, with a strength of 7.5, solved a tsunami and destroyed several thousand homes.
The electricity and communication networks are down, and the number of arrivals is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit right outside the central part of Sulawesi, situated north of the capital Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic eye-to-peak appearance of encounters flourish on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the area.
Federal actors will rarely have death penalty for suspects in New York terrors
Federal actors in New York will have death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that took the lives of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) must have used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, when he was running foot-and-mouthing and cycling on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "with his will" and that he "with his will" inflicted serious, bodily damage, according to a note archived in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be caused by a possible death penalty, as set out in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a feeder jure delivered a list of 22 points of reference, including eight deaths for money-pressure targets, usually used by federation actors in connection with organised crime, and a target for the selection and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for a "essential planning and transfer", the actors said and described how Saipov carried out the attack as a ‘extraordinary, cruel and demanding’.
‘Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco,’ says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the southern district of New York has condemned the death penalty in a case.
The target, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the life of two doublers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to commit a spying for the Soviet Union during the so-called war two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of indications in the days and months following, according to legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after having seen videos from ISIS on the phone, it's in the contract.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag on the hospital room, the police said.

Saipov's supporters had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.

President Donald Trump made a statement by Senator Diane Feinstein on an election Saturday on the grounds that he did not make the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, where he calls the Supreme Court of the so-called Board of Cavanaugh for sexual abuse.
During a election meeting in West Virginia, President Ford did not direct the Senate Commission, but also commented that what was going on in the afternoon showed that the people were “slow and quiet and quiet and speak unsanitary”.
"The only thing that can happen, and the clear thing that's happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the mind, when you see people who are sensitive and insensitive and unsatisfied and talk nonsense," he said.
«When you look at publications and toys and then say «Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Think about it?
Diane Feinstein, did you make it?
Thinking about her answer... you made the document-- "Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't laugh at it.»
Wait a minute.
Let us-- no, we didn't do it," he added, while he followed the senator.

Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."

“They are determined to withdraw power in all ways they see it necessary.
You see shame, pride, they don't care about women they hurt, they have to run over to get power and control," said the president of Mediaite.

Analyticals store the timeline over the night when women burned alive
The party's powers provide all evidence on Saturday under the alleged court case for a man who was charged to burn a woman from Mississippi living in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He made for the jury how he put together his cell phone records to find out what she was doing at night when Jessica Chambers (19) was murdered by the alleged Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told him that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers' night he died, contrary to what Tellis had previously explained.
When the location data showed Tellis his cell phone was with Chambers' mobile at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police took him to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was outside that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he said "falsely because my car was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis said he had known Chambers in about two weeks when he died.
But the expensive mobile phone calculations showed that they only knew each other in a week.
Rowlett said that one hour after Chambers died, he deleted Tellis' messages, conversations and Chambers' contact information from his cell phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence shall conclude the case on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected justice to go to court later that day.

As the case goes, the public has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their progress and logic.
Leaving behind the Paddington books was ready so that people didn't come to look like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The author, Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: “It is difficult to see how it was to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very funny to know how successful Paddington was now."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a book about the Vessian teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
In the case of Paddington, which he described as “a very important member of the family,” let him know that her father was proud of the extent of his success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he never ran," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you'll be proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind.
I'm afraid he saw Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all the rose to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to take color on the phone.
When his country was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice at all times, the wages of labor were abandoned by saving her life.
"Nad called regularly to see that it was quite wrong that they didn't bother him to get it done," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to see that he came to die within the next two minutes and that I had to be colourful to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy in you, dear.
I'll be right back to be with you.
I'll be right back.
The medications had given her so that her heart would continue pumping was subject to pressure from her system.
He had already died and now the body was about to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't stand or scream because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything in.»
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now cares for the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what had just passed through.
"No one knew anything," said he.
‘I sat with my head in the middle of the chest.’
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was."
Surgeoning women wear masks on their neck to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their own girlfriends who took suicide attempt to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have fixed the lamps on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people who are thinking of taking suicide to defend themselves and calling numbers on the lamps.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he started fighting depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to know me as I know me every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that was infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile lighted up all the rooms."
But before he died, he ended up at work, for he was in a "real dark city".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother to Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that the vesicle could have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the laps "for people to know that there are other people out there who care and who can talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit there adult – you have to talk to anyone.»
Humphreys, who has been our friends for many years to Davis, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was angry or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before July we noticed that he began to behave otherwise.
He was in the basement emotionally on July 1, when the children opened their gifts, he did not see them at the entrances."
He said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "It's a big void in our family now.
We're totally ruined.
But we must all struggle to live further.»

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI is starting research.
"I thought that if we actually found something like what he asked about – a limited research – we might get a little lonely," Fleke said on Saturday, and let him be ready to fall together in the midst of a party-bacles.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters investigate the FBI?
They're nuts because of the darkness.
The average in the United States is only five weeks away on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do it well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. capital.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then the secretary was Bush.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
They come to smoke in the afternoon, 51 republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 Russians per week. With 50 Russians, Mike Pense, the vice-president of the United States, can give him the last shot and confirm him at the top.
The number of kidnappers in North Korea "go down" under Kim
The number of North Korean fans to South Korea has gone down since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawyer
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Unity, and said there were 1127 respondents in four – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that the stricter limits between North Korea and China and animal waste are the main reasons for the decline in the number.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The majority of the refugees from North Korea receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees across China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at kidnappers as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often send them back with forced labor.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are purely technically still in war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang meet to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks came after the historic meeting in June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they were agreed to work for an atomic Korean semiconductor.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho U.S. owes nothing else.
"In addition to trusting in the United States, we cannot trust our country's security, and in such a situation we cannot defeat our weapons first," said Ri in a United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he can't serve in the top.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the summit, "histerical" and said he has too much temperature to serve in the American summit.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "histerical" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had engaged in that way, he had been called "histerical," said Pelosi about the witness burden to Kavanaugh before the Senate-Marstorto on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and rejected all statements that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening hall of Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and cried for times with a cramp in his neck while he told about his family and the years ahead.
He criticised the Democrats in the Committee and called for his "big and planned attention to his kingdom," organised by liberal politicians who felt that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi let him threaten Kavanaugh's testimony evidence that he can't serve in the capital because it shows that he's guilty of democracies.
"I believe that the way he reacted to his disqualification, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi came with an objection when he was asked if he would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the summit, and if the Democrats win the majority of the Representative House.
"I can see this – if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he can't serve in the capital, nor in the court he's serving now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal appeal court.
Pelosi also said that as a democracy, he is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the auctions to confirm Kavanaugh, avoid him from answering questions about whether he came to turn certain decisions into the summit.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, crazy person in the upper room who expects us to see that he's cool," said Pelosi.
And women must turn the sword
It's a fair, bit critical, after months and years with racer, and he doesn't get it out without crying.
"We met when we were in the middle," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
He continued, "I found a lot of help from a woman in a high position, as he said that he noticed when he was feeling, but developed a technique like that to the person who made her feel that he cared, "You might think I'm sorry because I got caught.
I'm here."
And then he just continued.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears work as a way to get the mind on, but there's a lot of misunderstanding.
In one of my strong memories of me from an earlier job, how many of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was aware of my thoughts, and a woman who was older than I was taking me into my neck – he was a cold lady who I had always been alive for – and took me out on time.
"Never let them see you cry," he said to me.
“You don’t know how fast you are.
They think you're in love with them and that they're in the water because they found you crying."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a democracy from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987 Hart was taken out of a boat called Monkey Business, and pulled away from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that he could make the same choice as the president himself.
"I didn't really think of it well enough," said he to me while he was asleep, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who made the choice, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation "Snuck white and the seven dwarves."»
Since the campaign had already been for a while, he had not collected enough money, so he hoped he would just stop if he was able to collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
He discovered that her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they believe that I'm going to get fired?" he asked.
When he declared that he did not come to make choices, he was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the smokers instead of the delegates, and the idea of gender discrimination, that he began to cry during the talk.
"You'd fear I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press responded when he laughed.
"You should be afraid that Kleineex was my chief sponsor.
I think I was thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"Ho green"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening balances in the US-China trade war were in vain, and while the battle continued, a call between the two countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
American President Donald Trump shot the first shot in the year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States will be taxed.
Beijing has taken home and established a rate of between five and ten per cent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has the right to answer the United States for every shot they're going through, and the next largest economy in the world is probably not going to go down with the first one.
In order to get Washington to end, China has to do so with the United States, but to turn to the United States is too much for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing has been called the head, the US press can have a positive impact on the Chinese economy for a long time by reducing the level of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a political party in Washington or Beijing can get both economies to go under are more dangerous than people have to admit earlier," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thought-making mission.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been damaged after more than seven years of war.
