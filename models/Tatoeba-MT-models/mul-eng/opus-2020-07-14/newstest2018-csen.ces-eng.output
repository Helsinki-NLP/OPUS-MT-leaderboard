Citizens' rights have issued a road alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Exploitation of Colorful People (NAACP) published a warning for Colorful People travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of state and racist attacks.
"The NAACP's recommendations for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls for African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri citizens to pay increased attention to the country's travel towards the country due to the series of racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place in the entire state," said the Association.
NAACP noted that it had acceded to this step on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which facilitate the defence of racist acts motivated before the court, as well as the conduct of the authorities in criminal proceedings, which are not targeted at minorities.
"It is due to violations of civil rights.
People are stopped by the police only because of their color, are attacked or killed," announced Kansas City Star president NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We are now meeting with the greatest number of difficulties."
It's about the first warning of its kind that the U.S. organization has issued.
Among the incidents that the organization quoted were racially motivated charges directed against the students of black hair at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black hair from Tennessee.
Sanders died in an emergency at the beginning of the year after he was on his way to the state, and the police took him to prison without accusing him of saving the crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to the recent declaration of the state's highest state representative of Missouri, which indicates that the drivers of black bullets have a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The aim of the travel recommendation is to warn people and to protect their families, friends and colleagues from what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should take money with them on a case-by-case penalty or warn their neighbors that they are willing to travel by state."
According to the current number of FBI programmes for reporting hate crimes, in 2015 Missouri, hundreds of cases of hate crimes were reported, reaching a state-of-the-art point among all States.
Travel insurance is also a response to the new Missouri law, which facilitates the claim of discrimination by providing housing or employment.
The American Association for Civil Liberties (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona following the adoption of an immigration law enabling state actors to retain people on the basis of a violation of this law which, according to ACLU, is to improve racial profile.
The travel recommendation usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to foreign countries, but in recent years the legal groups have joined these measures in response to specific laws and trends in the United States.
The model was killed by the chief.
Her family doesn't have any comfort after 12 years!
The murdered is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
The girl from Croydon was killed by chief Mark Dix in 2005 right at the restaurant where she worked, and she was injured.
The victim and the murderer were supposed to have sex and smoking marijuana, and then he killed her.
Vrah then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched a thorough criminal work looking for a place to do.
Dixie, former chief, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years' imprisonment for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The court admitted only a young man's attack, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a dead girl lying on the street.
Three years later, the police testified to him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sportson had been hit by court nights.
The voice said, "He was very angry, and after his attack a girl started to scream."
"Doconce attracted attention and taxis," he said lyingly.
The girl had to defend herself for his statement, but she could, even shit.
Lewis was supposed to shoot her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved to be a lie and accused him of it.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his persistence and the feeling of the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt comfortable and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was in his former friend's company, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, he said to the police, Dexie himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he hit her back and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years the family is headed for another attack by the vandals.
In the last half of the year, they hurt him four times.
There are so cruel people on the loose that they cover these graveyards.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Miror's mother told the little girl Linda's information about the destruction of the urine with the ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to fight when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"They're not good or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague Butt of Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aid.
Including those from Czech designer Annie Marše.
It started suddenly, a robbery 12 years ago.
Martin Raž and his friend came out on a bicycle after Moravia.
One of them didn't just come along with the bike, but also the bugs are filled with the vibrators that look just like it.
"The various buds and dolphins and all of them were green and yellow and just completely different," she told me about the dinner.
His friend also decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of design erotic help Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, and he offered to quit marketing.
When the colleague left to hire another professor, he was rewarded.
Today it runs in the Prague Benediktsk street of the Intimity store, where it sells erotic aid in a way that is usually offered by luxury cables or bottles.
Why not?
It's also about design items.
moment, moment, this is what you're talking about in lunch, are you saying?
But come on, don't be such a Puritans!
Just Berlin's Fun Factory trade, which proposed the famous designer Karim Rashid, served for the Butt of Intimity as inspiration.
It was opened in 2010 and was completely different from the concept of the erotic trade that everyone here used to have.
No hidden exhibitions, all made in beautiful, decent style, products made more than in perfume.
Martin began to consider with his business partner Zdenek Šebelk, how to obtain the Prague trade where he should be and what his name should be.
The name of Intimity was popular with both of them.
"It's related to intimacy at last and it's also, it can be said, it's wrong," she says.
She's been tracking the purchase of Internet sites and looking for an appropriate space that went parallel to various visuals of the interior.
Finally, she blessed the variant, which distributed the trade into the garden of the kitchen and the bedroom that led the bed.
She prepared it for us by Dagmar Štépán from the Formafatal study.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfectly ideal because he's not on the main street, but because he was sitting on the name of intimacy.
It's intimate.
She's in the street next to the main street, so no customers are looking at her," says Martin Raj.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a trade that would be different, with a brand-new beautiful product, in the middle where women who are mainly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of getting into such a trade.
When I got into the Intimity button half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I shouldn't even feel like I'm going to trade with erotic help.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from the boots with fashion.
Even if there's only female duty in the store, so that the women don't stop asking for help, it doesn't mean that the man's leg wouldn't come back.
Most of them are going to buy gifts for their friends.
"A man can't determine the right size and he likes more," Martin laughs over a frequent mistake.
These are the premises, the living clichés that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith needs to choose a really big vibrator.
Likewise, a man loves a very black garment, and a woman makes it to a red color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called satisfier.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know what's going on, because Martin immediately explains how he works.
It's such a free-of-charge clitoris stimulator.
Pere needs a teenager in me to be surprised at what I've been given with a serious tone of understanding.
It doesn't seem like it's going to work.
And that doesn't really make sense.
It's a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't believe he'd be so well accepted.
It's about some of the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution triggered a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He was concerned that women were becoming more interested in the design of such products.
The second time he was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He collected a total of tobacco that could survive in some men and that he sees competition in erotic aid.
"There are different options," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with a remote control.
It's a favorite category.
A woman may have in the hands of the ruler and determine the intensity of the vibrating.
On the contrary, a certain vendor is a category of contracting vibrators.
At least we're in.
Czech women seem to be predisposing multi-skilled and buy classic vibrators, although they should only use it externally.
Right in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to say that a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I think it's gonna have to be a little different.
The question is what men offer," says Martin.
"We also have aid for them, but to a limited extent." Most of them are sold primarily by a masturbater, in this case by the manufacturer of Tenga.
It doesn't look like anatomically similar vagina, but "scream as a spray gel or as an egg or a futuristic object.
Much depends on the functionality and benefits of the use.
It's completely different in Japan.
It's a miracle in me.
I mean, I was thinking that Japan's getting a lot of emotional support, I guess.
"That's the reality of the Internet," I'm told.
This guy's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aid is more closely linked to the use of women.
In Japan, they are simply normal for men, and instead are taboo for women."Only for the sake of interest - what the Japanese sign of Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity box, is sold worldwide, is still making half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Chechnya and Chechnya aren't very good at all.
On the contrary, we are all the opposite nations.
Probably different from the country, such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical customer of trade moves between 35 and 50 years and "he has a certain experience yet with sexual life, but with some help.
It comes for something nicer, better, which would fill a partner's life, or for himself."To return, Martin Ráž with his business partner Zdenek Šebelko is looking forward to making sure that each product is fully functional.
We also don't want to go to the specialty of the type of bunker and latex, because we don't have space for it, but it doesn't happen here.
Such things may affect those we are trying to reach.
What are the people who always had to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like this would happen to them.
The composition of the products displayed on the police is really popular.
This is also indicated by the selection of represented renamed characters.
Some even obtained design prices, including Red Dot Design Award.
In fact, the first assessment was mentioned by the sea horse "and this led to a change in the entire sector.
It started to get rid of cheap materials and instead of working with healthy people, it started to produce other designs, different colors...
It is acceptable that some of the designs of the Czechs are based on the design of the famous designer Anna Maršov.
I have to say that I've been pretty surprised how many people are with us the design things Whoop.de.do from Annie Marše's purchase, although they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who go directly to Venice's church from Annie Marše.
It has indeed led to the fact that, within the Czech Republic and abroad, it is precisely what we are trying to present to us - that erotic aid is allowed to do otherwise, very nice, with the story.
Anna's story started as a school job.
Now it's about a finished product that's more made of us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how to make Whoop.de.do products.
Because it's not about major production, but a little series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going a little against the flow, but I think it's important to keep development within us in the Czech Republic.
It might be easy to believe that in a few years we will not be able to do anything," she later describes the situation of Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is more open.
The negative or negative situation is not met.
At least they're free people.
"But then you start laughing." Currently Anna Maršev has a vibrator that you can let to make a personal report, and this year also plans your own lubricant gel.
The next year, she should get a vibrating egg and other news.
Limits on the health of sex
I'm interested in where the boundaries of what's right are laid.
Is there anything that Martin Raz wouldn't sell anymore?
It's very hard to define.
What comes to one is normal, the other may seem just abnormal, so we are more limited by the variety of brands.
None of them will be allowed to go to some extremes.
Before we decide, I have the last question: What was the most obvious question they had received?
Right now, in the week, he came by e-mail, in which some woman asked for a masturbating aid for her friend with a distance of twenty-eight centimetres.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
It's still a question if anyone of us has done a joke," Martin's suspicious look at me.
And it's been a while...
Morning for Karla Gotta.
Two racoons of Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štédry is fighting a serious weakness.
The best friend of Karl Gotta is struggling with a weakness that robs people of all memories.
"Ano, it's divine truth," confirmed the sad information of Blasko himself.
I know about my disability, and I'm still looking at the circumstances.
"The drugs that have the original liver's inability to reduce," he added, thanking the neighbor for his support.
The entire developmental family was forced to simplify Karl's life.
Eve's wife is trying to be home, the most important thing is that she comes to her father's house in the White Mountains and daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, the son of Karel, named Karlas.
He fought cancer twice and gave Slavík his experience to support him during his compulsory treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy for him.
He was able to get back to work and to tennis court and to skiing.
"I'm supposed to be here by the astrologer to be in my 90s," said Karel Blesko.
He's a warrior.
He's still trying to sing.
"I still pay attention to the words of the song so that I don't forget them," Karel acknowledged.
The same weakness is now being fought in the constitution and the hero Flower Fiol.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's?
Look at how to treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has cancelled the ban on interruption, the U.S. law.
In Chile, an absolute ban on artificial reduction of pregnancy should therefore not be imposed on health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have brought difficulties to the Constitutional Court and that there will now be ten people to decide on what we have agreed in Parliament for more than two years," said socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should, at the end of August, receive a new president, which is under the AFP's immediate opposition.
The law prohibiting the absolute prohibition of interruption, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, adopted the Senate on 19 July.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it says it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
The motion for a bill was suspended last month until it was examined by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
In the middle of the proposal, the MEPs agreed and the Senate did so again after them.
According to the new legislative reform, it should cease to be an artificial reduction of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fruit does not have hope of survival, or if pregnancy has resulted from rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish letter El País in Chile since 1931, and even before the women obtained a voluntary right there in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruption in 1989 was imposed by legal dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before leaving the office of President.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where it pays for an absolute prohibition of interruption.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women in the network, who are retiring to 30 years of imprisonment.
In many cases, it was followed by human rights defenders on the spontaneous execution that the court has designated for murder.
Is there anything more sacred?
The goal of the White House of Trump is now Socha Freedom
A poor sign of change in the regime is a drought criticism.
The Americans could report this as well as all the others - see the carefully illustrated appearance of Saddáma Hussiana in the baths of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was going to agree when, during a lively debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosto on the presidential proposals for a drastic restriction on legal passengers, he expressed a symbolic security at Soch Freedom.
It turns out Miller didn't stand on the couch like that.
To do that, he would be violating the gift of the owners of the flight ships and the immitators of the Sochy Freedom.
However, he challenged its significance, in particular the fact that in 1903 the plaque was placed on the foundation with the famous basilica Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller quoted Acosta as saying: “I don’t want to be here in history, but the Socha Freedom is... symbol of American freedom, which brings light all over the world.
The pool that was added to the foundation and which you refer to is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not about history here.
This is especially about the disturbing words of Amy Lazarus, who resolve today - including not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let me go, who is blind, who is poor, who is willing to breathe a laugh, who is poor in the midst of the city."
And just in modern times, we can do better than ever to watch these "beasts" on our screens.
Miller didn't try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people aren't welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the meaning of drought is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, just like her friends who, after her death, stood up for a plate with a ring on the base of the shirt, knew quite well she was going to go to high-political games.
The Socha should express the link between the French and American republican governments by representing a classic theme and the free movement of women.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her womb there is no female an abstract status, but she has her own voice.
He also has a very different name: Mother of the victors.
Facing with a woman's representative is a brilliant feminist charm and a devastating attack on American nativity.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the bones, the right-of-the-law seeks to restore this meaning for a long time.
The famous commentist Rush Limbaugh - Jana Kristler on the issue of Trump's approach to power - in 2010 argued that the Socha Freedom does not actually call anyone to the country, but represents an early non-constructiveism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: "Socha Freedom continues ahead.
It's the source of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The walk is not to light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's buying up on an important thing.
Socha's name depends on the scope of the inspection.
Emma Lazarus describes the juice from the sight of a crushed and ruined traveler, who, many after a long and terrible flood, comes with hope in the new country.
It's a story about the world of people who are looking for shelter and a better way of life.
From this point of view, the salt expresses hope and satisfies their needs.
And of course it's a perspective that Miller or Trump don't really know.
Their origin is not to shed light on the way, but to destroy hatred, which is their only source of power.
The World's Mystery of the Athletics 2017: Neil Black sings praises to the Scottish members of the British team
Elid Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members
The U.S. president of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, indicated that a strong 16 Scots in the World's Mystery team would be “a cross-border contribution to the team”.
For MS in London, starting on Friday, 2017, a record number of Scottish athletes were selected.
Black believes that in Scotland, "it's going to be something special" and British athletes could learn from Scott.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it," Black said.
"I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The representatives of Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletes: He's got something to do with what they did.
They think it's people on the streets, too.
Whatever it is, it's just amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will attack medals, including Laurie Muirove and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farahem in the race for 5000 metres, while Elid Doyle was elected as the captain of the team.
‘It shall be broken.
Her initial words were amazing," Black said.
“A few athletes, whether Scots or other nations, left the rooms with a sense of awe and motivation.
Your and unexplained feelings that Elid spoke to were irreparable."
Comonwealth's strong medalist, who will compete during the 400m pass on his fifth world mission, pointed out that it is “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 to 2015 is seven.
Usually, Muir's average track was only in the last five years of British and two European records.
The MS will participate at a distance of 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who runs for 1500 meters. In the annual season he won British team competitions and annual games.
Doyle recalls his first mission, which was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The captain of the team found that it was "very impressive" in the fact that not only the large number of its colleagues had arrived, but in many cases they would also be attacked for participation in the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary position of the captain of the team is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team is a happy one," he added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where I moved.
They're the athletes who'll think of the front seats on the floor.
What about my initial word?
Yeah, I think she did.
I've just warned that we can be on the annual mission because it's on the home floor.
It is important to use the support of home fans and to rejoice that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance for the race and I'm going to enjoy an ineffective atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about public function if you don't get a voter criticism
Our father knew about his criticism.
American George Washington loved it, but the news didn't take long to start criticising it for anything, starting with foreign politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, these criticisms left her cold.
But he didn't try to hide the criticisms.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “The freedom of expression can be removed - and stupid and we will be known as sheep on a stake."
That brings me to Maryland is the government of Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan employees blocked and made contributions to at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week for her actions, she complained to the U.S. Union for civil freedom.
The government's employees rejected the application as unfounded and in comments on the Internet, many views were expressed by the type of "who cares about it".
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
That's what it's all about.
Especially at the moment when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, there is an unwarranted popular republican governor.
It can cool off the second highest favorites of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not crazy.
As it is obvious, his state rules with certainty itself and adheres closely to principles.
It has been shown that it is also useful to use Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - except for the fact that there is no publication of the first photo with the holo head after the completion of chemotherapy.
The blocking of the people who congratulate the government - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by its employees with money paid by taxpayers - is extremely dangerous and ultimately dangerous.
In the discussion on Washington Post Hogan's speech, Amelia Chase's governor was defending that blocking comments had come from a position of moderation of contributions.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or different people is too easy.
Washington Post told several real people who had been ruined by contributions.
And that's exactly what they are - real people talking to their chosen leaders; a teacher, a business and a pastor, no trolleys.
As everyone pointed out, their comments were two-and-a-half, not red.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, applying to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's company, Md., asked for hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I was surprised to note that I was disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other news," wrote in the section with the Washington Post daily comment.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are marked for promoting so-called collective efforts instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested people."
What the government employees call "the centre of the spam level" would probably call it "the opposite."
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily make contributions by blocking criticism or reducing negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the street where they would collect and sleep all pressures with criticism or arrests or silence the protesters.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public factor to be criticized for the Hanobeuk and other social media.
President Trump raises a complaint from the Twitter user, who has opened access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The President of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first addition to James C. Cacherise, in Alexandria, where she withdrew access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also expected visits from ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, she had a low price of post-posting virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of day - to - day printings was four times greater, and the leader’s position was inconceivable to many anonymous writers.
And even in those days Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under the pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the press and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people under the online project Papers of George Washington Project, in his office, he collected petitions criticising his position against the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he didn't.
Freedom of expression, ignorance and fear lies in the very foundations of our people.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, and abroad they need more data than home.
In foreign Czechs, they need more from their tariff than from home.
They are most often moving to Raków, but the data consumption in the annual season is taking place in Croatia.
However, they have more time to browse the website, most of them have no access to Wi-Fi under the sun.
Beach, shopping and smart phone in your hand.
This seems to be the typical Czech permit in Croatia after which customers can use the services of foreign operators for domestic prices.
This is derived from the clean company statistics O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech passengers abroad have more data available in the area than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the winter runs at least the minimum of the nests, data consumption was even below the age of one year.
In the second place, Italy was placed in the chest of the data used.
The Czechs spend most of their minutes in Germany, where many of them work and during the years.
Croatia, according to the data of the Association of Czech travel offices, is visiting 800 thousand Czechs annually, so is our most popular destination.
But people here changed the book to share experiences using the mobile phone.
The record was June 7th.
"With the data transmitted, ten million photos would be taken," explained the details of the mobile segment manager at O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Although Croatia is leading the range of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
The first place is Rakousko, followed by Germany and Slovenia.
Croatia's up to fourth and Italy's sixth.
To Rakouska we're looking for a better tourist and active permit, which we don't have so much time for browsing on the Internet.
"In addition to Rakousko, Cheši goes straight to Jadran," Cieslarov explained.
While the operator reported on the release of roaming charges for high inter-annual growth, there is much less growth on the phone.
The number of minutes spent in the roming grew to the length of a two-year period.
With a huge jump in front of other countries, Germany is ruling here.
"Roming uses more company customers on the job," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty in the home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former golf team, Ronan Rafferty, will be engaged for the next three days in a comfortable atmosphere at Rennaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, hosted by 25th-year-old Scotty Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the small golf course of Archerfield Links on the way to the finish line under Paul Eales. This year will play the role of the ambassador of the tournament in the representation of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've been watching Renaissance Club gradually grow up in front of my eyes and the summer tournament will show the world of its beauty," said Rafferty.
"The players will be able to love the first-class quality garden.
Jerry took a great job.
He's a hot fan of this game and he's proud of his success.
The annual tour is in the right hands."
The English Eales will be the first to defend the mystery title, although during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I did not have the opportunity to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because the year after my victory was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is boring.
It's a beautiful place on golf.
I remember last year when my wife, Sharon, meant a really great reward for me and my wife.
It was a beautiful time for me not to forget."
On the home floor is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after he celebrated 50 years of the year.
This event will be his first part since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always enjoy playing at home," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to happen to you and then you feel a great pressure.
I really liked to play again, and I think it's my turn.
I'm satisfied with the results."
Three players are also joined by former winner Masters Ian Woosnam and senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former competitor Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players in the game; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The car is free of charge. Parking is 5 £ for a single passenger car and 10 £ for a car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be paid to Prostate Cancer UK.
Loss and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei's dinner is over, he doesn't use a drink.
In fact, it's only when it's used.
In her wooden chart, which is located in the capital of Paniai Enorotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually walks in a sweet brown - in the words of the local "notate" - straight into the fire.
After half an hour, we'll get out and feel comfortable with it with our uncomplicated hands.
Bardina sits on a bloc land - the house is not equipped with a furniture - where she is also doing her daily work, such as washing the dishes in the cold water from a nearby press.
The kitchen in the room with no fireplace fills the toilet.
As the youngest of four of her husband's men, she was not assigned to any work fields.
Poligemia is common here.
In the late night hours, most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In the village, soldiers sit in.
"In the afternoon after five hours no one will be allowed to go around the neighborhood," says Bardina.
This is an unusual view of daily life at the height of Papui, a former Dutch colony, declared to be part of Indonesia in 1969 after the controversial referendum, when only 1026 seniors were brought to vote in the form of a public hand-extinguishment before the occupying army.
The current wave of protest against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the quadrilateral government, which ruled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into the Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enirotal is so far away and abandoned a city that you will get from the main town of Jayapura to Nabire after a five-year journey.
The mass transport in this place doesn't work.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bambosus plates, which are made up of welded leaves in the deserts of silk and paint.
There were only a few Indonesians, then journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local people worshipped the divine name, Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these hats," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-cluttered turban, dark shirts and shawls.
"We used to carry only the letters."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and higher child mortality is one of the worst in Asia.
However, this is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and largest gold mine in the world of Grasberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai - a scaled province about the size of New Jersey, which is about 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 was Freeport spent gold and silver at $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports the weight of wood in the estimated amount of $78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of torture and the guarantee of the invasion by powerful Indonesian armies.
A survey carried out by the New York Times in 2005 revealed that Freeport paid to local military actors and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one holder.
The papuans flying for self-esteem threaten this golden dog and are therefore severely wounded.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuanians have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the province of Papu during the 70th century were similar to genocide, as the Asian Human Rights Commission stated.
In the last year alone, the Indonesian police in the region arrested more than 3300 peaceful Protestants.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 brisbanic archidioces report, describes the cruelty to which the last year, as extreme corrections, torture - according to other reports, is particularly popular rape and the correction of electric traffic - and brutal harassment of peaceful demonstrators.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims, because the incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harrison, a human rights Watch, a Indonesian researcher.
The whole situation has caused the fact that the Papoan sources belong to the colony of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the larger province, 83% are professing Christianity, but democracy changes with the exception of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Javi, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Public canteens sell frozen chicken and gado-years or a mixture of vegetables with an arse sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling corn and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuanci," explains four-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the main city of Jayapur.
"The original people of Papuy - Mama (women) - have lost their job."
Indonesian President Joko Vido, who is represented by Joko, in 2014 under his presidential campaign, promised to address the injustice and violation of rights.
The former Tesserate secured his way to the Presidential Palace in some 27 of the 29 districts of Papui, including Paniai.
But in Papua it has changed very little, and local people feel lonely.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with hope that he would hear our call for justice," you said.
The fact is, just two months after the regular inaugural inaugural of Jakow, the Paniai experienced a great shock.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children sang a night song in the camp fire in the city of Enirotali, where two Indian soldiers spent the night on motorcycles.
Two of the amazing kids told them they should start the light.
One of the soldiers took this exit and the tone to which the strike was called and later returned with four other soldiers, introduced local manufacturer Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the basement followed a group of children and killed them with their weapons, bringing victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then fired a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was so badly killed that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, someone burned down a small volunteer committee building and the next day things were still coming up.
About 1,000 young populace men and women gathered at a football club in front of the local police station and the military commander and demanded justice.
They came with a series of hunting lights and performed the waita dance - where they run in the circle and like the bird’s song - the populace Mee Pago.
Several protesters began to attack the building stone.
In an effort to force soldiers, a radio command was issued: “If the tax is tried at least three times for resistance, you are allowed to shoot”, according to the TIME week in an official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Jeremias Kayam (56), chief of the fourth Enorotali Kego Koto, recognized the danger of danger and called the people to go to their homes.
However, no one had a match on his word.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left armpit," said the TIME on the wall of his small wooden house.
Kayam hasn't known who was a shooter yet, but according to his word, a bullet belonged to one of the nearby soldiers.
"There were a lot of people around here and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was arrested three times as a witness to the shooting.
"I ran to the body to convince myself that it is really him," said the TIME weekly with a confused voice of John, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I liked him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "ensure" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said a press spokesman from the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder report was filed by the quadratic media the following day.
Three weeks later he gave Jok to Jayapura a gracious word and expressed his understanding for the family of the victim and promised that he would be killed by violence in Papua.
"I call for an immediate solution to this problem so that he can never repeat it," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for National Security of Wiranto announced that he would introduce a cross-border mechanism to resolve the acts of violence that occurred in the past.
About a minute, they started calling for an excuse.
“Most violent acts have been committed for a long time.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we're going to decide on these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task," he said.
However, in the discussion on 5 June for the TIME week that took place in Jakarta, Viranto claimed that he did not intend to take any action in Papui.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought before the Court”.
Wiranto, who was accused of “crime against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, noted that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Spain, have been reported.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Pania praised his belief with disbelief.
"In the last three years, I have been asked a total of four times, but I have never expected anything," said John.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Pania people who fear to talk about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after which he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the funeral my body started looking for an army," he said.
And the shooting doesn't stop.
In the morning, the Indonesian police shot at neighboring Deiyai.
On the route where one person died and the other 17 were injured, there was between the village and the manager of the construction company who refused to provide assistance in the conversion of a man to a hospital without knowledge.
Ravianus Doww (24), who died on his way to the hospital during fishing in a small river.
Rozzling villages protested in front of the building company.
According to a statement by the police, the hostages were shot after the related stones and their response was alarming.
However, local citizens claim that the mobile Brigade (Indonian paramilitary police) started shooting at the tax and killed one person.
"There's been a panic, we were afraid of reimbursing," he introduced for the 29-year-old Doming Badi, who lives near the hospital and was a witness to the arrival of wounded.
"I didn't leave home for two days."
The Daily Parliament called for the arrest of the police involved and the removal of the mobile Brigade from the area.
You've always been blind to the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the decision-making of native peoples of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central heights.
Many of them joined the Huntia for the liberation of Papua (OPM) - an army of refugees who defend the rights of the popes by attacking and attacking the Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, but they're not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a result of the armed attacks in recent years, thousands of Paniai people have been arrested and voluntarily detained, all under the "ensure national sovereignty".
Some of them are never seen again.
You are known among the people of Papua as “a tragic and forgotten place”.
Oil leads to poverty.
This little rice sold in Enorotal is too expensive for the local.
And bread is also unsatisfied.
Older citizens feed their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaves of vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each is made up of four or five fields with sweet berries.
Most of them are roughly defined for the needs of families, the rest of them sell on the local market.
Ten cups of sugar bean are made up of only 10,000 Indonesian rubies (75 cents).
Since the time the Nabire airport opened more air routes and started to pass new immigrants into the country, economic inequalities between native Papuans and immigrants have developed.
There are so few jobs that usually contain more educated and rich immigrants.
The popes have at least the necessary capital and education to allow themselves to be admitted to business.
"Young people are moving out of town because of lack of employment opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai People's Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden in front of the world.
They also make strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of the year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the pope because of “a lack of cooperation with the authorities”, despite the fact that they received such extraordinary permission to film.
I think China, the representative of the Asian District Director of Human Rights Watch, Jok in his volunteer campaign, promised to break strict rules for journalists and achieving transparency and development.
"The border journalists who work in the most eastmost areas of Papu and Western Papui are at risk of great risk: lack of water and entry into a black list," he said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists indicates that the international pressure on Indonesia in the matter of Papu is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Islamic Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “various and widespread violent acts” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries in the past also supported OPM.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armanath Nasir filed a complaint when he declared to journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people call for foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, in front of a human rights delegate Keesm Van Baarem, visited Jayapura on Wednesday 4th, the local people called on the source that also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the word “we want freedom”.
In 2019 further elections were planned in Indonesia, but the popes claim they will not vote Jok.
"There is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people associated with a gun in Spain," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jok to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of the living army - fight in poverty, hate education and the health system.
The Gobai claim that the people of Paniai, like the rest of the Papuanians, consider their voice to be “a god, ” who must pay to Jok.
"They don't want money, they want justice," he added.
Despite threats and threats from family victims of panic attacks, the last symbolic act continues: they bury the victims on the ground against police and military stations.
I know that justice will never be done enough, at least not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"It was killing a member of our family," Yacobus said with his head covered.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has acquired a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy held 1,46 tons of cocaine at the cost of 256 million dollars in Tichomor.
The shock led to Australia.
A four-wheeled crew of ships, which is apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was closed in the process.
Yachta, named after Afalina, was expelled from South America by the police after her arrest in Nouméa, a Metropolis of the French Sea Territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Reporting Service indicated that it would work together with its international partners to determine exactly where and where drugs were directed and to reject the "Leviathan Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures by which they stopped a large number of drugs leading to Australia," said her executive director Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumé this week.
Australia is due to high street prices of drugs, an attractive target for their feeders.
The country also faces a growing problem of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current legacy is not the first one in recent times.
Last month three men were charged with transporting a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, trying to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't have any sense of humor, they need to remember the drink.
The problem may be in nursing homes, according to doctors from the Geriatric Clinic of the General School Hospital in Prague Pauly Mádlová may be the infusion of physiological solution, which pours into the skin's neck.
But they're still only applied to medical devices.
The older the man, the more the water flows in his body.
"And beyond the loss of emotion, so seniors generally accept less fluid and very quickly dehydrate," Mádlová said.
Two letters should definitely be drinking.
"But getting to an old man so fluid is a big problem," he added.
In nursing homes, she often says that no doctor is looking at it.
In hospitals, dehydration usually occurs with infusions.
"I think even there should be a step forward in order to get a subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to it, the elderly can add up to two half-tonnes of physiological solution.
A lack of fluid can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration occurs as a minor loss of property.
"One day the old man will say that he can't get up from bed, he's talking nonsense," he added.
In case of neglect, it may lead to brain damage.
Blood will be contaminated and the brain's convulsions, it's also threatening kidney failure.
Leukant patients should not be covered with pericardial infarction, maximal infarction.
The problem can also be one-time complaints.
"It's more like a nurse, but it would be ideal for the patient to open up and let the skin breathe," said the doctor.
In Dubai, it burned already under the blackout of The Torch.
In Dubai, on Friday, one of the world's largest foothills appeared in the clouds. The Hassics had to evacuate all inhabitants 337 metres high and 79 patrol buildings.
For the last two years, there has already been a second fire on this tall building, which is not an appropriate name for The Torch (Posodeň).
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there was no harm. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up the alarm, we heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes before we got down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the residents of the darkhouse.
The Dubai Civil Defence indicated that fires were managed by fires around four hours early (0:00 GMT), which continued in the maintenance of the building.
The government representatives added that they will ensure a refund for the citizens who have arrived.
The incident could again raise a discussion on the security of materials used to store high buildings around the world.
As a result of the investigation, which initiated the conduct of Torch post-fire, it was found that the most damage was the location and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
The British police indicated that the London Greenfell Tower isolation and conditioning system could contribute to the rapid spread of fire in a red fire, where about 80 people died.
The results of the investigation showed that more than one of the five passengers to the United States have been carrying prohibited items on board the aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than twenty per cent of them were known or unknown to carry prohibited items via the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on the deck of the aircraft. At least six per cent of passengers entered the deck with a knife or another heavy object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim that they have found that they have been on the road with guns, ammunition or explosives.
As a result of a study carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which responded to more than 1,000 respondents - it appeared that there is a greater likelihood of breaking rules in younger travelers.
Of respondents who admitted that they had attempted to travel knowingly with an object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of those travelling at several thousand hours were compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of Generation X.
Among the most common items that ignored TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents were aware of the threat, while 2.2 per cent of the women interviewed and 3.7 per cent of the men interviewed also admitted that they deliberately brought banned drugs to the airport.
The company indicated that it carried out a global survey to find out how many of them were duly subjected to unauthorized air traffic control and how much they did.
It is not surprising that most people who have sent unauthorized items - whether known or unknown - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are sometimes complicated and fatal.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can carry into the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that the TSA has played in the largest number of legally banned fluids.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would produce books in the same way as the package.
The transfer of fluids is permitted in the context of German years, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on discharge of planned guidelines to reduce Obama’s administrative emissions
After the Agency for the Protection of the Environment has been claimed by the fifteen States, its Chief Scott Pruitt has withdrawn its previous decision on the discharge of the existing Obama Administrative Plan on the Reduction of Oxide Emissions.
Pruitt has presented changes within his plan. It reacts more strongly than previous governments respond to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal challenge to his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline fixed on 1 October when the States should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation for the reduction of the amount of the land area.
In June, Pruitt announced that the agreement would postpone for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "causes with local decisions or threats to economic growth".
Pruitt, who, prior to the meeting of the Head of the EPA, President Donald Trumpem, has remained the position of Public Prosecutor General Oklahoma, has served for a long time as a co-existence of closer environmental regulations.
From the time he moved to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or withdrew the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The urgent medium-term business is the greatest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agency.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the executing EPA exceeded its authority in an effort to remove the inclusion of Obama's administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce the losses of metals.
In the announcement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA commitment to co-operation with the States through complex processes and the fulfilment of new standards within the time frame.
"For the governments of the previous EPA administration, they often did not meet the deadlines and waited until they were threatened by active groups and others, agreeing with the timing and further setting of plans," Pruitt, who in his previous position submitted more than a thousand applications to the EPA.
"We do not believe in the regulation by means of a judicial dispute and we take seriously the deadline.
We never complain about our status and authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt can use “a possibility of dissemination and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that the regulations “will be based on sound policies and best information”.
The Republicans at the Congress insist on a broader list of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month shall be increased by a minimum of eight years for the implementation of the 2015 rules.
The measure has not yet passed by a sitting.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who stood at the head of the coalition of states complaining this week of the EPA, indicated that the group did not agree to allow legal pressure.
"Working in the opinions of the EPA - following our trial - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground area results when normal harmful substances released by cars, electricity, oil refineries, chemicals and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smudge can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists in Pruitt's case welcome the change.
"It is disturbing what pressure it must be to change the thinking of responsible persons and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd, from the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to deal with the ideological burden of Trump's administration, which seeks to help cleansers and special interests."
He's a man of oxygen, but he's not safe under the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
In one moment you're home with your family and you laugh, in the other, you're going to change your whole life from base to base.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar trial was met by Andreas Christopherose from Great Britain, who was wearing a face with an unknown enemy who was finally released from wine.
Information entered the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone in Christopheros knocked at the door.
Andreas said he's going to open up.
He was supposed to be at the door, probably the cook who was supposed to give the wedding present for the family on that day.
Instead, there was a terrible surprise waiting for him.
The man he never saw in his life, immediately after he opened it without warning, he said, "That's for you, my friend."
This disease was inconceivable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I felt just an ineffective skin disease," Andreas said.
His family quickly brought him to the hospital, but his relatives learned a terrible report - the doctors said he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were still afraid that their patients would be infected, which threatened to enter his wound.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of patients were infected with a form that doctors tried to give them together using skin care from other parts of the body.
The great complexity of Christopher became the loss of the eyeglasses.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever lived.
"You can't hide in front of an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he wrote his torture.
Today, Christopher's got twelve operations that are not the last.
Urases that suffer from oxygen attacks may require, according to plastic surgeons, hundreds of surgical cuts and treatment years.
Even after a severe and long period of treatment, the victims have to undergo tissue surgery to the end of their life.
"Sometimes people don't fight and fight for the rest of their lives against deformation and pollution," said Professor Peter Djeewulski, a British-speaking association of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The racer's off.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
The pastor also believed that a man who had sex abused his close friend.
The police searched the whole case correctly and the attacker came back.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, he later changed his values to favor Christopher’s family.
"Three judges finally concluded that the penalty should be abolished, because the man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
In the last few years, the number of attacks on animal substances has grown significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed its concern that it intends to provide new guidelines to state officials on the classification of raw materials.
They should be classified among dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not willing to give up.
They demand that the Great Britain government impose stricter and more penalties on people who attack their environment with oxygen or other animal substances.
They also require close controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often used to obtain in various trades, because it is one of the different means of cleaning.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned the famous mradocrap The Torch, which belongs to the world's largest residential building.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the inhabitants of the 18th-century buildings were able to evacuate at a time and no one was injured.
According to the Cuban police, he fired a fire in the ninth floor and spread up.
According to some residents of the house, however, it was wrong.
"It started in the 67th floor, so they told us," said one of the buyers.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by the Reuters agency, the fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with the raindrops falling.
We're asleep.
He woke us up, people screamed.
"We've been running down the stairs, we've had it from 50 o'clock, about ten minutes," said renter George.
Another witness to CNN claimed that the flames had captured about 40 bytes.
He destroyed at least two cars on the ground when the hot parts of the building fell on them.
About two hours later, according to a civil defense report, a fire came under control.
The reason for his performance is still unknown.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was a flood.
The Tower also destroyed over a hundred rooms in February 2015.
There's about 680 houses all over the building.
Even then, no one had anything to do, because the people had been able to evacuate at the time.
The Torch was founded in 2011 and then became its 352m tallest building world.
The record has been prepared by another doubly mrakokrap next year.
A culturist had in his body 14 incredible doping substances.
He didn't win at all.
According to the list of Corriere della Serra, in the example of the 3-year-old Ippolita, there was a plague of unauthorized resources - from steroids across the diuretic after treatment in Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
He didn't even help this wild mix with the title, finished the fourth.
Now, culturalists are threatening a four-year-old distance and a criminal movement.
The record was 11.
Loni was an Italian dignitary of Davide Vasta successfully tested on 11 doping substances, which at the time was a record number of arrived athletes.
A third player started to take steroids a year ago when he lost his own culture.
Luke Vondračk's in Czech.
She was very involved with the former millennia!
Sotva Lucka Vundráčk's step on the Czech territory, he's in one car.
And he's also paying attention wherever he comes.
Last of all, she fell into the arms of her former lover, Michael Dlouhy, who lived with her for three years.
Herec was 12 years old at the time and had been living with his family.
Lucía was only 19 years old at the time, and she was determined not to pursue her career on the ice.
So they left, but friends stayed today.
This also resulted in a press conference on TV Prima, where they met later.
They both agreed to the blue color.
At first they didn't wake up, but then they drew near, and Lucie laughed at the daughters of Michal, when she fell asleep.
Then they'd get dressed, and they'd call the photographers in a friendly manner.
However, their meetings were not an accident, they also play a couple of miles together in the new series of Prime Captain Exner.
Islamists in Great Britain have experienced the preparation of anathetism.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamic bunker who called themselves the Three Men and, according to the prosecutors, planned a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom participated in the training team in Pakistan and were previously sentenced to similar effects, were arrested in August.
In those days, the authorities thought they were going to attack without delay.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found part of a ready tube bomb, knife with letters that in Arabic mean "unbeliever", and the gun's makeup.
It happened at a time when a MI5 secret service agent was stationed in the service of the remanding device.
"Recent attacks have shown what threat the prosecution could have caused if they were not stopped," said Sue Hemming's prosecutor.
Three reviews at 28, 25 and 33 years may be requested for exemption after twenty years.
A fourth independent, 38 years old, can be done after 15 years behind the networks.
During the London trial, the men announced that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were located there by agent MI5.
The court also listened to her, but then refused to claim the suspects.
Thursday was the best day of the year.
In Hodoninsk, 38.3 °C was indicated.
The second temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on the spy for only two days.
With 38,3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in The Watch Tower in Hodonsk, passed on Thursday, which has become the last day of the year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech hydrometoreological institution.
On the contrary, on Thursday, there were not many hot records.
In the morning, 35 of 145 metrologic stations measuring more than 30 years were reviewed or recorded.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded the record temperature.
Maybe the fourth temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record in The Watchtower.
In January in Brussels on Thursday 37.4, the original maximum of four decades was exceeded, and in Pohorelics on the present 37.1 rates, the record of three decades was exceeded.
Both records came in the same way as in the 2013 issue of The Watchtower.
There were ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, there was the largest crowd in the Dijákovicí in Znojsk and the ship over Dyjja in Břeclavsk, where the torrent was similarly extended to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not disappear.
In contrast, for example, in Western and North Western Czechs, according to the CHHMU website, the fourth highest temperature was only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperature there began to grow until now afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current currency in Czech will be gradually detached according to CHMU and will be able to reach even more clearly on Sundays.
Most parts of Moravia, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and on the south side of Moravia and on Saturday.
China's missing tourists.
Peking's coming for visa policy for billions.
China, after ten years, is trying to apply its influence without using violent means.
Each year it invests $10 billion in support of language schools and the construction of a university in a foreign country, pushes its entertainment industry into the foreign market and tries to attract Western tourists.
But it won't happen to Peking.
The dark state media are talking about the plan to make tourism the driving force of economic change and modernization.
The number of visitors, however, grew by only 3.8 per cent and a total of 80 per cent of Chinese tourists came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Tchaj-wan.
It is motivated by the fact that, despite all its global ambitions, China's civilization is equal to open arms, the world's most recent country of economics professor at Christopher Balding's Beijing University in an article for agency Bloomberg.
For example, which speaks for all is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have an invisible relationship with China, which the citizens of the other countries must have a vision with their ancestors.
In the Chinese offices in the United States, therefore, taxes are comparable to the celebrations of the new year of China.
The visa is $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait a long time at the front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions are a major economic obstacle.
Studies in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas reduces the number of visitors to the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three per cent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than 1 per cent of all citizens, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when it uses the tourist movement to achieve its political goals, such as in the disputes with Chad and South Korea.
When China mixed transport to South Korea in the middle of the conflict around the South Korean opposition system, the South Koreans paid for it and China fled.
In May, the number of visits increased by 42 per cent, while Japan reported an increase of 85 per cent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the U.S. Central Bank Fed, China was able to leave China as a result of its foreign routes to China up to $190 billion, while China, in the context of the sale of exchanges to tourists, will receive about $35 billion annually.
According to the official figures on the development of the payment balance, China then had a cost of $217 billion in the tourism year, equivalent to 44 per cent of the total Chinese trade surplus.
A small number of tourists, therefore, who are trying to protect the capital's well-being, are experiencing a very painful wound.
However, more mentioned factors are only one manifestation of greater sustainability for foreigners.
In many parts of China, no one actually heard of immigrants.
More than a million foreigners lived throughout China in 2013.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
And Japan, which is not exactly a cruiser, has a twin.
A number of scientific work also shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
In China, however, you will not find it practical.
To solve these problems will be politically binding, but the step offered is to simplify the visual device.
Other Asian States, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently developed a great deal of effort to simplify and simplify the visa-sharing procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their strong changes, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the gas station, they multiplied deadlyly yellow beaches.
The Kingdom of Plenary can be enjoyed by the youth immediately by three rare, deadly deadly deadly plasmas.
In the exhibition, the visitors will now see only nine pure native Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, which is 2,000 metres above sea level.
"Average and metro length," wrote the linguist Martin Vobruba.
Young people of the other two species, deaths and graves red, will still be able to collect power in the host land of the garden.
We can't say when people see her.
"Now we'd come up with them," said curator Miroslav Dohnal with the possibility that it could last for a year or two.
Australia's deadly snakes have come to the world eight, the descendants of a traditional pair from the population around Sydney.
"The only visitor they can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals around Perth," Vobruba said with the fact that in human care there is a need for a winter of 6-8 weeks at the temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A percentage of success was performed by the African swimming pool red.
The money in the gas station came out of four eggs of all four young people.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This kind of animal, on its victim's side, is spreading the line up to three feet [4 m] away.
He's looking at his eyes, he can cause him to suffer from blindness.
Young people of all three species live in zoos.
Up to 40 days in the garden are still waiting for young men from black mothers' babies, eggs are placed in the incubator.
According to an unverified record of telephone conversations, Trump creates a pressure on Mexico due to border charges
U.S. D. Washington Post published a copy of the telephone calls of President Trumpa with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview on 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peñou Niet, Trump urged her to stop publicly voting that she would not pay for the building proposed by the wall.
The president of the United States read to him that he was publicly removing the building of a wall, with the words: “You can’t talk like this in print."
The trumpet in his campaign announced that he would set up a wall in the south of the border and vote that he would pay for it in Mexico.
He also rejected his first speech to Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbulm, expressing a profound exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. Control Agreement over the obstacles leading to Australia is "smart" and "study" and he insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which he took over President Obama's government - he would look like "drugated" after he proposed an entry ban on the United States.
Trump's speech ended after Turnbull explained that "this is my favorite day's speech."
Tusk again spoke to the prosecutor for Smolensk.
"I'm afraid," said the President's brother of the dead President, the President of the Government of Law and Justice Pis Jaroslaw Kaczijński.
"I have no fear, Kaczynski is not afraid of me," said Tusk and told the current leadership of the country that justice is trying to exploit political opponents.
On leaving the prosecutor's office, he was waiting for a TV TV TV 24 tax, which scandaled Donald Tusk! and joined politics for hundreds of years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and made sure he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski doesn't scare me."
Prosecutors do not read anything according to their words, but they do not doubt that justice has to be served by the current Polish authorities as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who are not interested in it, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He's already been undercover in the hearing.
The expremier was heard at the prosecutor's office in the area, this time he had complaints about the suspicions of the victims of the Muslim disaster.
In addition, the same came to replace the body in the lungs.
The families were forbidden to open the gates, and there had to be some reason to do so.
And that's why they were afraid of scandal, because he'd be hurting Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relations at every price, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk an important part of the EU," Kaczinski said on Catholic television Trum.
He added that if the conflict with Russia had been resolved, Turkey would have had the chance to get the most important crisis in the Union, with which Poland had just nothing to do with it.
At the same time, Kacinski announced that he had warned German Chancellor Angel Merkel that Donald Tuske could do this differently, but she didn't take it for granted.
The shower has been subjected to eight-hour hearings at the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, but as a witness.
However, many of his statements were considered to be part of the apparent efforts of the Polish government and the head of the PiS Kaczinské to disclaim Turkey as a political rival in connection with various scandals.
In Poland, the Minister of Justice has been appointed as a minister of justice, who is fully responsible for the role of the Prosecutor-General.
The invitation to the hearing came after the election of Tusca, the head of the European Council, who was actively seeking to prevent Kaczynski from visiting the Merkel in Warsaw, but he tried very hard to prevent it.
At the EU's summit against the extension of the Turkish mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová was protesting personally.
In this case, Warsaw was left alone on the hills and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs love each other?
In the southern parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the film from Barmy, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections that took place in 2013.
It's from a statement that manages the delivery of votes in foreign languages.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its updates and is currently in the memorandum.
Four years ago, a delegation was elected to a foreign country of 10,000 Czech citizens.
"Since the last update of the statement in 2013, there has been some changes that should be considered in these lists," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, where appropriate, to change the level of representation," says the material.
The report shall contain two annexes, the first of which are listed by the representative authorities to which the paper ballots are attached.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, then Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a vote list in the press version.
The list of them will be changed.
Four years ago, Cheši could have liked, for example, the Czech Republic in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both ambassadors are closed.
The Czech Republic also withdrew its membership in the Malaysian Bahamas and Japan.
Love won't even be at the General Consulate in Doneck.
This Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are new on the list of Ambassadors in Kenyan Nairobi, the Senegalese capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
In Asia Česko, since last parliamentary elections, has expanded its representation on the general consulate in Irbil and Čcheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S' čchuan.
Voting lists will also be available for registered voters in the Czech Republic in Barmé and Cambodia.
The Czechs had the opportunity to select the delegates at the polling stations at the representative offices or consulates four times.
Before each election, the National Voluntary Commission shall determine the country for which its candidates are voting abroad.
This was the first time in 2002, when a decision was made between the South American candidates.
During the following two elections, Czechs were elected abroad among South-South candidates.
In 2013 it was the same as the year in which the Middle East was chosen.
The number of Czechs voting in the race is increasing steadily.
A total of 3800 people were voted in the premier 15 years ago, about 6700 in 2006, four years later 8222.
In the previous summer elections four years ago, 10,571 voters were assigned to the embassy.
Mascar at Moore's Ford: Activists remembered racist links
Ford Mercuriy, from 1948, passed around the visiting residents of Monroe, Georgia, and coddd through the bridge of Moore's Ford.
Before the car was reached by four passengers with black wool and a white driver, however, a group of white men with guns were stationed on his way to the bridge.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a dirty suit - was deeply moved from cigarettes and looked at the front of the car.
There's a fear in the passenger.
"We want it n--a Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring him to me!"
The silence breaks the river of a young black man, who is cut off from his partner's seat.
This scene is happy only for the reconstruction event that took place on 22 July.
But when one of the men passes through Roger's church of conversion, the promise will be lifted by a blow.
Since 2005, Moore's Ford has been returning regularly to the bridge, a group of activists who rebuild that Saturday night in 1946, when there were two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorseyov - to kill members of the Kukluxklan.
No one's been around for murder.
"It is with the conviction that for all those years the only person has been arrested - although we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyron Brooks, who helps the reconstruction of events to organize.
"It's a barrier to our history and a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman in Georgia and a lifelong warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event is a dramatic challenge to driving, and every year the city community of Monroe recalls that justice was not done enough.
"We demand judicial action and the closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first," Brooks said.
"At that time the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
On 27 July 1946, a court-martial doctor closed one of the victims of the murder at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI, which received a report from NBC News, the merger had to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding periods.
But no one has been brought to justice.
Despite the fact that the suspects remained free after ten years, citizens' rights defenders claim that both causes of exclusion - politics and sex - were known to all the citizens of the city.
In April 1946, according to the decision of the Supreme Court of the citizens of the state of Georgia, the first right to participate in the elections scheduled for the year was granted.
And right during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the farmer had black sails Roger Malcom during the voyages to greet the owner of the land's white sails Barnetta Hestera - probably because of his wife.
In Brooks, it was thought that Hester had married Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on June 25, 1946, the most important owner of the land was the White Lot Harrison for Malcoma prison in excess of $600.
He was sent to the prison by Dorothy and the Mae Murray brothers and George Dorsey.
On his return from prison, just before he went to the Moore's Ford bridge, a group of suspects was building their way.
"As it turned out, the murder planned and organised Harrison," the FBI launched.
"It is also evident that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law defenders who not only participated in the mergers but also released evidence and protected the identity of witnesses."
Brooks has been more expert in the whole matter.
"It was a massacre because of voluntary law," he said.
“Always had a clear subtext for all the local residents of the black wool: ‘This will happen if you register and go to volit’.”
The annual event reconstruction at Moore's Ford is organised by Cassandra Greene.
Its appearance is visible, attractive, and lofty. It shows the depth of corrupted racism, which many would like to consider in modern America to be extinct.
Following this reconstruction is not easy and it's even harder to turn off the air, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about breaking up because we have to deal with the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us," Greene said.
"But the relationship between us can't be formed unless you hear what I had to go through."
The main annual reconstruction trials began in June, and on the first day of the first day, about 30 heroes - thousands of whites, the rest of the blacks - flocked to the room where Greene met with a very well-planned presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is running the assistant director's position.
For many years the leader of Kukluxklan has played a role, but according to his word, it's an exciting role.
"I have a bad feeling because it's against who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of the story regularly, because we never want to go back to such a time."
Herci Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcoma, the Barnetta Hester poet, are playing their role.
The presentation begins with the poem - Malcom agrees with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land--e-e!"
Rascona doesn't.
He's coming for the ride.
At this point everyone (at least every black coat) is smiling.
Greene laughs at all.
"What happened?" Rascona turns away.
He's confused.
Was I too rough?
"No," said Greene's party.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'n-r' to such a tone."
"Exactly," one of the priests will cut off the black hair.
"You've got to have a bigger look at R."
Energy in the room is much better; friendship restores the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants to be presented as authentic, just to be made up for a lot of four victims of massacre.
Hearts are repeating the scene.
Rascona is now paying attention to the correct expression of the word to N.
No one laughs anymore.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Rive, shot... and set up silence.
Women dressed in black stand above the bodies of the priests and sing a tricky song by Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there's a feeling in the room.
On the back of it, about a dozen sightings are tired of the road and the tears from the eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the pledge.
A couple traveled from New York City, many of whom are from nearby areas.
Each of them smells a local wave of wind for about eight hours and Brooks leads to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
By this time it could have been seen as a retreat, but now, standing at the same place where it came to escape, the atmosphere is terrible.
With the last words, he sings out Greene's taxes on the inspection of the body.
Children bow to the victim’s head, follow false blood and the body’s invisible body, and throw something into the ear.
"They're not dead," they say to the little boy.
It's a few minutes away and Greene's thanks for the promise.
The hearts are encased in the lano and the ears are beating.
Bradshaw covers Marbaugha, a man in his suit who played the head of the Kukluxkllan.
Nick Rascona includes his two friends-hers and pays in their arms; finally, his emotions get on him.
"That's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know this role comes to you.
But you had reason for it."
A few days later, he's sitting with the priest for dinner.
In one table, a young white couple are talking about the presentation with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski's sister found words that would express her feelings from today's presentation.
"It's hard to listen to these harsh words and to look at the horrible effects... that people who seem like you and do it because they look like you," said the reconstruction.
"But let me know that disfellowshipping is still a topic," he added, "only the police lines are called."
On the other hand, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the court scene, enjoying dinners and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already begun to plan the presentation for the next year.
"Reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to survive - but it is the same moment of thought," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who don't know and study the history of their country are likened to its restoration."
I like the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use are only a scratch.
I don't agree, anyway.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often resorts to surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instructions for using anything were more rare.
So maybe my first gramophone contained only one paper on which the hieroglyphics were presenting the connection of some parts, in all there were some secret signs.
When something appeared inside me after the years, I offered a list of schematics that didn't want to tear down the back desk.
He's been working with me with a pen, and that paper with a labyrinth is worth it.
Yes, it's been used to help with the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
The game found a broken tape and enabled me to hear the expensive vinyl plates again.
The new era has brought new guidelines.
And a relatively simple fruit grower, where he simply held a broken grep, demanded about ten pictures.
In particular, there was a map with a description of how to insert one piece into another.
The adjustment was double and another procedure was simply not possible.
To give it a good deal of effort, with the need to delete certain plastic parts.
My rejection of the instructions ended in my self-esteem of Seat Leon's character.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with a hint of minor repairs, which included other changes to the flange.
It was simple.
All three steps and the work should be done.
Unfortunately, the author recalled that while the fire was actually going to change in only three steps.
1st cover.
2. Open the empty fireplace and create a new one.
3. Name has been changed.
The left arm had a problem with the location of the battery curve.
At first, I thought I'd put the right top ends into the car's mouth with some gift, a screw that they'd hide easily and then I'd run points 1-3 of the author's surprise book of service.
I don't know. I don't know.
The cover had no place, no space, not even for the narrow hand of the Pollestina, nor of the Slezanic Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, and that's all without any success.
The staff was still relieved by my wife's access to the garage, which called the rice and the words that were heard from my mouth all the more extraordinary.
"What are you doing here?" she asked quietly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, although if I quit the plural terms, there were only two published words.
I'm wearing a scarf.
"Why does it take so long for you?" she threatened a wind that could be her last in the long-term struggle.
Little did I explain to her the problem, and I was primarily complaining about the author's torture process, where the burning of a broken iron on her hand, which she wrote, followed by her urging that she could never write anything anymore, was the only introduction to the broad glass of Claudia's instructions to the witch, including his commission fire at the top of the Los Angeles castle.
"What's the way to unmount this box?" said a woman with a battery mounted.
In the Black Zophalism it came and then steps 1-3 were as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And that's the day my colleague called me, who just walked out of the collapsing station after checking the two officials of the State Medical Control.
I know her as a colleague who has lived in the area as a potential and impossible and who can tell the wild story with unexplained voice.
"I imagine I've been tempted to do not have a high-handed guide," he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually got rid of the whole problem that caused me to think that I had no idea what to do with the patient's toilet.
Its argument to the Commissioner that adults with their hands are able to adjust and that there is no need for pictograms to control the normal activity of obedient people, had no adverse effect and remained a small amount of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simply pouring out the desired flow of water is a primitive act at the level of chromatology that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, is carrying out this order in ten steps.
So it's necessary to report that it's necessary to get out of the water hole.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but finally it's a pleasure to find out that a person has washed his hands just as he arranges for a customer from SUKL.
Finally, I have to point out that I've stopped breathing and I'm preparing a detailed plan to work on the toilet.
In the case of decommissioning, the procedure is one, where there is no problem, in terms of power, given the certain differences in both sexes, it will be necessary to clarify two guidelines.
The problem remains with those pictograms, because creating a perfect process also means a precise range of all theatomic details, which could arise in the original visitor's toilet of certain conflicts, because it can finally be learned that he has opened the appropriate opening all his life in a completely wrong way.
Pearson company leaves more than 3,000 employees and reduces dividends in the attempt to revive trade
On Friday, the British teaching group Pearson indicated that it will release another 3000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme with a view to changing the trade model.
Further exemption, expressed by Executive Director John Fallona at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous company's decision to release 4000 employees within the framework of previous restructuring.
The Pearson company announced a plan to reduce costs of another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to establish a profitable trade resulting from the development of digital education.
The company that voted for its share of the sale in Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann announced that the annual outlook remained unchanged after reporting one percentage increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion libre.
Attack on war in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military army in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier died and several others were wounded, and official representatives were introduced.
There were five soldiers and a silencer, mentioned in NATO statement.
According to informal reports of the attack in the city of Kararabagh, three civilians also died.
This month, Afghanistan launched a bomb attack - in the morning more than 30 people were killed at the explosion in the city of Herat.
On Monday, he killed a suicide bomber near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that it had arrived at the fire blast after the guard had been attacked by members of the Afghan army at “the local person with the home of the explosive device”.
The declaration further states that all wounded soldiers are outside the threat of life and are located in the U.S. military hospital on the basis of Bagram.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Kararabagh region is a significant source of concerns about NATO's related forces in the remote Bahamas.
According to the UN, 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, the bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia cable quarter.
The Taliban was involved in the attack.
On April 31, he killed more than 150 people in the city center. It is the most deadly military attack in the country since the US government invaded the Taliban in 2001.
Violence is already undermining the situation in Afghanistan, and President Donald Trump is considering the increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have occurred in recent weeks by public trust in the government, its regulations and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashrafa Ghanín.
In response to the complaint, the EPA reviewed its decision to remove the rules of competition
The U.S. Agency for the Protection of the Environment has withdrawn its decision on the repeal of the Obama Act, which ordered Member States to reduce emissions, which is only the day after the Agency appealed to 15 States.
In the middle of the night, the EPA notified its decision on the entry into force of the “Ozone Standards 2015” in the words that it proposed the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our national partners and listen to their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt notified the EPA's efforts to remove ozone-depleting standards - which measure the actual air pollution in the specific areas of the country and, on the basis of measurement, define the limits to be met by October 2018.
The group of fifteen from most democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint in the afternoon on the grounds that EPA is illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trumpa urges the restriction of many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trumpo's words, in an effort to achieve economic growth.
However, the strength of the new government has begun countermeasures by democracies and conservative groups who fear the impact of public health emissions.
The EPA on its web pages states that breathing air with the content of the ozone "can reduce the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
Singing Ladislav Bubnár got the morning and the key to blood!
This, in our relatively new song, you may already have registered in June of this year, when this very unknown song was arranged for us at the Czech scale of the monster action, which hosted such former characters as Mr. Karel Gott, Lucie Bilá, Simona Krainova and a number of others, and did not modernise any other action than Leoš Marès.
The purpose was to show the audience and present your musical clip to the song of Sara, whose baptism was just named.
Few, however, know that the only video clip that went through in Russia did not happen without problems, and Ladislav Bubnár’s own song had to be healed.
It was his first big encounter with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and did not go without a proper trap.
The song of Sara is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticness of the scene, he had to mark the face of the face in the video clip of the music.
At one point, however, he was hit so hard and directly into his nose that the young singer had to heal the doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, immediately I got out of my nose," Ladislav commented the situation.
Fellows and producers said the situation was on the ground and Ladislav didn't respond at the time.
Unfortunately, the injury was not so serious that it would affect the continuation of the next attack.
We'll now bring you a young artist's video clip, and you can also record that scene with the title.
Unreported version of blood, however, was not used better.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of mutual dual
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers, who could design the most exciting boxer game in a light bag, first met at the outdoor meeting.
Each of them was located in a private room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, while Garcia - an unexploded champion in the World Boxing Council - did not arrive down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomačenka, the champion in the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia’s victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-year-old World Championship of Adrian Broner in the Saturday season on Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in the light of the game.
Garcia took her lawyer and said: “How's it going, champagne?
Good luck."
On Saturday at 19:00 his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN.
Boxers take pictures and manager Egis Climates adds that the potential boxer file would be “perfect test”.
"I'm an ex-champagne champion," says Garcia.
"I had to pick up with Broner (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
I'm a little boy at my 63 pounds.
I'd like to go back to the light load category.
He's got to go back to get a light load... so we can get out of here.
That's what he's asking for.
Why don't they fill it up?"
It's a little bit of a deal.
"Box would win this game."
The climate has raised a demand for the payment of views - which is part of its strategy. The hunter should complete his debutment in the light of the year and the next year to go with Garcio (37-0, 30 knots), who also expressed interest in the game against the victory of George Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who run on 23 September on the title in the light bag in the Forum.
"The game should run a form of viewing, it's asking fans," said Garcia, who later expressed himself that it was an open opportunity to broadcast the game through a television station that will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attractions.
No one else will take that kind of attention to himself.
We're waiting for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomačenka as "a wonderful boxer" and could attend his Saturday party.
But the hunter didn't give up on Garcia's credit when he said that the champion three divisions from Riverside seemed to be "very slowly... sorry, Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers indicated that they felt a constant pressure in front of each other's breath.
“You just don’t remember this song.
There's no other game that's going to be so much attention.
And I'll add a lot of fun to the fire," said Garcia.
The thief said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A couple of years ago, he disappeared without feet.
Their cars are now found on Volhy's day.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
It's a huge turnout, but it's not a success.
And the police finally stopped the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost pair lived in uncertainty, not knowing what happened.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the whole story came to an end.
The train of their car found a light bottom on the Volhy River in the city of Cheboksary in Chuvašk.
Only thanks to the evidence that remained in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The evidence survived the entire decade under water, without which the police would continue to find the identity of the found.
A couple were last taken when Zirnov stole his father's car to get his friend out of work.
The propeller that the car revealed is still standing in anonymity.
His finding reported to the Czech police that the following day the car went out on the beach.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that caused the idea of a road leading across the river.
However, the investigation continues to reveal further details after its completion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum application in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been described as a new method of ageing, show that more than 80 percent of people were questioned as an 18-year-old, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rätttsmedicinalverket) initiated new tests at the beginning of the year.
The objective of the method is to assess the indicators in the framework of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) has been criticized for the delay in determining the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
By today’s date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was estimated as 18 years old, while in the next 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency found that the question was “may be 18 years older”.
In the following 423 cases, it was decided that the question was “maybe younger than 18 years of age”.
The test shall only be made available if the age of the requested dispute.
According to Johanna Gåranson of the Forensic Medical Agency, results correspond to the previous month.
"On the contrary of last month, statistics are kept in busy sequences and numbers are very similar," he said for The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated at 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and indicated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned is 18 years old or older”.
Svenska Dagbladet's newspaper examined 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases questioned it would be 18 years old.
Critics were also expected to include a medical method of ageing, which includes the X-ray of the teeth of wisdom and MRI scans of knee nodes, which are then taken by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, in contrast, tends to consider the biological age of people to be determined by the age of puberty.
"I had reason to think about this problem and I do not think that these types of measurement are correct for age assessment.
It's very uncertain to call the biological age into question.
If we can't determine the age of precision, we shouldn't pretend again," said the Metro newspaper.
The Forensic Medical Agency Agency's Gåransson rejected the words: “Of course, the risk of mishaping a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person in question is clearly under 18 years of age, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all those in question."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico's phone.
American President Donald Trump, in a telephone call from the Mexican President Enrique Penů Nitov, threatened that he would not meet with him if he was publicly saying that his country would not pay for building walls between the United States and Mexico.
The trumpet in the discussion said that funding would be arranged, even if it agreed that it would have to be secured from other sources.
He also spoke openly with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is reflected in the conversations that the American newspaper The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump made the building of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his Dutch campaign of promotion.
Right now in the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after his arrival at the Trump Money Neta non-diplomatical caral for critiques to his plan on building the wall.
The southern neighbour looked like a growing political problem and pressed the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this," said Trump again in a chat on January 27th, and threatened to cut off contact with the Mexican president, if he continues to publish a consolidated statement.
Finance is kind of what it's going to be, and it's finally going to work out.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to talk to you gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," said the American journalist Trump.
The wall has also marked at least the important thing we're talking about, but politics may be the most important thing here.
The executive order to build the walls of Trump issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico's construction and financing of the wall is rejected for a length of 3200 kilometers, and therefore both countries have been defeated and relations have been lost.
At the end of the March, Trump said that the project would still be paid by the United States.
The storm finally met with its Mexican passerby first at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also announced a telephone interview with the Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28th.
The head of the White House's conference marked a funny one.
In conclusion, it adopted an exchange of views on the agreement in which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees to the United States for the adoption of persons from international installations in the Pacific States.
The trup of the deal first considered it foolish, but later he joined it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost springtime, for example, when Trump considered it a good idea to accept the comments of the members.
"You're worse than me," said Trump.
But the tone of the conversation increased.
"I hate taking these people," said Trump.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in jail now.
"There will be no great people who will go to work for local black people," he said.
In the discussion, he also pointed out that an overcrowd can become an expert from Boston in five years.
Trump led to the end of the winter, so a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world states, often and several times during one day.
The speech with Turnbul finally marked the most pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he discovered that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They fixed the murder of Rany before the wedding.
Her father came in too.
Corrections went to the city of Jemen Sana's capital.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose for his victim a little Ran Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrib sent a girl to his father's house, where he raped her and laid his hands on her.
Next, he raped her body, and then he took her close to the grave.
The violent death of young girls has taken over the whole country, which is facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari became the first of a thousand gifts that came together to be a witness to reform.
Muhammad al-Gahrabi was dismissed under the law of the Sharia.
The father, after the repair, shared his feelings with the media.
I feel like I'm born again.
I got caught.
It's the new day of my life.
And the other members of the family were present, along with the tax, calling out the word "to live justice".
The gunman brought in the police supply that he was pulled out of.
The police put him on the bridge.
One of his officers turned his gun against him and dropped a bullet out of the middle.
The next day's tax was celebrated every morning that was burned.
Mr Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was executed in accordance with the legal system of the country.
"Righteousness, Allah and the right of the wicked have triumphed," he added.
I was at the Rehabilitation Station in Sana and I was waiting for my daughter to be killed.
Then we went to the funeral with our family.
We took Ranino's little body and buried him on a nearby graveyard.
Me and my wife, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been executed.
The police feared that the tax collected at the site would fall into hate madness, murder would fall and commit crime.
The correction was ordered by the Court of Justice of the Chilean People's Republic of China.
At first, however, Maghrib was immediately sentenced to 100 wounds in battle, but his actions raised such charges that the judge decided to execute death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on 27 June.
His family's wounds knew him well.
When the police were looking for the roof of his house, they revealed evidence that his husband had planned his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
And animals would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies and this injury that didn't work for Ranino's body was terrible," said the media.
"Rana disappeared Sunday, we reported it to the police that day, we said it to the news and to all our television stations, crying with her photo everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a guy from the killer parents who suspected their son of a horrible act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body was found.
The wound was going to play out with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he is.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took a car and drove around, but we were looking for a marina.
The people of Yemen were convicted of crime and began to gather before the police station where al Maghrib was detained and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice has read the present report of the investigation in order to satisfy it.
The accused did not apologize for everything he did.
Just before the execution of his sentence, the police had read his sentence, but the judge had just looked at his lawyer for a moment.
The entire event was recorded for national television, but on the Internet there were many records of taxes.
Governor West Virginia announced a change in political parties
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening the assembly of President Trumpa that he was coming to the other side.
"If you like it or not, the Democrats turn back to me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after long prayer and meditation, I report to you today as the West Virginia citizen, that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic Governor."
The presence of those watching the explosions was happy.
"I'll report to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach I can tell you, it's time to jump into another trap."
Trump had previously promised people a meeting in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the whole country, according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice built a great estate from his father and is owned by some of the weak downs.
The value of his estate is estimated at $159 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republic issued a statement stating: "The departure of the Governor of Justice is another morning for a democratic party that puts obstacles to our journey, instead of calling on our country."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governments and controls at least the legislative authorities in history, the announcement of the Governor of Justice is the last arrest for a party that has already been defeated without a leader who is seriously forced to find a positive and segregating report," stated President RNC Ronna McDaniel in his statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe commends Russia's "reverent" apology for the doping scandal
Former outstanding sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a fair apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athletes Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which was held on the night of the MS in the athletes - that his country was right from the world of sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who came in this way for gold and silver medals."
Despite his comments to the members of the IAAF Congress, he voted in favour of the ban which entered into force in November 2015 after Russia supported the recruitment of its athletes from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reports.
"I think that today we were witnesses very sincere in answering and presenting," IAAF Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and the Congress were pleased to have Russia admit his mistake and work with all the strength to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also “happy” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintegration.
"I think we have made a lot of progress today and we have come to another step, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis state for the observance of the penalty imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate positive athletes from those who are bad," he concluded.
At the MS in the airport starting on Friday in London, it will compete under the neutral flag with 19 Russian athletes who have fulfilled IAAF's strict rules.
The head of the IAAF Rune Andersen crisis department said on Monday that Russia must still meet several criteria before being allowed to return.
The drugs presence tests are still ineffective and the trainers continue to carry out their activities, said reporters in London after the closing of the IAAF Council's presentation.
The CzechTrade State Order has obtained Františka Savova, whose state is in progress.
The public order of the CzechTrade state export agency was issued by the Young Front Front Františka Savova.
Officials gave him a percentage of points in all qualitative criteria.
They were not surprised by the fact that the Czech state is taking Savova for tax purposes and asking him to go to Czech.
CzechTrade's pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued a thorough public ban on four-year editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total of 30.8 million kroner was ordered by the Young Business Front of Františka Savova.
However, the Czech police have already charged it with tax fines in 2014 and is in pursuit of it.
Savov moved to Great Britain and Czechs are asking for his release.
In the case, the server warned Currently.cz.
The award of the contract was based on the original criteria of CzechTrade to decide from 60 per cent the price offered and from the remaining 40 competitions and the quality of the project.
The approach to Savo’s company has clearly helped that second criterion.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz has achieved hundreds of points in all partial quality criteria.
As a result, she was moved to another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who then offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated 404 900 kroner per month, VLM offered 324 350 kroner.
Unlike the Youth Front, it was obtained from observers in all qualitative criteria of the weighted average, total of 62 points.
Tendru continued to participate in BDO Consultant and R-Media digital agency, which belongs to the same server as Currently.cz under the Economics.
VLM’s exposure to the result of the trend has led to several objections that its assessment is considered to be non-ferrous and insufficiently justified.
Following their withdrawal, they decided to attack the competition in the Authority for the protection of the economic competition of the EEAS.
It is thought that CzechTrade was in dispute with the law.
"The tenderer is convinced that the tenderer has reached a decision on the selection of the tenderer on the basis of the interest rate of the subjective assessment, namely, the favourable participant of the Young Front, i.e., for tenderers and other tenderers," he wrote in his proposal to initiate the procedure submitted to the EAGGF this week that the server has published Currently.
According to the Director-General and the President of VLM Michala Klime, the selection commission is considered to be an incredible and a percentage of the project of the Youth Fronts in all its members as being excessively suspicious.
"Each independent observer must consider such a remarkable success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," he pointed out for the Current Climate.
The CzechTrade hasn't shown up yet.
The CzechTrade Agency is essentially not commenting on public orders before they are closed.
All information about you mentioned prohibitions is in accordance with the law of the employer's profile and in the Public Order.
"After the end of the contract a full written message will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express ourselves to it," said Dotyk.cz's media representative of the agency Štěpán Longway.
The young border responded to a statement that considers it extremely problematic that the issuer of the Economy has entered an article in Current.cz into a competition where he has his own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that Article.
In a tender she could help by providing the BusinessInfo portal in the past four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martin Cuba ODS.
Frantishka Savova blames the police for the tax fines in relation to the excessive payments of DPH to his company, which have caused the Czech state allegedly damage to up to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic has asked Great Britain for its release since 2014.
According to Savo, his criminal chief, ANO Andrej Babish, is responsible for the influence of Mafra's publishing.
The London Court of Justice of Loni Savovo's appeal against extradition has been dismissed, but the businessman has refused.
"In our view, the case has not moved anywhere from London, from Great Britain, we have not yet received any understanding of the matter of acquiring the legal power of the judgment," said the speaker of the Prague City State Representative of Štépánka Zenklová.
In addition to the property of the Young Fronts, Savov in the Harvard Limited company was represented by a seat on Cyprus, which was controlled by the Cheskobudjevic Pivovar Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as a investment fund, purchasing threatened assets.
The government would also have a thriving Heavi Machines Services company, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the development of property from some Socialist youth.
The motorbike went through the streets and the park, ended up in the basements.
The driver turned his attention to the streets, railways and parking lots in Ossović.
When she started looking after him, she decided to take her to the station.
"The police men followed up with increased caution in the city, when they did not manage on one of the next roads behind the Marians Lazní and drove the motorcycle into the field where he was driving," said police speaker Daniel Dvorák.
Finally, he had to fly to the gas station.
The police found that the engine was not self-propelled, the registration marks on the motorcycle were deleted, its production number was deleted, and the self-contained product was removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"The alcohol presence in the driver has been removed, but the test has found a positive result on the methamphetamine substance," the police speaker added.
How the financial rules of the football influence Neymara move to Paris
The rules governing the financing of European football clubs will never distort Neymar's record transition from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalisation for Paris Saint-Germany will be carried out by an EUFA organisation which is responsible for European football teams and has the right to ban the participation of teams in the prestigious League of Masters.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules , which introduced UEFA in 2011, suggest that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transition has not been financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only to buy Neymara out of its contract and Neymar will require payment in a few tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
Given the fact that the PSG team is funded by a rich hierarchical family that has enriched energy sales, Neymara can be allowed to bring so many star football families.
Clubs may be lost for the purchase of large numbers of players, but on the other hand they must show legal sources of revenue, allowing them to cover the government costs of commercial activities related to the football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platinin after reaching UEFA's senior director's office in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that owe themselves to the new forces would ultimately undermine and risk the bankruptship if banks or owners refused to guarantee it.
In 2011, the FFP rules focused their attention on the Club's debt to monitor their losses.
This change meant that the commercial model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with a potential and lost a horizontal sum for players and built a global sign - it was not immediately so useful.
During the current three-year period ending in 2018, clubs can show up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinin had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Alexander Čeferin, was determined to refuse the ban on excessive losses.
"The FFP has continued to pay and we are determined to strengthen it in the future," he introduced last week for Associated Press Andrea Traverso, which looks at compliance with the FFP rules.
Although PSG has purchased the purchase amount of Neymara in a single payment, the amount may be distributed for the purposes of calculating the amount for the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be cancelled at EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions was imposed in 2014 by PSG along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG carried out a fine of EUR 60 million (82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and the order to reduce the men of the League of Masters for 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25 players.
UEFA pays attention to teams that can try to attract financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies connected with the owners of clubs.
Although the cash company sponsors PSG as long as funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amounts.
In 2014, UEFA joined the same measure, which decided that the amount of financial resources provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of the Neymar revenue in the PSG could be charged by the MS organizational commission in the 2022 photoball in Qatar according to some reports.
However, PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar announced the fact that Neymat should become a MS ambassador in the fotball and that such a manager would easily expose UEFY manufacturers.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to enforce the rules,
According to UEFA's air-expressed dedicated persons, Neymara did not initiate any investigation in the case of Neymara to PSG.
The source of this report sought to remain anonymous, since it was not justified to comment on the situation with PSG, the Agency The Associated Press introduced it.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and EUR 542.4 million.
The accounting statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a great opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling dress.
The club shall undertake an increase of up to 30 per cent from the signature of the contract.
The representatives of the Spanish League, apparently worried about the departure of one of the largest stars, began to measure Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG violates the FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of the 'financial doping' club and the state," said the president of the League Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the company's ownership of the PSG charity.
Manager Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnet, shares La League's position on the financing of the club.
"It is the result of property that has changed the football world in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as the owner of the club becomes, everything is possible.
Keeping the rules of the financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests at the participation of such players in its club."
Sppartan Ambassador Rosic: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Six thousand hairy fantasies.
Tomaš Rosic is on the beach.
The same scene as the Sunday fight against Bohemians.
The Spartaan depositor spread out against the Red Star game, invented several chapters, but his associates did not go to black.
The flight team, fueled by new multi-million forces, will end up in European fires after the initial doubles.
Was it hard for me to agree to do anything else after the Bélehrad branch?
After the incineration, four shots had to be shot, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted to keep up with ourselves so that we could get out of the next game.
We had some chance.
We need to work together as a team and play our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get in the back so long?
The game's very well-trained.
The combinations of rivals were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we fired about once in a while.
Of course, it's a little scary when you have to win two or three balls.
The second half has been much better, we've been able to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push the opponents more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the system?
Of course, it's one of the diseases when a new husband is created.
We've only played three competitive games and we're still changing.
It's about the coach finding an ideal unit to sit down.
Are you surprised that you've already played two games for yourself?
It's still just part of the chase.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can play it all the time from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that occurred in the Sparta?
We have to be, or it's not.
It's the same as injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't go back.
Sparta decided something, we have to be optimistic, or the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back to the big deal, but they went to the explosions.
What can you show them?
There was a wonderful return here, just like Bohemko.
I'm so sorry we can't make them feel better.
Give me something they're coming for next one.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here five years ago.
Can the season be at least an advantage for the league?
We're still fighting ourselves, we're fighting, we're fighting, so that's not the benefit for us.
In the case of an extreme tax fine, the businessman has to sit ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the difficulty of Jiří Toman's business, who has had a significant amount of ten years in prison for failing to pay taxes.
The estimated damage is 645 million kroner.
Toman, in his difficulty, claimed that justice violated his fundamental rights, effective finding courts in Zlyna and Olomouc are simply incomplete.
The Constitutional Court, however, noted the difficulty of the independent, found ČTK from the court database.
The U.S. is no longer a court of appeal.
"It cannot be considered as a fourth instance of effective or legal errors which have been expressly allowed by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was close to the top.
Verdit is legally valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the District Court in Olomouci.
At that time, Toman was in the publishing press in Argentina, where he found himself, according to the finding, during the EU decision.
The penalty imposed on the upper limit is the legal rate, which according to the value corresponds to the resulting damage.
The Court of First Instance noted the case as an extreme tax fine, which has to do with the macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as president of the World Service company from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million korunas occurred only during the winter period from June to June 2008, and according to the scientist, the total amount exceeded billions.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Tomman for the whole part.
According to the claim, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax recognition.
The place of monthly DPH and consumption tax in rows of at least 10 million kroner paid tax in only statistics.
The World Service and some companies with whom the company was trading have a relationship with the election board, which the court has determined for the DPH machine in trade with the underprivileged sizes of 13 years of imprisonment.
He also rejected his plight before the Constitutional Court.
The series “Flight to the Non-Fraud” and “Comrade Detective” play on the nostalgic side
This story is nostalgic as for the positions of the famous 80s; so for the 90s (when the genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy chart "The State"); and of course, for the modern age, especially the year 2001, before stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehherer, and Paul Rudd broke into larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a simple parody and also a strengthening of our modern facebook eras of lasting memories.
From a French point of view, it looks like someone's breathing.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, it can be a story of the appearance of a talker with the green one that H. Jon Benjamin mentioned).
The authors turned away from the main funny points - the middle-aged priests who play raising children - and couldn't get away with the past.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later”, in which adults play adult netizens so much on the emotional level and satyrs are places up to date, including parody on the thrills of the '90s as 'Ruk on the bicycle'.
In one moment, it will be located on the Apple Powerbook complex, a bicycle brush and a “sustainment of other things since 1991”.
A lot of major history lines are being repeated.
Well-being Coop (pan Showalter), now writer, has not yet moved through his love to Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a panic.
It's not about the crazy machine that includes Ronald Reagana (also Mr. Showalter), who's the founder of George H. W. Bush (very well composed Michael Ian Black).
As always the best parts of French are many more stories.
It is particularly fun to watch young Rudda forever with long hair alias becomes Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, sometimes with Andy's respect for the old paper.
France could start the moments of appropriate madness, such as the "Seven Up" series should be repeated until it meets what I would expect to be a logical explanation: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the whole group finally goes out to the "A Year to the Non-Discrimination" Prime Minister.
"Comrade Detective" in Amazon will apply to another type of nostalgia: revivalism studied in the series "So normal American", the film "Atomic Blonde: Without Lithium" and even the series "GLOW" in which the icons are depicted in the east and west of the resurrection scene.
The comedy of the artists Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in the Rhyse Thomas regime is a television scene: a drama of two Buddhist police from Romania in the 1980s who fight for the truth and atheism through Marxism-Lenism.
The main role of Gregory and the idealist Joseph is to play Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, who contributed to the English language Channing Tatum (activator of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
I'm sorry, but it's not too much.
In some jokes, you laugh (like you need police watching chess on television - parody on American football).
The series delivered its voice to many famous clergymen - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, is too focused on the inexhaustible propaganda drama - which includes the murder with the mask of Reagana - and it also seems.
Six long episodes are too exciting and comedy moments are not enough.
In the short term, propagandaistic satyrs in Comrade Detective could function, for example, in the scene where Gregor and Joseph once again visit the United States, in which two fatty hamburgers gathered at a large gathering.
A clear message for the imaginary communist promise is that Western culture can change everything in the city and organ.
The thinking of the Romans was not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with them.
The planes were not expected to break the IAAF ban.
The International Athletic Federation of the IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of the Russian trainers because of the State supported by the docking programme.
The vote in the event of the World Championship, which will begin on Friday, was expected to be very unanimous.
For the extension of the ban, 166 delegates spoke against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the delay is the fact that Russia is unable to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as noted before the Chief of Special Investigations, IAAF Rune Andersen.
His team recommended that the order continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not been heard yet, and trainers still work in the country with the enthusiast.
A fully functional history is not even the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA that does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can carry out a test under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Even when progress has been made, there is still a lot more work to be done," said IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so the Russian athletes came outside of the London Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
By order of the incoming MS, 19 Russians, who had already proved that they had been tested longer than the Russian anti-doping system.
But they won't be able to start in national colors, and in the event of victory they won't play a Russian himm.
The Bank of England will support the interest rate of 0.25 %
The Bank of England should be informed, as expected, that the rate of growth will remain unchanged, following an inexhaustible economic growth and the weakening of inflation, which has contributed to speculation about early growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “backward” in the context of maintaining interest rates - despite the expectation of family budgets.
The policy makers of the Committee on Change Policy (MPC) Banks England voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0,25 %. The results of the vote on the increase in the rate of interest supported by poor growth supported by the low rate.
In its Annual Report on Bank Inflation, the Bank proposed growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and guaranteed that the decrease in family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to grow below 3%.
The Bank also pointed out that, over the next few years, there should be growth due to the inflation caused by Brexit, and also indicated that it would have to grow in financial markets more than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of the removal of the part of the mother-in-law, whose task was to support the economy, which was introduced into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above mentioned above, it should start to pay from the next spring the Terminated Financing Plan, which will offer interest to banks, although the Bank of England has indicated that the sales of the planned $115 billion will now amount to EUR 15 billion less.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: "MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (HDP) will be included in the short-term view with a emphasis on real household income and consumption burden."
On the basis of the Bank's rate, it will be necessary to "remove monetary policy descriptions" to slow inflation, which is "in higher terms" than the markets expect.
Markets currently predict the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank pointed out that any growth would be "acceptable" and "limited".
The Bank reduced the forecast of growth for the year and the next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in the spring.
The expected growth in 2018 remained unchanged by 1.8 %.
After publication of the findings, the librarians against the dollar and the euro.
Freedom of choice is 0.5 % of $1.31 and 0.4 % of EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after the alleged increase in hopes of further growth - HDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter of the turnover of 0.2% in the previous three months.
The trend with high probability will remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter, although by the end of the year, it should be gradually increased according to the Bank's statement.
The latest report on inflation is an unexpected result for households with high inflation rates and a massive increase in wages. The Bank indicated that the situation is even worse before growth.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the reduction of income in the coming years, but it is expected that they may be "excellent" at the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow thanks to the great interest of the British market, thanks to the low libre, which compensates for lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This Decision came into force a year after the last year in August, which was reduced to 0.025 % in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in the decrease in librarians.
The Bank concludes that the full price and economy merger takes at least four years.
Before the decision on the latest rates, many requested increased rates with increasing inflation, which further increased domestic pressure, and three policy makers requested an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation last month was 2.6 % of the red 2,9 %, although the bank indicated that such a change would be expected and that in the next month the inflation would have to take place again.
The Bank indicated that the overcrowding relative to 2 % of the target was "all" due to poor librarians.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, pointed out: “In view of the recent fall of swap rates, it appears that competition on the mortgage market will only stop as long as the creditors begin to agree with the ban with a positive view toward the end of the year.
The market seems particularly good for those who end up in existing contracts and repeat mortgages - the offer offers are free of charge, just like the low rates they get to cover."
NHS predicts a controversial HIV treatment in 10,000 patients
Patients are given early access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention on the basis of the Supreme Court’ decision to finance NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) pill used before sex and reduced the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86 per cent will be offered through the health service in approximately 10,000 patients during the three-year period.
The NSH agreed to finance a period of trial after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands with the statement that NHS has financial resources to reward the PRIEP despite the declaration that the remedy should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was adopted by NHS England from the mouth of Director-General Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) decision described it as a ‘relevant moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to take patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure propylaxis (PREP) is a treatment of HIV before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among threatened patients.
The pre-sex application indicates that there is sufficient number of specific medicines to prevent infection in the patient's body.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among tested patients are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinical authorities shall identify capable participants who shall sign consent with the participation in the testing, including men, women, transsexual persons and partners whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registering in GP in the United Kingdom can also be enrolled in their local sexual health clinics and have a potential participation in testing.
The program comes to tax taxpayers for $10 million and NHS England signed this week's contract to distribute medicines after obtaining international public orders.
The experimental period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PREP, its objectives, use and implementation in a large measure.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be complemented and fully difficult to continue to expand and further the more successful prevention of HIV.
It is another lover in more than thirty years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnesses of the decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered properly and in patients at risk, it may be possible to change the English HIV epidemic.
NSH is offered from a range of patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool, which is individually controlled and independent of the need to talk to a partner, leading to improved quality of many lives.
We accept this declaration with joy.'
Ian Green, executive director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The first number must be rapid testing across the country; we must ensure that it is accessible to each patient.
We now have an experimental PREP medicine and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
The Ministry of Health Sharon Hodgson said: ‘PrEP’s beginning of the test period is a welcome and long-term change after months of expenditure and maintenance by the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be part of our access to HIV prevention and the end of this life-threatening infection.
The next tests will bring us closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP.
Now it is important for us to start tests first throughout the country and protect so many people who are exposed to HIV and thus end HIV spreading in society."
Life on high feet: mezipatro and smart design changed this small apartment at Earls Court in a local house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with your property, changed a large house in 2014 in Knightsbridge to stay at Earls Court.
It is located in the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is a visual display of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
"I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the fourth Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
"I've looked for something more reasonable.
I found this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height.
I fell in love with him, and I fell in love with him for a few more days."
Since then, it has been the size of 1,000 meters of complete renovations.
It's easy to get into the bedroom, you have to go through the kitchen, and Joanne wanted to add the floating space and mezipatro to use a high ceiling.
“I used a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
These were my demands," she said.
To this end, Erfan Azadi from the design and design study of Duck & Shed was sitting in Notting Hill and used a nearly four-metre stop to create houses that were not only a project but also a place to live.
The stage did not reach such heights that two months would pass on to itself - a challenge for architects so it would be to create a interface that would be able to move forward.
Erfan had to involve his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is all complicated," he explained.
“We had to set up both spaces so that we could go straight.
It was not only about setting up a simple platform, but at the same time to fire the steel structure so that in a proper height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two fully-fledged rooms for himself - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the meantime, it resembles a beautiful living room of an old painted frame in the design of Retrouvius.
The gold-coloured, silver-line and retro-luster Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of the mirror plays an important role in dramatism, space and lighting.
The short walk is measured on both sides and looks so wide.
The mirror list in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
In the entry doors, the storage spaces are located on the ground for the conformity of goods and stairs.
The exit of the living room, which will provide the whole house with a significantly larger area, is possible to separate it from the kitchen if not used.
The closed kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique to this solution, however, are the door.
"We had to solve the technical page," Erfan says about the walled breathing doors.
"The door is designed to prevent it very easily."
Thanks to the understanding of the use of space and storage spaces, Joanne gained another 16 meters of square, second room and a better total separation.
"When it comes to it, what you sell is the usual area - or the valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real micrometer shall be calculated at the entry into the apartment at a reasonable price on the basis of the living space."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space in maintaining quality materials that provide a luxury view space.
"The material is very important because you are touching it and creating an emotional relationship with the home," Erfan added.
“You don’t admire electricity generation in walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get it."
As shown, the quality design and expansion of the living room can change the normal stay on an extraordinary job.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between the states of the blue and the red is widening.
California declared the ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid for it and announced a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, there is no prohibition in the full sense that citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout the United States.
It is clear that California has prohibited the provision of state funds on the way of its citizens to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this nonsense?
California is strong for LGBT and any evidence of non-compliance with the life-style LGBT is considered to be discriminatory.
Tennessee, however, adopted a law on the benefit of consciousness, which states that psychotherapy, which has a moral problem with treatment of patients from the LGBT community, does not have to provide it, however, has a duty to provide these patients with another therapy that does not have such a problem.
Texas and other States have also adopted laws that the religious characterist organization who received children from their mother after adoption does not have the responsibility of providing them with the same sex.
As a result of these laws on the reward of California's conscience, it prohibited the financing of its citizens' roads to eight countries of the Union from their means.
In practice, this means that California professors should not have access to scientific symposia, for example in Texas spread from their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On the way, they have to get either federal grants, but it's absurd that the federal government has financed the roads of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsoring.
The state of Tennessee has come to be patient and its Parliament has adopted the law by which it also dislikes California's high taxes, high government expenditure, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it is still in California because of this travel embargo that does not pay tribute.
It is used as a guide for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen against any Member State of the Union, which, on the other hand, would order a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
The fact is, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing anti-substantiation.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reward of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go and what they will not have.
Second, what's wrong with revenge?
If the hunter has a problem with selling eggs, why can't he offer only cows, pigs, pigs and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell him under the penalty if there is enough of the dealers who offer him?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces anti-discrimination complaints and a high order because he refused to sign a dot on a gay wedding.
However, it also refuses five Dorsts to Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you put him down and leave him in the room and the appropriate doors don't order him in the hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can own internal, domestic policy in powers that are not federal, to be adjusted according to their own, i.e. to the preference of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
Only California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states are California too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community have sometimes rightly argued about tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rules of life and let them live where all intelligent people should be guided, but some activists never seek tolerance against themselves or others, even extreme intolerance against others.
They think that no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if he does, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're the newest enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history when the states were doing so because of political issues, except for one case.
Even in times of civil rights strife, where North and West were on the side of integration and Jih on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
For one thing, it was 50th - century C.E., the political cause was childhood and was committed to the war of the North against Judah.
Of course nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the state of the modern democratic and the state of the Red Republic is widening and the United States is mentally breaking in.
Unauthorized agitating.
Critic Putin's got a mass test.
Russian opposition policy Alexei Navalnyj received 300 thousand rubles for breaking the rules of the campaign prior to presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court tried him because he invited people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, he organized two major anti-government protests and announced that in March of the next year, he wanted to become the head of the state.
The Chief of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidate, but it is generally expected that he will do so and win again.
The officer said the police came to him in the morning and took him to court.
He did this because he invited people to the video show on YouTube's Internet portal.
It looks like three thousand.
"We'll get them out of the court's pay later," he tweeted on the Twitter critic Kremul.
The Russian Voluntary Commission has recently concluded that Navalnyj cannot participate in the presidential elections because he has previously been certified by the sponsors.
The defendant, who is considered a fighter against corruption, is, however, responsible for political motivation.
In the case of over 300 thousand rubles, 25,000 rubles were also placed in court on Thursday by two members of the Naval Prefecture Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolay Liskin.
He went into Russian politics as a anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the disintegrated opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign at all times.
He was sentenced to a five-year sentence for stealing a wooden company from Kirovles.
In May, the appeal court confirmed the verdict.
The judgment is so powerful that the Navy defends the candidate under Russian law.
Brothers fight empires worth over 500 million dollars
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of their Italian family empire, are considering one of the most expensive Victorian properties in the value of $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis live on the Toorak Bridge, only three rooms from his younger brother Paula, who fought for joint property and trade names to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business already in 2014, but the sharp struggle is still under way before the highest court.
Together with his mother, Anno, his own brothers had a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first trade bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family of Westco Jeans was founded, which grew to the river with 160 stone trades.
In 1999, the entire company sold it for $85 million.
Other properties and family portfolio De Lutis now include offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, dwellings on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and the shopping center on the property.
Paul owns about one third of the assets of the company, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is “a prominent power and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns not even two thirds of the assets.
The court records indicate that Colin owns $316 million, while Paul maintains property for $176 million.
For Paul, the problem was the direct distribution of property and financial resources.
"Colin's proposal has been clearly expressed in my eyes in his favor," Paul wrote in a local court statement in 2015.
The last Friday, after a few failed attempts to make peace, was the first sitting of the Supreme Court.
The brothers now also disagree on who will rule the existing business - from which Paul quoted Colin's statement.
Colin argues that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement with some property.
In the previous local declaration, Colin indicated that he believed in a positive solution to the conflict.
"My Italian reason tells me that the family is one of the most important," he wrote.
The costs for the trial are high. The website of local announcements, e-mails and messages from the company, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, provides access to lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and prosecutors on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her former husband, Luigi, were Italian passengers who had been carrying milk bars and refrigerators since the 20th century and who bought a garden in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with the jeans.
Colin said that when he stole Westco "in the last year of high school, Paul was a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the estate to the son of the deceased would take place in the best possible way.
"Luji often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis's family group. Colin indicated that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke's 26 million dollars on his departure.
As Paul pointed out, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation. ”
Colin has since been back, despite the fact that he is an ex-member of the AFL club, as he introduced in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire is known for his television personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisov and their lawyers on Friday.
He only answered Colin by means of a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to resolve the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of Colin's court statements, he indicated that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very upset if he saw our current situation," he left to listen and added that "he still hopes in a positive solution."
On Friday, all hopes were lost.
"Our disputes will be resolved in a quick time of trial," Colin wrote.
Weather in Czech.
Teachers feed children.
The MHD drivers pass water and summer clothing.
At Mother's school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now coming out on Mondays.
The school is after the reconstruction and the exposed trees are still not providing a big stone.
There's no pool there, but the teachers of the children go to the bathroom.
The children will remain in the classrooms where complaints are brought and sealed bonds.
The air is trying to maintain a clean air, because the air is empty.
It's also useful for teachers and cooks.
"The heat that is in the interior and outside, exceeds the hygienic limits for maternal schools, so in this period we should not even have an open service," said the school director Miloslav Makovicová.
In school, there is an excellent corridor, where the temperature moves around 40 degrees.
We blow up in the morning after 6:00 a.m., the windows are closed, and we're on the south side of the complaint that we're protecting.
"But it can't help too much," he added.
Better conditions are in the forest school In the Games in Hostivíčí, where children spend most of their time outside.
We've got growing trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We've got a beautiful flower there, there's a table under it, and we're doing different things," wrote the school director Barbara Kompano.
Teachers try to go to the forest where there's more bread.
The child has a soft head and has different games with water on the program.
"We have a manual pressure questionnaire that is used for flowers, and we use it for children's feeding," Kompano said.
The director of the maternal school in the streets of Novoborská on the Prague Proseku Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers are trying to keep children in the shade and the bodies are water.
"We have a relatively growing garden, so they're under trees," she said.
It's coming out tomorrow and then by 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a headache.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweet tea or a served juice and have a drink with water on their garden.
Each day they also have fresh fruits and vegetables to eat and for every day, which their parents sometimes bring.
"Maybe a mother here today brought about a ten-year-old melon for the children," Makovic said.
Drivers get water or the same year.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot days of water, ice drinking or summertime.
Drivers' cabins are tramping and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, says the Greek DPP Aneta.
They are air-conditioned in addition to the cabins of some trams and in the travel space.
Tramwa's high temperatures have never been seriously damaged.
A small injury occurred in the castle of Hostivarí.
At the present high temperatures, we will give the driver sufficient volume of drinks in particular.
"A glass of drinking water is available in all skis, skis and trains," said the Greek.
In trains and in some parking places, employees have a sodomites that produce a glass of sodomites.
Leaders also get loosely protected iron drinks.
"They can also use an annual uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily changes," added the speaker.
The hot and dry days of the last days have resulted in an increased number of fires.
In the morning, the building was liquidated throughout Czech, and the 12th of a long day’s average.
On the morning of the day when the temperatures in Czech Republic fell over 35 degrees Celsius, he was in charge of a major firefight.
"The fires in the natural environment, as well as those that are connected with the winter work," said the spokesman Nicole Zaralov.
The impact of fires on firemen did not even change the night of the fire when the fires and fires were burning around the place.
In relation to the storms, the builders had a total of 236 reasons.
It was particularly about the removal of fallen trees and plants.
"Most of them have taken refuge in the Middle East," Zaaralov continues.
But it was also necessary to help the refugees in Stockholm, Českolopsk, where 60 people from the children's camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Purgatory survivors.
In the afternoon and in the middle of the night, there were ten cases of food of oxidized cheese.
That's why people should let their heaters check, protect the rescuers.
Oxide is a colourless fluid without a moisture that relaxes during imperfect heating.
The symptoms of malnutrition include nausea, vomiting, headache, and a feeling of restlessness.
In the event of a suspicion of an island, the frozen area should be left.
Trumpo's new head of state plans to limit the president's medical diet
Many people have tried it before and have always mocked.
Maybe John F. Kelly really does.
If you do, it'll be the first one.
Portal Politico pointed out that the new head of state in the White House is planning to limit the information of President Trumpa - including reports on television reports - in hopes of keeping Trumpa on the cold.
Here's part of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new headmaster of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day in the new function, he raised the key issue of the White House Trump, who was trying to make: incorrect information from the president.
Kelly told the employees that she must personally accept all the information - whether on paper or on a speech - because the president can decide better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis really makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors took over Trump's control and his media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media is a few decades back - and now, when he sits in the White House, his habit of watching television is even stronger.
"If Trump was a candidate divided into honorable reports, it was appropriate to show him that in a positive light he talks about a lot of other media that was easier to convince," said the former campaign leader for Politico Sam Nunberg.
Tara Palmeria, from the Politico portal, then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in the background - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media on which he is being praised."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to express his views on Twitter was "under control", however, is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something else they don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more exciting if someone didn't control them.
Of the tweets that Trump never sent, we'll never know with great likelihood.
If his employees were able to keep him at least several times in the back, then their efforts would not go unnoticed.
However, no one has been able to stop Trumps regularly for a long time to deal with controversial issues.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of the opposite factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agency by putting material - which they can but must not be independent - which supports their views on the world.
The Portal Politico, which covered the problem on all sides, published in May a report on the appointment of advisers to present false information to the Head of State.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's reporters:
"The current and former officials of Trump claim that the president has often responded veryly to the negative media reports, especially the reports on the only information, and urges them to find their source.
This situation came to an end when someone supported the president's copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of Professor Charles C. Johnson - who accused the deputy president of Katie Walsh's statement that he was a “source of many uneducated information” from the White House.
No matter how Johnson was always exposed to charges on Twitter; or that he did not submit his testimony to any evidence; or that he had already published false charges in the past, and later called them.
The trumpet read the article and started asking Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Reince Priebus and the Secretary of the White House Rob Porter “has tried to implement a system for the management and documentation of information that President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now trying to cross the same strategy three months later.
It may seem that he is more effective than Priebus, but Trump's impulse will not just disappear, and his assistants are still very much opposed.
These constant factors of Kelly's mission will certainly be very difficult.
Tourists agree on the arrival and return to the "Millions Square"
Several of the most mobile owners of the house in the English county of West Midland will again be set up against determined tourists who join local authorities on the right to return to the field after their stay.
Tourists rented 20 caravans on the ground in the floating street of Solihul, which is a 'millionaire quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and army of caravans, tourists return after what they have shown in the spring. They did not leave a shelter which was dug on the ground under the regulations of the authorities to prevent their arrival.
The tactical group found mercenaries in the army and landed on the field with the unguarded mercenary that served as a router.
The fourth citizens attacked the city council of Solihul with ‘the ability to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wanted to stay anonymous said: ‘ They took this place on Monday night after they moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at the rest of the people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Last night they got more and today they'll probably get more.'
He added: ‘Birmingham's board knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I do not want to continue to play taxes until the correct advice with tourists is delivered.'
Another anonymous citizen said: ‘It’s funny. We have recently watched the last visitors and now they’re back.
And this time they're more and this time they brought horses with them."
Solihull, a press speaker, said: ‘We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the ground near Street Road and in cooperation with local police we are taking the necessary legal steps towards a sustainable solution to the whole problem.
In order to gather as many evidence as possible, it is necessary that the most local citizens have reported any non-cooling or anti-political behaviour on number 101.
We'll get a whole face that we'll introduce to the court."
The husband of the European Parliament hit the car in Brussels.
He brought him a government special.
The government special delivered the wounded Robert Žitnánske to Bratislav in the middle of the afternoon.
Two satellites were waiting at the airport and the plane was under constant control of Slovenian doctors.
A long-term planned flight was uncomplicated.
Robert Žitňanski, according to information on TV JOJ at the beginning of the summer in Brussels, had a serious accident.
First, he got hit by a car and he's been in serious condition since then.
After the transfer to the office, one of the patients in Bratislava was transported to a specialized workplace.
The economic analysis is the wife of the Slovenian MEP Jany Žitnánski from the NOVA.
She didn't want to tell me about the incident.
He's got three kids together.
Italians agree to fight the saved NGO ship with immigrants on board
Italy notified that it would take the entry into force of the rescue ships of the NGOs which join the Italian border with immigrants from the Mediterranean if the NGOs did not sign a new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue in their operations," said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin dail La Stampa.
The warning came the day after the Italian authorities took a boat from the German rescue organization Jugend Retett because of suspicion of trafficking with people, which clearly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates in the first year, refused to comment on the whole thing because of the charges of the Italian state complainant Ambrogia Cartjee.
"It is for us and will always be a priority of the number of human lives saved. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at the same time," the organization introduced a statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all the present charges after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Yuventa board of Jugend Retett since October.
Her crew suspected that she was carrying immigrants who were handed over directly to the people, and it was repeated.
At least one meeting was reported by the applicant only 1.3 miles from the border of Libya. During the meeting, Italian media was published.
The ship crew suspected that it had violated the law and had been visited by an Italian coastal guard who was looking at rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian surveillance, more than anything else.
The code of conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board the ship, such as Yuventa for monitoring activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have already agreed with the maintenance of the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last-named organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary, but are acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or interruption" relating to saved operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct, for example, has been rejected by the Organisation of Doctors without Borders (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, it has been noted that the sudden decline of immigrants in the last few weeks, which occur in Italy in the context of rescue operations, indicates that efforts to strengthen the surveillance of Libya's borders and cooperation with local elders do not produce fruit.
"In the last days we start looking at the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
It has also set out plans for another meeting, which will be carried out this month with Libya's oldness on economic development initiatives, as well as with the representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Unsatisfied Mesaroše: It was covered with silicon and cellulose!
The great summer days are full of pleasure, taking on only the most important thing that covers the most intimate parties.
Only Dominica Mesarosh does it.
On the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where it is a hero, moderators, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, just a haze, his body is stuck in the mini-along.
And there were only a few regular movements and the model showed everyone their silicas, but also a thank you.
He beat her several times between half and half, and he turned out to be so high that she had to keep on handling it.
Of the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present, she was definitely not in need.
Michelle Cartero is judged for sending text messages to the suicide victim Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for committing suicide by means of text messages and telephone calls.
The 20-year-old Michelle Cartero will be sentenced to 15 months in a double-year trial for networks and then five years in a conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June to the indiscriminate murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 June 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is upset.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was released until the decision was reached.
It threatened her until she was 20 years old, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter's standing at the hearing on the spot with tears in his eyes, his hands covered and his eyes directed toward the ground.
"Your horse killed Conrad Roye," the judge lamented.
"It ended his life to take you to yourself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"No results have been found."
However, the legal representative of Carter said that it was “the unfortunate circumstances that he was impatiently suffering”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or age or even mental impairment does not have a significant impact on her driving".
Sadly, Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, read the report: “It won’t last one day for me to lose my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care about his sister, and together we'll suffer the unhindered pain that we'll carry with us forever," continued the announcement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Royo testified that she's "following" her knowing that she's never going to be a non-participated brother of the wedding and she'll never be his aunt.
"The loss of the person I've seen since my birth is the disease I've brought to life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law that would make a person responsible for the murder of another person.
Carter's car was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the 7th car.
The event drew attention to the whole nation after the text reports of Carter were published, who committed suicide.
"I need both to jump out of the building or fall down, it's one of my own," he wrote in the text messages that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was allowed to leave his family.
A few minutes before the murder, she wrote to him, "You have to do this to Conrade" and "It's only going to hire a generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz pointed out that Carter was paying attention to Roy's death and ordered that he keep any comments in the press.
The occasion raised many questions.
One of the people who stood on Carter’s side was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to the murder of his British roommates in Italy in 2007. Two years ago the charge was released.
Ms. Knox (30) made a statement in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not imprisonment."
The audit will manage up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to the removal of the island
A few days before the announcement, the Audi car manufacturer BMW indicated that he would offer his customers an update of software in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent possibilities than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Minichov, which is a BMW seat - which consider the ban or the restriction of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will adjust three million Mercedes vehicles throughout Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted a high level of use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with the ETS Regulations.
However, the oxygen dioxide released by diesel engines is considered as carcinogen and can cause asthma.
It also increases the cost of the vehicle to install a device to neutralise gas emissions from diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of vehicles.
While German car manufacturers are headed by thorough visits, Chancellor Angela Merkel's head is accused of exorcising strong car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, who, in an attempt to meet the emission limits, installed in their software vehicles, which, when testing, reduced the amount of emissions issued, was disabled under normal conditions.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, former driving thermodynamics of engine development department in Audi would be arrested.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian nation and does not rely on extradition, so he can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of the year, Audi joined the German police in criminal investigation of Volkswagen's car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was to be subject to European emission limits - and expanded the charges that Audi is leading to in the United States.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make an independent part of the Volkswagen profit.
The plane just got on the beach.
A man and a girl are missing.
An accident occurred on the beach Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC Noticias said that the plane was close to the people on the beach before I arrived.
Some people from the beach apparently fled before danger to the sea.
Two people failed to escape before the machine.
On the beach, according to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died.
"The plane was hit and they were dead," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nation is not known yet.
Two people were on board the plane, two of them were taken alive from the accident, and the police took them to the polls.
D11 abbreviated as not setting the distance.
And are the distances in Czech really complete?
I'll ask you a question.
It's not enough, even though it started to happen in 1978.
Even if it's not available, it's still working.
And it must not continue to be established, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the terrible distance D11.
At least for a few months, the next stage of her pregnancy has again halted the spread of the Earth’s Children.
We're going to get out of here and get some distance from the bones, like they're breaking the salami.
They're hiding the pack and then they'll see when and if we get another one.
We don't want anything weird right now.
We just want a short ride and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from the neighborhood and the city.
The endless journeys of trucks are right across the city of Jaromèr or Náhod, which is not as reasonable as the object.
Only the last step has been taken in 2008, and it has been nine years since.
From that time on, not even a piece of cake.
So as soon as the remaining four kilometers of the King’s Temple’s uncompleted entrance began with an archaeological investigation that would begin at the end of the year, you could hear the sound of the bells in the eastern Czechs.
No one ever believed that.
Last week, it turned out it won't happen this year.
And maybe next year.
The Children's Landing Club for a sustainable transport from Brna has also provided a discount.
The children of the country are recapitalizing their D1 tactic.
The decisions on building permits were taken throughout the scope.
They shall request a review of all the binding positions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the city magistrates, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Office of the Interior.
So, with the D11, we're going to eat a little bit of a village with a famous name for the Christmas.
So let's eat, just go along the street, and we're standing on the next train, and we're giving priority to getting to the colony next time.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
Déssive, still a successful trip to Benezev, D1 or D8.
Everyone's got their lunch.
What do the Earth's Children require?
What is the basis for the problems of the building of communications in Czech Republic?
And why is the existing remote network virtually impossible?

Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandules became a symbol of Provence in the southeastern area of France, but are now threatened by climate change.
Levandullis suffer from dry weather and harmful smell, causing fear to the faces of researchers and pharmacists who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, a professor of agricultural research at CRIEPAM in Provence, pointed out: “Provence is threatened because in recent years this plant has been exposed to changes in climate that bring less conflict on the market and on the ground.
This affects the life of the leukemia.
They also have their own wines and bottles carrying micro-bacterials, which are presented in the dry air."
There's a lot in the bag.
Levandule loves tourists and oil produced from them is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers grows less, less noticeable, and often weaker plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these solvents is considerably lower."
The solution may be the most effective distribution of water and the reduction of water flow from the ground, but also the flow of moisture to the protective mixture of iron and water and the removal of more types of waste from dry weather.
The press has highlighted growing threats in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce week regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss the news about the disturbances that are taking place in the Sinaloa area for the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and non-cooling drug wars.
However, today, despite recent developments, it is primarily due to its own security.
They know it's important to change their habits.
Two responsible journalists talk about what would be safer: take your children with you to the office on which someone hit the border in 2009 or leave her home.
The security team wrote on the black table three simple words: opponents, neutrals and allies.
Journalists ask that the name be given to each word - there is no need for any evidence, enough to use imagination and predict.
Choose from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - the catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal proceedings.
Violence does not cease and the body rises to the mass throughout the country; journalists remain among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, they are at least 25 from the position of President Enrique Pena Nita in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven countries, they have been killed seven years ago.
Among them are the co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drug trafficking.
His loss is painful, although his presence is all-progressive - a large picture of Valdez with the letter “Justice”, which shows the mediator, high in the middle of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years ago, have a trick with Valdez's photo with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place about two months after his death; journalists talk about each other’s traumas, nightmares, sleeplessness, and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to address the case of journalists, two suspects were raised by the Committee on the Protection of the Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will be informed of the violence that takes place in Sinaloe; and yet that the destruction of the country is still very harmful.
Without information on the murders and without a view of justice, the meeting of security is an unforgettable one, says Ibarra.
"It's crazy to spend time at such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we won't trust anyone."
On April 15th, Valdez left the center of Riodoc in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He was able to take several blocks when his red Toyota Corrolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him by 12 shots, according to all the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
Then the shooters got into his car and picked it up from where it was made.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind him.
It seems that in Culiacan, the mountains are spreading quickly.
In Valdez's case, however, there's a suspect silence.
Since Guzman and his summer release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest warriors in the country, as the rival fraction tries to fill an empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the victims are full of two-fold bribes for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Remember for a moment that the term “adjusted” means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with expensive ports and important routes that travel to the United States of drugs.
Unfortunately, just as Valdez was confidently aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director Riodoce still regrets that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that he made two mistakes to his death.
First, there was an ubiquitous conversation with Damas Lopez, the leader of one of the anti-drug cartels who led the war with the son of Joaquín Guzman.
Peace could break the children; suspects of members of the gang collected all copies of the news at the time they arrived at the bottles.
The second mistake was to stop Valdez from leaving the country for his own safety after the entertainment of other news in which the same story was published.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and at his death he was regarded as an important champion in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had to live so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that he would never change.
In the Noroesti period, he was practically vitiated when he decided to sell his share at $50 in 2003 and set up with five colleagues in Riodoce.
In Sinaloe "it was impossible to drive a journalist and not mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually received a good report for state and fair reports; the news began to come.
Newspapers were happy to leave behind the problems and publish texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated by the reading of stories that no one else had dared to publish.
Eight years after the installation, Riodoce won Maria Moors Cabot's prestigious evaluation for a report on Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Assessment Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its state report on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was scared.
"I was afraid of my life," he pointed out when accepting the prices.
Trade with drugs in Sinaloae is “the way of life”, Valdez said in October of last year in a talk for Rompevento TV.
“You must take on the role of the journalist – or play on the stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do in front of death... why didn't you tell me what's going on?"
The employees of Riodoce are running after Valdez. A man was known for his intrusion and non-repute language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and objects - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all sat down on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo's bar against the office and sat in the same table.
Now they ask: Did this routine of his death come about?
His death in them also raised questions about his own priorities - how to do your job the best and stay alive?
“They do not like you when you pay for their wives, children, clean shops, secret parking lots.”
"These things were prohibited," Bojorquez said.
This leads to high levels of self-censorship and self-sustainment.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like he's not playing anything here, his hands are gone.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "which is the point that can hurt... and then came to that thing with Javier."
The old rules, according to him, are no longer paid in Sinaloa - just like in the States of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and the other states, which are home to the toxic mix of lucrative pasta, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones in the rooms where Riodoce employees meet; a few days ago, there was also a demand for government to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Before the building, two police officers found a hole in the wall of a nearby tree before the fourth floor.
They were elected by the state for the protection of the Riodoc office, which is located in the four-storey building in the rural area of Culiacan.
Journalists are concerned whether these police are not equal to 50 per cent of the law defenders who are according to the statement of the corrupt government.
It's been a couple of months since the press finally landed in the hot areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first of these was the murder of the brother of former boxer Julius Caesar Cháveze in Sinaloe.
They are also subject to suspected government expenditure incurred in the home city of the State's government.
Recently, too, several orphans came to one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state representative's office.
Officially, no one knew the identity of the unsuspecting people or the circumstances of the riot, so the journalists were on the alert when they wanted to write about what every city's citizen knows: that restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the said restaurant was registered on behalf of a certain policy, which is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), governing all levels of political scene almost all over the past century.
Several of the rulers of PRI were recently accused of corruption on high posts.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán left the military base unit.
More than a month ago, readers would read about this subject in the Valdez novel, which was the best source of information about foreigners.
"Valdez would certainly have solved the case," said Villarreal (46), which is thought to be "El Flaco" for his rigid position.
"Now all the informers have turned back to us."
Valdez's office was transformed into a cedula warehouse and an attachment to protests against the killing of journalists, and the employees were definitely not expected to be active in the printing process.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez died several weeks ago, and the following morning, she went out to show up at the State Representative's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoacán State.
The authorities claim that based on DNA analysis, it's about Adame.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and shout at the corridors and buildings of the SOS press.
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is visiting Washington a day where he seeks international support and attains justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the government of Sinaloy, which took place the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of following journalists and their killings to make the truth known.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another division of concern that her anger could threaten her innocence.
The Board repeatedly pointed out that Mexican journalists are "confirmed" by organised crime, corrupt officials and the media.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by drug cartels but also by ordering policies and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media survey group of Articulu 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to hide you," Ramirez added.
They're obviously working.
No one remembers the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who arrived six years ago in the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a contract signed by the cartel Zetas: “This is what I have done for my report. ”
According to her head, she had a keyboard and an earring.
Some areas have decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, with a seat in the northern borders of Chihuahua in response to the brutal murder of the rapporteur, Miroslavy Breacho.
The rest continue, just as El Mana of Nuevo Laredo did after his manager's death in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly described the drug cartel article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists broke out of their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, just as it makes you feel that someone is still following you.
And journalists have been monitored and killed, for example, in the case of Rubena Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women living in Mexico City, three months after a run out of Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and do not give up their jobs, each day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a witch, admits that he's afraid to write about drugs.
"Mexico's going to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday afternoon and the employees of Riodoce are sitting on a walker in front of the office - the latest edition has been sent to the press - drinking beer when they start calling.
It is found that 19 people died near the beach resort in the city of Mazatlán while the gang members and police were shooting.
The flag shall be lifted, just as many links left in this field of trade union.
Journalists publish this news from the mobile phone on the Riodoc websites.
It won't be one day and the initial title will change again.
The sound of the police sirens indicates another shot.
Bojorquez takes an summer look at police surveillance to make sure they pay attention.
If they're afraid, they don't give it a clue.
Under the wide portrait of the late employees of their periods - whose mediator is an express slogan for the whole of Sinaloe - all Riodoce employees follow his steps.
"How can we just think about leaving," Bojorquez said, "when I was killed by Javier the same day, one of the interns asked me to send her to the street?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a juice, no matter how scary it is.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first discovery of the amazing creation of the size of the noserogen, which has perfectly preserved the remains - which experts called ‘Mona Lisou dinosaurs’ - found a Canadian mountaineer.
The others were kept in such high proportions that experts were able to determine the reddish color of his skin and indicated that dinosaurus had a "dangerous past".
The article in the newspaper Current Biology stated that it is one of “the most significant history of the world’s exposed dinosaurs and one of the best types of dinosaurs. ”
Zkamenelin is a new species of beetle in the Nodosauridae family. Dinosaurus lived in the Creed period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfect record of record shocks researchers who described it as a ‘stupid effect’.
According to National Geographic, it is now the most well-founded treasure of its kind.
It is found that Shawn Funk, who left the stoneline on 21 March 2011 on the floor of Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberty.
He found something that looked like a strange object and decided to examine it closer.
Zkamenelin was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have spent the following six years working on animal recovery from the vast coast of the country of weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of work, dinosaurus is ready to be removed.
'It's about to stir your eyes a little bit, and you believe it's asleep,' said the director of Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
‘All of a sudden it is written into the history of history as one of the most beautiful and most popular types of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.’
A study of his skin researchers found that this excavator - although he was covered with burning and reminded the walking tank - was likely to pose a serious threat to massage dinosaurs.
The weighted dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect the predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
The teammen claim that it allowed him to get better acquainted with his environment and avoid his enemies. The masking system indicates that he was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years of old dinosaur Nodosouridae first appeared in the news in May. At present, it is available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Boraelopelta markmitchelli, according to the technique of the museum of Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team with a thorough detection of fossils.
Thanks to the amazing state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document samples and forms of soap and burning throughout the body.
They discovered a masking method that is often used today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is unusual, researchers are surprised because Borealopelta's size is far from overemphasized using the same technique.
It is possible, then, that dinosaurs were such a multitude of traitors that evolution gave rise to the premise of masking before confrontation.
Many modern pets with mascots - such as jelen, bean, bean, or peas - are much less and more vulnerable than the benefit, which means that the nomodaurus had to fight for his survival.
“The transmission of the vast and heavy dinosaura turned into a visual picture of the dangers posed by the predecessors during the course of the race,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds contained in soups also revealed that the dinosaur skin probably had red blood cells.
Researchers continue to study animals and look for more information on his life, including the preserved contents of the complaint to cover his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell to the river after his death and was taken to the sea where he fell to the bottom.
At the same time, in the area of Alberty, there was the same climate as in Florida today, and rivers and oceans flowed much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in the perfectly preserved preserved skin and, at the same time, it is preserved in three dimensions and so can you see its original size,” Brown said.
‘For these reasons, animals appear to be practically the same as at the time of the race.
You don't have to use your imagination to build it; it's enough to stir your eyes, and it looks like it's just sleeping.'
In the days of the quake, the presence of terrorists, massaged dinosaurs, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tirannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this twisted dinosaur could be a favorite for his equally terrible ancestors.
Acrocanthosaurus, 11-5 meters long monster with a load of more than 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest discovery was published in the journal Current Biology believe that the body of Borealopelta was flooded into the sea after it was mumified in the pool.
It is found that Shawn Funk, who left the stoneline on 21 March 2011 on the ground in the Suncor Millenium near Canada's Alberty.
According to the museum, it is the most well-founded dinosaur in the world, including the skin and the burning, which is more complete than the chain by the neck.
The animals reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
They made two 50 cm left of it.
Researchers believe that this expositor has broken down the land of Canada today until he is finished in the river that flowed him into the sea.
His underground grave kept his body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this type are also kept to the extent that the charged payments are still covering the rest of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote back for National Geographic, “finding such a learned unit can be compared to a lottery prize.
As long as I'm following him, I think I'm looking for a shock.
Fossil residues of this type are also kept to the extent that the charged payments are still covering the rest of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upward.
I can barely count the shoes on his walk.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrello broke down all over the body.
On the day that she arrived in New York, St. Louis and his cousin moved to a room in Airbnb and made contributions to Facebook on his phone.
She got caught up in a contribution from some high school.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," stood in it.
She was surprised that no one else had signed this contribution, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoh constantly tweeted contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, who shot a white cop in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's body, which lies uncontrollable on the street from where no one took it in four hours.
"It's crazy," thought Ferrello.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put her phone back to him tonight when she watched tweets about people gathered at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and kept the inscription "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son" in his hand!
She followed the live news - one of the police stood in front of a group of protestors, holding in the hands of the leader and at his second end of the shooting dog.
In another video, another policeman, as he pointed out, held a gun that was pointing to the taxes and said: “I will kill you all... animals. ”
"It's not normal," said Ferrello.
"This is not the kind of murder we used to and we can call it normal.
I smelled the skin all over the body.
"I was divorced and crying."
She just stopped talking about her return year and left home the next day.
When she arrived at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they were going to go out to Ferguson in the morning.
The experience of Ferrello and Ferguson during the following three years describes the new document “Whose Streets?”, which will be introduced to the cinema on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, the strength and indifference of the people living in the community who turn to the street and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell's dialogue with his daughter - dressed in flower dress and the same flower shirt - on the subject that they had discussed many times before - "of experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now, because the police killed 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"It didn't take into account that I wouldn't take it with me," said Ferrello later.
"Today's events are a surprise... to what happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it in her own eyes and grow in it.
It needed to develop not only in activation and organisation, but also to identify the difference between different types of experience with black people and what we need to do in order to be released.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which racism does not exist in her own skin, she is not in any way superior to another black girl.
I feel that if I protected her before this experience, I would only hurt her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was the South Florissant Road road against the police department, which became the basis for activists who expected the words of police officer Darren Wilson on his random involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrello met his daughter with a local businessman who was preparing for another meal.
They prepared food for the bags and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrello, he gradually began to have a new type of activity.
"My activism returned to the top of my feet on 9 August," said Ferrello and added that during a high school study at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and she started taking health care and food into the black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrello met with a later co-founder, Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farar wanted to "document" the events that were happening.
Ferrell, however, said: “Do you work on the document or try to find a story that will still be used?
Such scepticism has led to the community through many people, often whites who wanted to commit disease and decision - making.
Folaana explained in the recent discussion: “We have heard that the voices of people born and growing in Ferguson are very often forgotten and we wanted to change this. ”
Folayan had already engaged with co-founder Damon Davis, who is known as a local artist who is involved in the subject of prisons throughout the death.
His participation in the project also interviewed Ferrello, along with six other local residents who were watching the “Whose Streets” team in the years following Brown's murder.
"In this document no one speaks for us, but it is our report," said Davis.
"It was important for me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrello's experiences - in an attempt to show that the hunger "is not about a rescuer, but about the community's approach," Folayan said - it was shown that it is just the most likely to participate in the filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrello's life, for example, as she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like ours," said Ferrello with a smile on his face when she thought about the first time she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this work and to clean up the blacks, I must open up."
The experience of Ferrello also highlights the role of middle black women in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter.
Two of the three founders - who responded to the murder of the Trayvona Martina teenager in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves fans.
"Black middle-aged women in leadership positions in the final outcome are behind the threat," said Ferrello, "because we continue to fight more and more borders.
Black middle women must bear the burden of these events."
Folaana agrees with this statement and adds that "the arrest is actually supported by black women and a large number of middle black women."
However, it remains that "this is not only an affirmative matter" and Ferrello is not the main source of the document because of his views.
"It was just a powerful force and a source of energy," she said.
“that it appeared in the preceding lines is not a coincidence, because life on these cross-borders in the skin of a black rural woman is dangerous.
You feel the energy of this energy even before the screen."
In the meantime, back in Ferguson, TV stations destroyed their position, but heavy racial tensions between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell's recovery takes two and a half years to block the distance during demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area called the home described as "Nepordek."
Still, it does not stop in its effort to get engaged from the moment she was three years ago to the streets of Ferguson.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to celebrate.
We need to love and support each other.
The only ones we can lose are our chains."
The Colins burned the field.
In place of dozens of passengers, he also helped with the cart.
Near the Czech border in Kolinsk, between the towns of Bylana and Liblica, the forest burned from 14:00 a.m. field of 15 hectares wide.
Fire broke out around 15:15 , the builders declared the third pillar of fire from four possibilities .
According to the spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, the fire from the air helped to blow up and turn.
At 18:00 the fire was made fire to the firers, the fire caused damage to the 700,000 crowns.
Ten of the professionals and volunteers fought with the flames on the site.
The fire was caused by a technical incident in the engine compartment.
Hasit also helped a wheelchair, which completely carried out six glass of water.
"We have handed over the owners until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. the unit of volunteers will watch him," said Holomčík today.
And Becoming Resemblance: Art creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is now located several faces of different distances - white, black and snow - covered from the ceiling on the streets. Each of them appears from the previous eye.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the mouthpieces and hair that Chelsea Manning sent to her.
Manning's samples were sent from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where an ex-analytical was reparated by 35-year-old punishment for misdeclaring the secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, launched on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines its experience with technology, IT and art, and Manning's transsexual and pro-pronouncing dissident, whose punishment reduced Obama three days before leaving the presidential office of the United States.
Algoritically, DNA analysis of Manning and using 30 portraits to detect how a man with this genotype was created by Dewey-Hagborg's brain, unless an intellectual comment on DNA's submission - as well as the many ways DNA can interpret - and the incomprehensible determinism of these interpretations, as well as the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered as a woman since her youth. It was judged in 2013 on the basis of twelve complaints, including six infringements of Spanish laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were kept by the prison staff. On the public she disappeared only one black photo in lower quality, where Manning's, apparently worried, is sitting on a seating driver in a platinum blonde pair that is now connected.
In 2015 there were still positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
Under this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various Forensics - such as non-combatable cigarettes and candles - to create a picture of possible types of these people.
And right now she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"Chistali interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add the article to the portrait," explained Dewey-Hagborg when opening a new exhibition.
However, visitors and photographers were not allowed to contact Chelsea with the question of whether she should be interested in DNA portraits.
Articulous and its sealed walls have been framed for two years through correspondence.
They even created comics called Supppressed Images, an illustration of Shoil Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was neglected and could participate personally.
President Obama actually asked for the release of Mannings a few days after the commission was issued, which has been a welcome change in the military prison in Kansas for several years.
It is interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is conducting a war with people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to build up their tweets in areas that should support them.
In response to the question on this special occasion, Dewey-Hagburg stated that "all is happening for some reason".
Under an artistic declaration on one of the Gallery's walls, Manning's famous signature (the letter “i” in the title is derived from the heart) after the end of the “inactivative fractionation of gender, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the other hand, the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the pens C, G and A letters are recorded.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleoids, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary of art), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how amazingly similar, at least on the biological side, we are all.
"I hope that people will learn that our genes do not depend on who we are and that genetic data are subjective and that everyone can post them," said Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA reports a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a private room, is the only page of the above-mentioned graphic novels.
It depicts Manning, who boasts in the way of King Kong from the United States Discipline Barracks prison with megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you from reading, they win," she writes.
"Never hide yourself."
"It's a direct copy of one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
"When I think about it, my hair's cut off."
Manning's history of the exhibition did not reveal itself - which was foretold in a comic book - but when this happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genome-like features, set up as a gift for Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including about 160 cm high of Maning's high salts, on which its genetic haploscopes are listed in the complaint.
"They were placed on walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to feel the tax," said Dewey-Hagborg about the portraits.
"I wanted to point out the mind of the mass movement that took Chelsea's image and freed her."
Professor of North West University and employee of Oxford University sought for murder
In those days, the National Council of the North West University and the Oxford University employees who were suspected of killing a man who had been found dead in a luxury chician apartment introduced the police.
On Monday, a arrest warrant was issued for the murder of the first stage of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, states the account Cook County.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several sub-rangs.
The Chicago police reported that the dead body was found on 27 July.
The police were warned about this fact on the phone. After arriving at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the houses with several market branches.
Cornell-Duranleau was reported to be dead and detectives investigating the case as a murder.
Lathem has been working on the position of a professor of microbiology and immunology of the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the public relations university, indicated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now authorized to administratively and has been banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The entire business is now being examined by the relevant authorities and the University of North-West is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
The language university and Somerville College introduced an e-mail message: "The British police contacted us and we are also ready to help the American police."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were completely shocked and moved to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, a public contact with the Chicago Police Department, pointed out that he was calling for suspects to appear to the relevant authorities.
"Police has information about the place of their stay and the effort to reverse suspects is increasing," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting police in the pursuit of suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the building manager Grand Plaza, who was warned of the incident to arrive in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it's not clear if the incident occurred on 27 July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The Director of the Grand Plaza issued a statement for all residents: "Police is now working on setting up a time review and profile of the victim and examining various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Russian Government President Mutko
The President of the Russian Government, Vitaly Mutko, indicated that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At the present time, some of the new plan criteria have already been met and RUSADA has already obtained the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko introduced on Thursday.
The mayor commented on the second part of the WADA project leading to the Code of Conduct - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutka's code, there's nothing to worry about Russia.
“All has been announced and will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the above criteria is called after a public announcement of the results of the WADA survey conducted by Richard McLaren, on the reported monitoring of the arrest of Russian athletes from the government.
Mutko said on this subject: “We know the investigation because our antidoping system is clearly in place.
It was accompanied by all measures.
However, there were no national programmes in our country, and we can therefore not confess to anything that never existed."
Mutk's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
In the Russian RSport Smirnov’s discussion, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping factors, but added: “In many cases we have indicated that the report contains a controversial situation and regulation.
No one plans to accept the report entirely without a reward," Smirnov concluded.
WADA submitted RUSADU from the opening of the drop-down controls in Russia in November 2015 without delay in front of the drop-down scandal.
However, the organisation has allowed the planning and association of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Dumping Agency (UKAD) in June.
After a visit to Moscow centre of organisation in June, General Director-General WADA Olivier Niggli indicated that RUSADA is "on the right path" to refund.
The police charged three people, one is young.
The police accused three men of setting up a fire in the middle of a traditional wooden church in Trinci-Guutech on Fridecko-Misteck.
One accused is young, all three are Czech tribes.
They are threatened by a common threat until 15 years of imprisonment.
Newspapers have said this today to the Navy Police Officer Tomáš Kužel.
He thought it was a deliberate criminal act.
"It's very clean business and the police are currently working on the whole business," Kožel said.
He said the police would deal with the possible arrest of the accused.
Other information may not be published by the Director.
"I can't communicate anymore because the workers are actually working on the matter with the criminal police and the investigation and the State representative who monitors the matter," Kužel said.
In the 16th century, the wooden church of God’s body in Gutech began.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and pictures from the first half of the 16th century.
There are significant damages, according to previous estimates, to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is quantifiable.
The flames began to be considered as a re-surgence of the church.
Most of the costs should cover insurance, other costs are prepared to share with the Ministry of Culture and the City, the public collection is also prepared and the memory owner's contribution is calculated, and local fertility.
A similar wooden church of the Holy Caterina of the 16th century in Ostrava-Hravo also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
That's what led to the launch of an electronic installation.
And then, in his place, there was a copy of it.
State counts with citizens in the defence of the state.
He's supporting their training.
With financial support for the actions used in the defence of the State, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, it shall take into account the permanent purpose of the law on the preparation of citizens for the defence of the State.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been commissioned by the government, pledges that this will increase the physical competence of Czechs and their capabilities that could then be used in crisis situations.
This is reflected in the proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law had been adopted in the future, the state would have put hundreds of millions of crowns in support of the defence.
The basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system, which would help to enhance the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the state, in addition to the performance of defence duties and on the basis of volunteers.
The State, for example, would support, financially or materially, the cooperatives of radiomators, shooters or cynologs and would allow them to increase their membership capacity.
The payment would provide information on people who are willing to come to the country during the crisis and their abilities or material equipment.
Accreditation could also be made available to teachers who would help schools and other stakeholders in training or education.
It is also counted with the organization of words with war veterans or people who were held hostage.
One of the possible options suggests that a new authority should be established, which should be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors point out that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state should use their capabilities until the threat status has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the progressive alignment of early visible borders between individual types of threats," states a reference to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
The officials noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on support for the largest number of capabilities, not just those of the military.
"The basic objective is to create a very broad framework, which enables every citizen to respond adequately to the situation of the threat of State or life, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, to contribute to the protection of others, and to prevent the failure to carry out tasks by the forces of the Czech Republic," the aim is stated.
The adoption of the law would result in small financial guarantees.
Their height will depend on the choice of options, according to the Ministry.
For example, the Authority proposes financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state to up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre was set up, its operation could be around 60 million kroner per year.
Other money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also suggests that the capacity of the national military authorities should be extended, which would jointly employ 42 other soldiers.
The representatives of the Ministry have already indicated that the law should also help to resolve the non-compliance of some Czech policies with the introduction of a Directive of the European Union relating to the maintenance of weapons.
He would have allowed the shooters who would be part of the system to leave some of the weapons prescribed by the directive.
Startupies that your companies will help you not to become another Uber.
Amy Errettov wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of his e-commerce at the start, but she did not find the appropriate research.
The answers were often vague, ineffective, or even complaining.
And although she made anonymity of the study, some employees expressed their lack of confidence in the whole process.
"I've been looking for consistency and objectivity," Errettov, owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, introduced with a seat in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help outside.
New start-ups from the field of human resources continue to appear on the market, helping companies to investigate the well-being of employees.
By creating and licensing software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' obligations, start-ups enable companies to make rapid voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer a simple anonymity of employees and a high line of complexity, and in some cases they also allow informers to include and contact the director directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that follow your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and general director of the Glint startup in Reedwood City.
Errettov pointed out that through Glint, she was able to learn more about what her employees think and feel within three years.
In addition to the rapid research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers the company's temperature map and a regular review of the groups with the highest level of activity, as well as the review of low-value managers - which allows users to work on the adjustment.
The companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to impose a duty on the culture of the working environment - if one of them becomes another Uber - which will disappear in the scandals after the former employee has published on his blog a contribution that describes the business environment and the burden of employees who tend to speak openly.
For startups such as Glint, the demand for research into corporate culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which is based on technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance by 2020 can exceed $118.8 billion.
Start Conference from Denver in Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, witnessed a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, firmly before Uber's scandal.
Some 600 clients are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently accepted Uber under his wing as well.
Like Glint, Converter allows the company to send appropriate "white" researches, collect reliable information in real time, and display hot maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the problems are sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has strengthened regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and executive director of the Konverten startup.
If the company is certified by unfair behaviour with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not delay - it may result in cost-effective results due to the client's fight, employee abuse or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday Restaurant Network, which employs over 25,000 people in almost 500 locations, uses Converter more than a year to increase employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure the easy way to contact corporate management.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check his phone number or e-mail on the management of the company, officially present the problem and trust in a positive solution.
Often there was a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general representative of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no common way to monitor the plight of employees.
Now, when the company uses Converter, it is ensured that there is a rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never been achieved before to managers, offices sitting in the office, on a distance away from the real solution of difficulties - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair behaviour.
"It is close to the Holistic, overall view of the experience of employees," Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday companies looking at risk management.
"At the same time, we protect the shareholders from court disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees on a light basis in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting company broke down after the fall of Enron’s company in the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But even when "you've seen social media all over the world," companies began to realize that online they can't simply hide their nightmares in the closet.
"Before people started using technology ethics to follow, they started to rely on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of services for which companies pay regular payments.
It is a business model and an opportunity that the prudent investors, who supported both start-ups, accept.
Konvertent chose as his own company's company's company campaign like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital totalling $10 million and eventually brought up his capital at $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessmer Venture Partners and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are a challenge that is surprising in view of the relationship between society, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research confirms clearly that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
And on the competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, are not the main benefits of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to consider that they are accepted and evaluated and that they owe their time to a company that has a positive message.
"If people are happy in their work, they think that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of society," said Nina McQueen, vice-president of global benefits and employee benefits of LinkedIn, who uses Convertent and Glint.
Investors learn when companies and companies thrive when their employees are at peace.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that will ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to society, it is not surprising that there will be a lot of investors supporting this effort.
It is important to provide data on employees' satisfaction, according to experts in working culture.
But the data alone are useless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The reality is that when a company asks for a return loan from its employees, it can make a big difference.
And if the change does not occur quickly - in the worst case - it may result in a deterioration and a lack of interest on the part of employees.
"When you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, head of the board at Kotter International, who was witnesses to many companies that were too closely related to the same date.
"Because when things don't go to the end, employees begin to question: ‘Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it interest me?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey between employees, is able to solve the problem by using Glint for one day, Errettov.
After a meeting of employees who were frustrated by slow decisions and quality of communication, Errettov was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start learning communication to solve the problem successfully.
Ruby Tuesday receives a very important view of its employees and hopes that from a long-term perspective, it will achieve a high level of employment in the area that I know is a great release.
"If you do not try to create a transparent working environment, employees will not trust you," Vitrano added.
"And when you start losing your employees, you'll come for customers.
And with the benefit of customers, the whole company is cut off."
Thursday became the last day.
On Thursday, with 38,3 degrees in the Watchtower magazine on Hodoninsk, it is the most recent day of the year in Czech.
He's been through such a strike that was originally the most recent day of the year from 37.3 degrees.
They've been informing the staff of the Czech hydrometric system.
Unlike yesterday on Thursday, there's not a lot of heat records.
The water was mostly polluted in Moravia, in Czechia was extremely cloudy.
A record of 35 of 145 metrologic stations measuring more than 30 years was completed on Tuesday.
On Thursday, the record was recorded only nine long-term measuring stations.
It may have been in The Watchtower that today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Poland today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum of four decades, and in Pohorelics in Brnik, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three decades.
Both records came in the same way as in the 2013 issue of The Watchtower.
High temperatures today appeared mainly on the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower, there was the largest crowd in the Dijákovicí in Znojsk and the ship over Dyjja in Břeclavsk, where the torrent was similarly extended to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not disappear.
In contrast, for example, in Western and North Western Czechs, according to the ČHMU website, today’s highest temperature is only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperature there began to grow until now afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current currency in Czech will be gradually detached according to CHMU and will be able to reach even more clearly on Sundays.
Most parts of Moravia, however, will remain high temperatures on Friday and on the south side of Moravia and on Saturday.
We've had this kind of trouble here.
The billionaires don't have the same voice in their voices as every full-time man in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as tough as Andrej Babish, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other water colleagues Martin Burdou and Antonín Fryče, sponsors Robeško Realist.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of insurance and business in real Paul Shehnal, who is also the president of his party.
The convicted corrupter and the king of the Czech hazard Ivo Valenta organized a private party.
Agrofert's political nest, as the project Andrej Babies did not want to name the Romanian elder Jaroslav Germany, is a capital for himself.
They recently caught their billionaires, too.
He's Dalibor uncle, owner of the Jablotron security plant.
According to his own words, he goes into politics in order to run well.
I mean, she's in an old-fashioned dress, but Uncle didn't say much.
"I've never set small goals," he said at the press conference.
This means that my goal is to hit the UN to get the old man's ass in the wars of twenty percent.
Leckdo was pushing.
The conversion of a grandpa is more significant.
billionaire Dalibor Uncle is a man of strong opinions.
Although she's willing to vote for the voice of the voters in the Oldest's dress, she continues to support Andrey Babies.
Uncle Babies also supported in previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a shot-out speaker and an uncontrollable rival of political hacks," he wrote prior to the 2013 elections.
Of course, he's not going to politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
You're gonna stay in my heart for me.
He's willing to get out of his control world and do something for us all.
Not long after her old man presented her as a new job, he returned from his surprise to Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Oldest to learn how to introduce himself to Babies.
Some can appreciate that Grandpa doesn't change his views and stand behind him regardless of what the dress he wears.
Others can speculate if you send Babies to the elderly to build your baby a man like that.
Further questions can be asked whether Chief Jablotron should have been involved with the Chief Agrofert in the business and not looking for another way to defend his commercial rival.
The first grandpa's public appearance, but not just around Babies.
Grandpa promised to send the elderly to campaign ten million crowns.
And if they need more money first, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop over a similar product.
Lastly recognized Gunner Zdeněk Bakala before the elections in 2010 spread millions on all sides.
The political division of security agencies Víta Barty, TOP 09 and citizens of democracy came together in this way to a total of thirty million.
It's just another time today.
The law prohibits any political party to give more than three million.
Now that Grandpa's in politics, at least he could learn the rules of the game.
Maybe you wouldn't have asked yourself a question why our policy has such a bad story.
Then, on his first day in politics, Uncle corroded the proposal for the tax relief of his family with the children who were studying.
People with high school education will come to us every month to a total of tens of thousands.
You're based on the 20th.
A man with tens of thousands is more rich than ever.
The one with the twenty poor.
In Grandpa's society's vision, the poor pay taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of running from the functioning of a social state where they do not share too much.
The rich will soon need help so that they don't lose their appetite.
The old ones can grab each other's hands with their new aquivises.
We're the rest of us, and thanks to Uncle, we can confirm that billionaires aren't good people.
Then there's another question to ask who to love.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who are members and members of their own country or nationals and nationals of the State shall not have their employees and their country of origin.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country, not just someone.
No one wanted Trump's heaven.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling property is not always easy.
And sometimes he doesn't even have 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that property sells president USA Donald Trump.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down for an incredible 8 million pounds.
He reported on the Mirror.co.uk website.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Stay away from the place like no other.
The fact that the real company was not linked to the US president did not make an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean silk with an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price was 13 million pounds.
And after the fall, the villa complex is about 76 medium-sized houses in the centre of Prague.
And it's not surprising.
The catchment seat of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 fully equipped bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, a lot of food, power and other rooms.
It's made up of several buildings.
The part of the land is also a pool and a tennis court.
There's a ten-pound fire on the ground.
From the terrace is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real experts, the fact that the association with the President is not sufficient to attract potential buyers was found at the price.
Now property is closer to the usual prices of property on the island.
Trump bought property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around 15 million pounds.
He had to buy property for the purpose of the search.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
It's a new price, but it's heading to second place.
The property in the neighborhood was estimated at 13.5 billion pounds.
The NCAA decided to end with two trains a day.
Nearly eleven afternoons and players of the UCLA UCLA's UCLA's football club are rocked in the back of the new school hall.
Some of them pull their clothes off and expose their marked background, a poor sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most members of these teams, a few minutes of disengagement takes place in the afternoon.
The recording players in the summer semester will go to the rooms after the three-year course to study at the final exams before returning to the Waterman Football Center at the meeting that takes place in the morning of 6:30.
"For these guys the next three days will be a regular cat," said coach Bruins Jim Mora shortly before he went over in the afternoon.
By setting up two coaches in one day NCAA wants to ease players - paradoxically the training days are even longer - at least then, when the final test ends.
That's why the first three UCLA trainees are planned at 19:15 - to get so busy with so many students' diaries already.
In fact, for the first six season that Mora spent in the position of a coach in Westwood, the training camp Bruns starts a week earlier than last year and trains are limited during the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainees from two to one day.
A total of eight trainers are scheduled to begin on 20 August, starting formal preparations for the first battle against the Texas A&M team that takes place in September.
He must be allowed to hear that he supports the NCAA decision, although there has been another position that has already been such an ordinary player's diary.
"For three or four days, the players are under great stress and it is very frustrating for them," said Mora.
"But no one has given it up. Everyone is trying. They're great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything's calm."
UCLA will be closed after the completion of the training campaign, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of surrounding areas from the nearby parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which equipped players after crossing the network for the branch.
Players Bruins would like to get tired this week, but Mora realizes that when the room goes out during the season, it could be a problem.
"The land will be monitored by the security service," added Mora.
"The security is stored, but it is not excluded that someone can find a room and play our coaches.
It's a good deal with that stuff.
The hotel will be happy to look after the security, just like the parking lot no. 8.
We're using our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything's going to work out.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans to check more closely the facts to limit the number of false reports
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third-party third-party and draw up the initial contributions in an effort to combat so-called "fake news", introduced the largest social network on Thursday.
In a statement on its websites, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible Hoaxes, which will send third parties to verify and possibly reflect the results of the study under original contributions.
Facebook has been designated as one of the main sources of false reports and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have affected the election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is all around. French voters are flooded with false reports of flower presidential elections, and Germany plans to launch an attack on the social media network, if soon the nuclear attacks will be eliminated.
On Thursday, in his next statement published in Germany, Facebook indicated that it is attempting to test new features of the control of false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the visualization of reports verified by third parties, people ask more content to be better informed and can decide correctly on what they can share," said Sara Su, a product manager on Facebook.
He added that Facebook continues to test the function of “subjective articles” and also works on other changes with a view to reducing the number of false reports.
Graphical news: story about A Castle in England
The little Scottish Castle hero recently played the main role in the music video clip of the Squeeze group and his attack also found Margaret Thatcher during the 70th and 80th centuries.
However, Scotty was one of his famous places in the Bewl River in the British Kent Witness for 700 years, inspired by the curator James Rhodes of the York City Museum - known historical background - to create graphic novels.
"The look at the letter of a man who is 300 years after death surprises me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I keep a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
Graphic novels A Castle and England document family life that lived in the city of Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not the first book of Rhodes inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"He invited me to print a letter that he wrote to the second agent in 70s who worked for Jacob," he said.
"It's the print of his fingers!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to burn a candle to read.
If I'm going to write it down, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support is from the National Trust and Arts Council England organization and the possibility of spending about four months in the city almost as much as a dream. ( "To tell the truth, I have to stay a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time studying the Victorian "new" town, studying the archives, and studying many treasures and curiots, such as the head of hyenas on the walls and the flames that were planted after the earthquake.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old city, talked to the hyenas, the gardeners, and at times also the artists who worked on the illustrations in his book.
In the night, he's been drinking whiskey and writing.
A reliable Scotney story is relatively unknown since the National Trust organization gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last cousin, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the employees began to go to the archives that Rhodes described as “the aristocracy of many centuries spread their hands with the words ‘Know this to the bottom’.”
Dentists, letters from the British Empire, maps of striking property: "You may think the dispute about land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I found a case when two families crossed the bridge.
Let the people go!"
Some stories in the book use the garden as a reflection museum and dream of deeper into English history, including the story called The Laborer, which follows the man who leaves the newly built garden to join the English rebellion in 1381.
"I found a record of opposition to the city from 1380, which was called in the book Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," said Rhodes.
"The English rebellion actually started in this area, and I thought that support was a good starting point.
Maybe it's something to do with the end."
Other stories are certainly familiar with the history of the city - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest who hid Darrell’s family after seven years during the English reform.
Or The Smuggler about the 18th century Passover, named Arthur Darrell, who reportedly calculated his own funeral when he filled out the rocks (which was discovered several years after the discovery of the cave).
Rhode’s beloved family are Darrell’s: “I was surrounded by men’s families — more men were always hired and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The various generations of Darrell's family have solved this by taking the rich or old ladies - I imagine they were the kind of ladies who were wearing their heads with their hair. "
With the end of the stay in the town of Peter Rhodes after other hospitality.
He recently returned from a two - day course in the Finnish diocese, where he found inspiration for his next book on Eljanmäki, an ancient sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was captured by nature.
It's a special place for Scottney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said, 'Now that I can go back to real life'."
Washington changes the conditions for making green cards
The media have published the words of President Donald Trumpa on a new American immigration plan, which will also change when the green card is awarded.
It is expected that the number of legal immigrants will be reduced by 50 000 over the course of the year due to the stricter rules for the provision of temporary working visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The legislative proposal will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases fraud, and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers. We intend to change the rules of granting green wages to citizens of other countries.
The law limits the number of passengers and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process is the primary English speakers, who represent financial resources and demonstrate the skills that will come from our country," said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual jobs are on the rise - we should be on the alert
Even if it seemed that the year 2017 could not be more critical, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual jobs are currently very popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and art intelligence at Sheffield University, and co-founder of FRR Noela Sharkey, it is necessary to take a serious look at the appearance of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eye, the shape of the beard and the appearance of the loss of the robot.
"People are interested in them, but sales are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them more often," added Sharkey on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual assistance changes from you to a robotic woman to a silica skin that is on the touch of pleasant heat - of course is an art of intelligence that resembles human behavior.
The user can "set" the robot to his face - from the color of his eyes and the shape of his nose to the color of his eyes and the color of his lips.
It is a very disturbing fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would attract the Stepford lady.
Modern smoking women grew up in a robotic woman with a silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set up his replacement women with different characteristics, between them and the flexibility.
And then here's a sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Company, which is supplied with the best-encompassed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a slow and wild Wendy with a "good-looking" behavior.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set up so that your personality can be expressed as much as possible," writes True Company's website.
So he likes what you like and instead.
He's even loaded, just like people.
It may be tired, chatting or "in the back."
The rise of sexual robots is alarmingly alarming for several reasons - between the lack of exchange for real mesilid relationships. The more disturbing are the more vulnerable female characters and violent threats - e.g. frigid (reading) Farrah.
The True Company on its websites compares Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If he could have a wife vibrator, why couldn't he have a husband Roxxxy?" it says on the page.
Sexual robots, however, are not just fetish or sexual help.
Their appearance and almost perfect sophistication indicate something darker and deep in our culture - from the ideal or sexual equality to the direction of sexual intercourse with a voluntary character.
Most men do not buy a man's robotic woman, and while the FRR speaks of their growing love, sexual workers remain on the edge of the interest of the public.
This genuine interest, however, can be a reflection of the modern time set up.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they've lost a free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophistication of sexual workers appear at a time when women around the world are enjoying their rights and in the White House is a president who is often very lenient at the woman's address.
The most frightening aspect of the series of events is not what we see - the body and the eyes are excited, as the reality of these visions is more real.
The book’s presentation of the history of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but at the same time it seems to be a small step.
Sexual services are available as much as possible to real women as possible (maybe with a measure of pornography).
Their faces are designed to be pleasing to the touch and motivated to the first view as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would undermine their independence or undermine their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're nice kids.
He says the 21st century: ministerial.
The NBA star on the green watch.
Curry's coloring in California about milk.
The star basketballist Stephen Curry did not lose in spite of the first incident packed at the start of the premier between professional golfers.
Double rating holder for the most profitable NBA player played on the tournament Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round on 74 rans and will fight for cuts.
The Golden State player, who received a second title in the NBA team in this season, began very nervously and his first vacation ended in a hold on a golf course packed in the fair.
Even after the net, he wasn't as accurate as under the basketball suit as he was, but he left ten professionals with a four-year-old balance sheet over a couple.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, it had to call the decision-makers right after the first time, but then it was a little sedated," Curry said with the fact that a huge tree fell on him.
It was very nervous, to blow the first morning on the tour, but it was all I had hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first wheel, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Currym is able to fight with a knife that will most likely be set at two hours a couple, he will become the first representative of another sport that will be achieved on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I'm free of the trees, it's probably going to go," said the so-called golfer, who in the past played on tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
In Hayward, he starts first on a tour that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsorship and maintained an amateur status.
The series Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trompo's big victory?
On the contrary, Mitt Romney is a healthy mind.
A poor symbol of the Trompo era is becoming political divisions that divide the American volleyballs and also disrupt the entire family in a micro scale.
In the period of Vánoc and Díkuvzdén, it was done in American newspapers by the councils, how to deal with the neighbours who love Trumpa.
I mean, we're just waiting for the nerves to let us go.
However, less attention has been paid to the family’s Trump’s ability to build.
I'm talking about the fact that this week she visited me in New York my sister-in-law - a witch and a boy who lives in Chicago who paid for a long time in our family for a Republican mistake.
She reminded me that hypocrisy in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, he is the whole family - including all the republican sourizens who have been interested in politics for a long time - on one floor.
It's a good thing at dinner at the family table, but it makes me realize that in a broader context it represents a significant risk.
The trumpet is pushing the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has a great impact on all of us transport.
If we talk about "normalize" and Trump, we point to a frightening possibility that his hats can lose one day on attractiveness.
There is, however, a more horrendous long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the French Republic, who, in accordance with its standards, will be surprised by what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitta Romney and his version of the crazy conversation - dog on the highway, 14% of the taxes from the reception (at least we had knowledge of his tax recognition) - both of which appear to be very peaceful comparisons with Trump.
After the Trip has left, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an inconsistency improvement.
We used the visits of my sister and took the children to Central Park on the largest hill that runs the New York Parks Department - you will find no better use for your three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle war is covering the slamminates - the clowns and the animals hang on and in the hills look on their own shoulder - the whole landscape view and the cinca music of the shopping cart reminds of public transport.
Many cynics quickly cross the river: a look at the high buildings, the panorama is watching, instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your imaginations.
About five years later, I have not been moved by the fact that Swiss Cottage is not in fact Swiss cheese - not counting the theme of Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the station in London.
However, the bicycle in Central Park is a highly magical experience, and this is to the point that two-year-olds, just like two-year-olds, are playing a great game on it.
If I could count the column, I'd earn the maximum number of points, but no one's asking for luck.
I had a similar experience this week when I was asked to assess my "sustainance" at a level from one to five when I was paying a credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same with the difference that I can come up with 15% worth for something I'm buying for a bowl.
Not only does it slow down another fast sale, but the server is forced to turn to the purchaser's office if it is not necessary.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I underestimated my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest disease
This is already the area where Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
The last year has been healed because of a number of injuries to safety, which, according to the release of the prison itself, has been caused by a fall in the target.
The Pistorius was convicted of murder after calling against the original trial for murder.
He killed his friend Steinkampo in the early morning hours at Valentín in 2013 with several shots across the door of the toilet in his home in Pretoria.
The Pistorius claimed he was online stealing her.
The complainants announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which is too peaceful according to their words.
National Procedural Authority has indicated that she has appealed to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the trial is still under way this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with prolongation of the sentence up to 15 years.
In the Republic of South Africa there is no death penalty.
For the first time in history, a young man was born in an adorable panda, which was planted in the wild.
It's a great success for the Pand rescue program.
The Centre is also trying to expand the genofound of the gangs held in custody.
Čang Č-chung told the agency of New China that the walk of the panda poses a great risk to flying from the neighboring crossing.
Only 471 pounds at the end of last year's life.
There are only two thousand of them living in the open.
The effort to keep the pants tied up with these wild ones is so first step towards helping to protect this kind of panda.
The Cchao-cchao patent was released to the natural reserve at the beginning of the summer period of 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on the church, scientists could observe every step of it.
She met her famous Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The sex relationship with the panda himself lasted for a minute and a half and he got successful.
And this can be seen as a small sight, because the birds themselves are not a consideration for the most successful millions of animals.
The monkeys are quite wrong when they're ready, and they're often confused and uncertain about what to do.
Young people were born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an abnormal appetite during pregnancy, it was counted 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newly born pandy is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
The tourist group, including two Bulgarians, was held on 1st August in the early hours of the siton police.
All were released for a few more days, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out to BTV that Bulgarian tourists were released later.
The Greek authorities have ratified the rules of free camping and have imposed strict sanctions on anyone who is admitted to a place where the camping is not permitted.
Controls will take over the whole season.
The Ministry indicated that the court could impose a fine.

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands produce millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 refugees.
According to the Reuters agency, the Dutch Food Safety Authority reported that it surveys 20 per cent of all Dutch farmers, which means that 80 per cent of eggs on the market are not required.
The Authority pointed out that the risk represents only a limited number of species known according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the number of toxic substances in small eggs and for adults does not represent a risk, but the potential risk is for children.
The Czech SVS Petr Major reported that the eggs and pigs from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined in the closure of the cows, did not come to the Czech Republic in recent years.
However, veterinary samples of eggs and meat from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland will be collected, where problems of insecticide have been identified.
Vegetables from Belgium were based on veterinary management in the Czech market for the last time in the autumn and the Netherlands for the last in May.
The fresh meat from Belgium last appeared in Czech in June.
In Czech, however, there is a certain quantity of chicken meat from the Netherlands.

Riga is beautiful, I'm going to miss her, she's saying a gold sedlaček and she's looking for a deal.
I'd like to have ten more years.
"I need to go back there once," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the bad taste.
It depends on whether he gets an appointment at the start of the new anniversary.
What were the four years that you lived in Latvia?
If I should value it like in school, like three.
I didn't think much of the first year, I had an experienced gentleman before me.
I learned.
The second year, I started to catch it.
A third season ago, I thought they were giving me more space.
But they brought a new gentleman with whom I had a fight again.
Loney, I was hoping I'd still get it.
But during the initial ten games, we got almost five points, so the coachers started to beat it.
After all, he's got more of my colleague.
But that's what he's doing.
They wanted to play him next season.
What was life like in Rise?
That's amazing.
It's a little Praha.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss it.
I found a friend there.
We're together for the third year, next year we'll be married.
So I brought something.
How's KHL for the bankers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Sloven who have to change their hierarchical style against him.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to pay for it.
It means playing more back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the corner.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
Less shoots, and even though they have a temporary branch, they'd rather play.
In Czech, they only shoot more.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving over seven hours?
If a man doesn't have a family, it's not a problem.
It can take a rest.
The program is usually done so you need to play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lotsies actually hire their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole Lotsies are watching hockey, together with basketball is a national sport.
Fuck you all.
Even though it didn't happen, a lot of people walked.
Did Dinam's move in KHL help to ensure that Lotisski, on the annual mission of the world, had little to do with the quarter-finals?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results began to rise above the darkness of the world.
On the 2014 Olympics in Soci, the fourth finals with Canada fell at 1:2.
That was an unrealistic result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
There's still more flying players going to the Czech extraglige.
In Zlyno, Roberts Bukarts passed, and before the contract was signed, Ralfs Freibergs.
How come they're going here so much?
They're not any chicken players, they're really good.
More teams are looking for younger and younger players from abroad, Lottish among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL is starting in three weeks.
Why are you still out of business?
I knew I wouldn't move on in Riz.
That afternoon we started looking for something.
There was a Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have to count on the generals, we didn't agree.
Then it was classic.
We were dealing with different teams, but eventually they decided for someone else.
So I'm going to walk home in Green, and I'm gonna wait for something to happen.
Aren't you nervous?
I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I've been home for a while.
I took something off in KHL, so I'm taking it different.
The question is, when and where to sign.
How real is the option that you're gonna split up in Green?
It can happen anything.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month, where what's going to happen.
Now I can just wait for the agent to speak.
Do you prefer any competition?
The turbulent season wasn't so I could choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government flight in Latvia is on its way.
In January of the year, in article S of the care of the proper manager, did I also write about the camp in the Flights in Orlik?
The subject matter remains the same, and I will allow the weighting of the article to be remembered.
He's been talking about a camp in Letech for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it'll probably be the best when they look at the official pages of cultural memory Piet's place of summer.
The historical review reveals that the camp became two kilometers east of the city of Latvia, that from 8.8.40 he served as a working camp, from 1.1942 he became a collective camp and from 2.8.1942 he became a Chicago camp.
In the next text, the life course is described in the camp, including the Dutch conditions, until March 1943, when the first year of prison was registered for global transport.
On 4. 5. 1943, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the air-conditioning camp.
All of them were 420.
A very sad story of the relentless attacks of human beings, which have caused them once again human beings and advanced ideologies.
There is no argument that it is necessary to keep those events in mind.
There is no argument that this reminder should be reflected in the memory instead of the past suffering of these people.
The problem's different.
For socialism, Jaxi was a little remembered, and in the 20th century, it was close to the site of the former camp.
The history of the camp was well published in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, a memorial was published in Latvia in 1995.
In the second half of the 20th century, the government made a promise to recover and rebuild the site, but it has not done so.
In 1998, the Memorial was announced to the cultural memory and has been under the auspices of the Lidice Memorial since 2009.
In June 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close in the evening.
That's so special facts about the arbitrary court of the camp.
As soon as the government took over, the government approved the repurchasing of the site and decided to draw up a search warrant to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will buy back on Friday.
According to the Minister of Culture of Hermana, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably miss those goals if I went to public with them."
We'll see what the professional trial brings.
According to some informal estimates, it can take hundreds of millions, others say the price can reach up to a billion.
It's like it's not going to be cheap in any case.
In addition, only a few hundred metres from the former camp stand as a memorial to which the state invested about ten million kroner in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction had been financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is obviously not dangerous, it would be the same as I think it would be a waste of money.
What does the government have no other priorities?
A memorial, a worthy afternoon, is in a practical position in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wishes can be remembered here by the torturers and the victims.
I don't see any reason why it changes!
Let's do it the way it is, and let's keep the fifth place with the maximum gravity.
The entrusted property, and the money of the taxpayers, should, in this case, be treated by the Government of the Czech Republic with the care of the proper economy.
At least with the same thing as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the head of government is not the whole government.
However, I consider the above facts to be the word of the ANO leader only as an empty pre-trial declaration.
This year in May, I started looking right at the place.
Very well-sustained road, furnished parking lot, replications of wooden camp bars.
In one exhibition, in another integrated WC with current water.
A small natural amphitheater with a seating option and with a view to its own southern location, which is made of stones placed in a peaceful mood.
A lot of flowers and weddings.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as it sounds and belongs.
At the present time, he is at the place of the original archeological research team.
It would be reasonable to consider, for example, whether it would be possible to preserve a portion of the open funds and at least in a visual manner.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could push his efforts.
In the event that he is able to afford a public money-back site in the government, this will only be a further unfortunate step in his own way in a rather problematic way in the role of the Minister of Culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may moderate symptoms of infectious disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, it can be red meat and milk products at night’s size.
However, the new study points to the true opposite: the richness of animal protein and milk products could help relieve symptoms of infectious cancer.
An incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. citizens and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, causes chest and blood clots, loss of weight and extreme anxiety.
Patients are usually reminded not to consume meat and milk products to reduce their symptoms. However, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acid triptofane contained in protein helps to create immune cells that support the release of salt.
The leading study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells protect the lungs and ensure the removal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of infected cells is estimated to be a number of cells that support tolerance and protection of the body, without causing damage to the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the mixture of your injections on the site of the infection, it may lead to an infectious disease of the brain.
Scientists have found the presence of immune cells that support body tolerances in the stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria require the creation of a bunk of triptophane - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between another bacteria - Lactobacillus reuter - which is a common part of the cancer microbimus and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerances.
The more the tryptophans had muscles in their chests, the more they had these immune cells."
He also suggested that if it is shown that it is also paid for a person, then the combination of L. reuters and the rich on tryptofan would help develop a more aggressive and less competitive environment.
Postgraduate research by Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of certain types of immune cells supporting body tolerance, revealed that one group of testing mice had these cells, while another group of the same human brain cells had the same function.
The result is that one group of muscles has different cancers - a community of bacteria, viruses and fluids that usually survive in the gastrointestinal tract.
The brains were tested by the method of DNA collection and researchers found six types of bacteria in the muscle with immune cells that were administered by the second group of muscles.
The muscle that was held in the sterilized environment and missed them with the cancer microbes - then this type of immune cells - was given to L. reuter bacteria - and the immune cells were created.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuters in liquid and then transmitted a small amount of fluids - without bacteria - to the immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells evolved into tolerance cells.
After the removal of the active substance from the fluid, it was shown that the product of triptofan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octane acid was considered.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptofane in the dry muscle, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. After the dose of triptofan was split, half of the cells were counted.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as the muscles and most of us keep the L. reuters in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether subsequent products of triptofan from L. reuters cause human bile development in the same way as in the muscle, but genetic defects related to triptofan have been detected in humans with an interest in cancer.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should most certainly be strong about the development of these cells because they control the activity of the internal surface.
Potentially high levels of triptophane in the presence of L. reuter bacteria may increase the population of the bunker."
José Mourinho considers the signature of the contract with Nemanj Mattic and his transition to Manchester United for 'general'
Manchester United got to his team "genia" like Nemanja Matić - at least this is what José Mourin's idea is after what the depositary started in the middle of the conspiracy against Sampdori.
Matić, who signed the contract for 40 million pounds, entered the first battle at 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-session round in front of UEFA Supersupport, where the United met in the afternoon with Real Madrid - and acted in his role as a deputy next to Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-session Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, according to Mourinha's word, it was necessary to work before the start of the next Premier League season.
"It takes time, but it's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant thought - thinking football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him get to the condition first."
Like Mattić, and his new players Victor Lindelöf and Romel Luka also played the first game at the Aviva Stadium and Mourin's starting to form their unit for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourin wants to continue to sign the contract with three other players, but he insists that the club took the "fantastic work" and brought three of the four most important players into the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"four of the four would be more pleased with me, but I recognize that they have made a maximum for me."
The life challenge of the King of the Creeds of Ládi Hrušky.
He wants to learn from Pohlreich!
This multifaceted picture began to grow through the new series on TV Prima Zdenňk's Academy.
Oh, my God. The noise just blew up the chance.
"My Lord, I would like to join your fire academy because, with my heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on the social network.
And because these two years have gone by, he hasn't forgotten Ladja's defeat this time.
"On the payroll I can teach you the sleepy from the diet of cooking meat, the American cakes or invite you to water and show you why it's a cute cheese," Hruška said.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to look at the level of height and learn from the mystery.
"The question is what the boss is about," said Blasko.
But the majority didn't show up because he picked up new parts of his next order, yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to Croatia's participation in the culinary Academy with the fact that he took the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes outside of television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich set up his first cook in the morning.
In a few days, she was sold over 300 thousand pieces!
The new order that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference to the underground broadcast scheme is an unfavourable fire school.
Pohlreich picks up his tears from a series of wildflowers, and in the 12th parts he is familiar with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show, now the chief fires in November 2014 the Zdeněk on the back of his trick has allowed him to shake a broken hole.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"It's just a smile - the rose is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladja replied.
He's thinking about Ladje's culinary art.
"Watching according to Ládi Hrušky does not come into the mind or home, because I will not leave the house with a gastropunk," said the chief.
I love Pohlreich's teeth very much, even if he says I'm making chicken in the middle.
In my order, however, his recipes will certainly not appear," he did not leave Croatia.
It's fat!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV club.
"Gastronomic analfabe or debilitate," said Pohlreich about Croatia to one speaker.
"I don't have twenty to be able to raise my hand over them, but I don't solve them anymore," he pointed to an account of the cut-offs of Croatia.
The British explorer uses the microchip in his hand to take off the car and the house
The British explorer became the first man in the country with a microchip attached to the body. With a simple hand, he can open the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Three-year-old Steven Northam left a small chip to implant between the palace and the indicator and at the same time offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify life by using technology.
In the process of implanting and maintaining medical procedures, Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips in implanted dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers the service of exchange of doors and cars, compatible with microchip. The price of one lock is 300 £.
A woman's father of one child allowed technology to integrate into his home and his car the BMW Z4 symbol, which starts with a simple soft hand.
White House requisitated thousands of dollars of taxpayers
The White House's decision to fly with the maritime helicopter to South Lawn for the occasion of the celebration of the American manufacturing industry that took place last month came at $24,000 according to the maritime records issued by the TIME week.
Green White helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the President on the deck, was the top of the program on 17 June in the White House, which was the review of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several high officials of the White House looked at products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was stationed next to the yachts from Maine, a bus from Wisconsin and a busy train from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of helicopters within 36 hours prior to the arrival of helicopters in South Lawn in the context of the “immortal” event, the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the management of helicopters.
"I wanted to make sure that you had such an important event," HMX-1 wrote in his e-mail to his commanding officer, the representatives of the seamaster for the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter reached South Lawn on 17 July about 7:00 on the occasion of a review, whose start is planned at 15:00 and will remain in place until the total crossing of the place that was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail further stated that if it comes to the late departure from the White House, a refund will be sent for the return year due to the working time regulation.
The original crew stayed this evening with the helicopter and also with them a safety unit.
Of the records - which received the TIME week - it was not clear whether the second post was finally sent.
Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was the Hatch Act breach and we were sure it's all right," the director wrote.
"It sounds like you're blocked," the representative of the president said.
This review "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President made a medical reform that went through the Senate and spoke about efforts to keep the government regulation back.
The use of air transport means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is a challenge for a new phenomenon.
The presidents are using them on their way.
However, their presence is unusual for the reasons presented.
Trump ordered control in the area after the presidential plane had landed in the background at his first assembly in the Malbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account was charged with the difficulties of using the presidential plane of his predecessor.
"The White House is pleased with the review of ‘Made in America’, which has represented products from all 50 countries that produce American material," introduced the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train arrivals in Washington and South Lawn and increase the opportunities with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump, at the beginning of July in Germany, attended the G-20 summit, HMX-1 held 58 concerts in the White House.
The flight to visit Made and America was part of the current training team, introduced a state worker.
On the same day, the helicopter unit landed within the "non-presidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House indicated that no other revisions were made of the money of the taxpayers.
Sikorsky's speaker pointed out that the company was not interested in any way in the South Lawn helicopter exhibitions.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential year and the exact costs of the review are difficult to determine, according to the statement of seafarers.
According to the Ministry of Defence, an hour's price is made for the fiscal year 2017, DoD's expenses for VH-3D $24,380 per hour.
The units record time is 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters move significantly below the given proportion.
"Settling the costs of taxpayers on the basis of expenditure remuneration is very impressive," Walters said throughout his business.
"These fees include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the cost of DoD costs does not include staff costs, but includes the cost of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The next press secretary of the White House Sean Spicer refused to use helicopters for inspection purposes.
"The idea of watching this week is to represent products made in the United States," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defence of our state, and that they are giving jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, just like most Americans, we're on a helicopter and other military equipment that divides the U.S. population.
This fact should be remembered."
It's not clear whether Trump was also on his way to South Lawn on the helicopter. It can only be said that he was seated as a volunteer of one of the Fascist vehicles.
Back in White House Trump spoke to the representatives of Sikersky and tweeted with media about his own fleet of products.
"Sikorsky I know very well," said the president, "I have three own now."
A young woman entered the pool at the Mácho lake, and the police were on board.
The girl went out to the beach on Sunday morning in the morning about two hours early.
But instead of buying, she remained stuck in the mud.
When she decided to call the police on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," reported police spokesman Ivan Balák.
There were several police guards at the place she was about to sign, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police had to sail hundreds of feet of rock before they felt a strong ground again," Balákja said.
And the same thing was wrong.
The police focused on the direction from which her call for help came.
"To avoid at least this connection, they agreed with her that it would be a complaint to rest," said the speaker.
Police women found up to three fourths of five in a church in Borní.
She was on the ground of physical and psychological forces and received the sign of submission.
That's why a called sanitist transferred her to a cescolipic hospital.
A connection with Uncle Stan?
From no news, she's becoming a saleswoman.
It's a little irony.
In his web project search.cz, as a billion voters would basically say that the STAN is suffering from the deficit of the deaf people.
And he also argued that political parties do not generate more famous and independent parties than they do, in fact, have no national programme for recording elections.
Her willing candidate will only become a listening person after talking to Grandpa to have any political opinion.
He started out this way, too, and it didn't happen very well.
In his honour to the obedient people and the characters who, if any, are rewarded by the candidates, some of the elderly, which has also allowed the Gazdik, more than Grandpa is also breaking up and the favorite argument of the head of the STAN, that the greatest value is the political examination and experience of the elderly, traditionally the most popular policies and according to studies.
Now, they're slowly building up newly acquired unknown personalities.
The total divorce with the people who changed the logo and the logo after the Stan explained that the gang doesn't want to lose its identity on the candidates.
But if the STAN of identity suspected only a small one, after the Grandfather's coming, he's only playing the identity.
Not only did the Gazdík have long spoken against the UN Andrej Babies, but at the first joint press, Grandpa, who is publicly praised by Babies, said: "My goal is to win the ANO and then win the olds in the coming elections by twenty percent."
Let's hope he didn't break his nose.
Grandpa's a successful businessman and a billionaire is definitely not an accident.
He often speaks of politics like Babies, but he does not have his own political mark.
TAN has been remembering the reality of the show for some time more than the real political party and the help hand of Grandpa than she would ever do to a selling girl from any news.
In time, Stan went with TOP 09, then with people, and now he's looking for people who are listening to change.
Let's hope someone's calling.
Police dogs had fun in the bridge with a wheelchair
Dogs specializing in search of explosives and lost dogs today spent most of the winter on the lake.
The police dog should not be baseless and have fear of flying, said the police cynoologists of the Austrian country of Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training lasts two years.
At the bridge, the more the dog training gets, the more people go through it.
According to the standard training that was to be carried out around the lake by heavy fuel samples and to search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to climb to the vertigo and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in the wheelchair.
So that right now, what a swirl can do, the dog could go to work so he wouldn't have a problem with a swirl.
"Exactly hunter, dog goes and immediately seeks," Tomášek pointed out.
A dog that is uncomfortable or is not able to start working right now is out of school.
"Most of them then leave them on the garden, for example," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in Austria.
They control German sheep, but they also belong to Belgian sheep.
He's got a dog shit about him.
"He's doing it on his own, preparing it for a service that will make a dog for us," Tomášek added.
The animals undergo repeated veterinary tests that may reveal any health Hendickep.
If the dog is healthy and healthy, it will be the first test in 20 months.
"Tomášek added, "Tomášek is about two and a half years old to the sharp stock."
The length of the police service depends on the health status of the dog.
Most of them serve eight to ten years.
Then most of them live in their dogs.
Trailer in the 3rd season of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is outside the game and Cali Cartel becomes the center of the Netflixu series
Despite the closing of the second season of Narcos, when Pabla Escobar was murdered, the Netflixu series will not be over.
The approval by the streaming service was already expected by the third and fourth season - firstly named by the first trailer and the invention of other obstacles.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential motorists, they operate “as a company from Fortune 500,” only with the distinction of increasing violent acts and increasing the number of government actors.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is a leading cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis) plays the brain of surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) has an old connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) in New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal is returned as Javier Peña, becoming an American and Colombian rights defender in the fight against drugs.
Among the other priests are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be re-examined by its Prime Minister on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy is closely related to women in politics
Volunteers can only be reliable if all members of the company, including women, have taken part in the middle of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that the participation rate of women in local representatives is three women, and more than 30 percent of the new registered voters are women.
"The role of a woman cannot be seen," he pointed out in his mid-term statement.
Volunteers can be fully representative and reliable only if they are involved with women, as well as all relevant processes that relate to elections.
The city and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has published several attacks on the voluntary process, which have moved international war on the other side.
In the annual elections, it is the first time that one democratically elected government is giving its power quietly to the next government.
Haysom pointed out that a strong role of women is to strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Voluntary Commission indicated that of the 3.6 million registered volunteers, 1.2 million women were created.
A unique beer is burning beer again.
Good beer to the re-enacted beer.
The excitement and admiration of new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a beer farmer in Lobči in Mšena.
Pivovar, the first mentioned in 1586, has a renaissance core and was stopped in the 19th century.
She's been following the summer vacation when the beer was mostly covered with dark beer.
During the second world war, the production was banned and the beer was born in 1984.
Since then, they've served the building for a state ship.
Some of the stories were made by the owners of the beer in 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and distributed on construction materials.
In 2007, however, she saw a new hope in the form of new owners, architects, Jan and Paul Prouzov.
They started to fix the buildings with the highest respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have dedicated their lives to studying archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building materials.
The beer has the same looks as in the 19th century when it started its golden era.
Their work was assessed by the declaration of a beer for the cultural memory of the Ministry of Culture and the building became part of the European industrial heritage.
In 2015 the tradition of beer burning was celebrated.
If you would like to enjoy a great lobby beer in the small region of Kokoreńska, visit the ski resort in the area of the beer.
When the beer is burning here, they use Korean water that flows into protected rural areas, salts from the labyrinths and the petals.
You enjoy a traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't take a look at the beer, go on Saturday and Sunday in the afternoon and on the second.
Československa?
One of the greatest strengths of your type on a global scale?
This unique building was supposed to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Zaclère, on the top of the tertiary grave above the village of Baba.
It was originally to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected with a vast landscape.
There should be leadership, cassary, ammunition, materials, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
But the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
Within a few years, he was able to set up the only possible railway bunker and were removed from underground areas.
Thanks to the surprises from Spolk Stachelberg, who began rebuilding the unique building in the early 1990s, you can see here too.
The land is already available in 75 percent!
The area is also part of the T-S 73 ski resort with exposed and ground and equipped with a light refurbishment object, two more scattered ski resorts, shelters and scientific trails Refurbished Trutnovsk.
The area, the valley floor and the beautiful views of the country are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building came to the list next to such monuments as the Grand Chinese Wall, Traian port in Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrudu.
Klášter Chotéšov originally created a four-fold building of the Convention above the beautiful garden of the 13th century.
The list that came to you, but unfortunately it belongs to the unique building that threatens the loan.

Meet the plant with one click.
Students with herbarians and ordinary lovers growlin will help new free PL@ntNet applications.
If they are interested in what plants they have just grown on the passerby, these applications will advise them.
The only thing they're gonna do is take a picture of the plant and the application itself knows what kind it's about.
The new application available for iOS and Android was presented in the afternoon by representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education of the CEEV in the Bratislav Park in the framework of the Project of the City of Secret Life.
The project included 50 Czech and Slovenian schools, which photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database with teachers.
The new emerging French app is free to download on the websites of the City's Secret Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make the most people contribute to the application of their pictures and thereby increase the number of plants that can be identified.
"Children who hold the tablet or cell phone in their hands can jump into the forest," said the coordinator of this project Ivana Poláčková.
On the basis of sufficiently high quality photos of flowers, leaves or fruit plants, the application can be identified within a few seconds, which is then listed in the Czech and Slovenian photos.
The French allowed us to translate into Slovenian and Czech applications into the city's sacred life project.
It is therefore welcome for users to add an image of plants that are not yet available in the database.
"Francouz will assess whether it is useful and then add it to the database," Poland reported.
GMB information about investments in McVitie's company in Glasgov
The committees require assurance from the manufacturer's manufacturer of McVitie's long-term obligation to produce in a factory in Glasgov.
The Scottish board of directors of the GMB stated that the company is currently milking any investment into the Tollcross company.
In the company he works more than 500 employees who manufacture other than Hobnob and Rich Tea stores.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis company, indicated that over the past few years, more than 5 million people have invested in the whole area.
He added that the staff and representatives of the committees would be “between the first informed” in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the founding company, the Scottish GMB expressed its concern that McVitie's "will not be able to obtain its promises on the financing and modernization of manufacturing lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Many families and employees have worked here from the local community and the area of Glasgov, where work is often a critical pillar of hard work in the area of high unemployment and social decision-making.
From the point of view of work, wages and prosperity - and despite the view of Brexit, the cost of living and the resulting small product - the eastern part of Glasgow needs the hope of a prosperous manufacturer, whose name is McVitie's."
Pladis’s speaking company said: “The residents of Tollcross received a letter from the GMB yesterday and the company publishes the first statement as we appreciate the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the committees.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and the meeting was open to many problems.
We talked to the employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and insecure economic conditions, we appreciate our work on a regular basis, which pays for all our activities so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
He added: “In recent years we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in manufacturing and operating lines.
We highly appreciate the legacy of Tollcross and higher localities and, in the case of any changes in the operation, the employees and representatives of the committees will be informed without delay."
She warned PSG Barcelona to move Neymara three years ago?
La Liga will be able to show her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-German does not allow his efforts to get Neymara on his side after he made 189 million dollars, so the amount needed to buy Neymara out of the contract, but did he warn this French team of Barcelona about its record-keeping already three years ago?
This sedentary transition has expanded the waters of summer crossings. Club League 1 is ready to cross over more than twice the previous record amount for Paula Pogby's transition to Manchester United, which paid 89 million dollars for him in the London season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and at the same time the world's fairest professional athletes - after the release from the PSG team will be picked up over 500 000 £ a week.
Barcelona is upset by the way Neymar concluded his contract, despite the fact that he has confirmed that the club has always tried to keep Neymar from his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this fact three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matudiho in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif defended all the clubs that would be interested in re-examined one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll certainly say one of their players," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences."
It seems that Barcelona crossed the mental limit when she expressed interest in the PSG representative Marc Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that, in no circumstances, it does not allow the departure of the Italian representative. So it is possible that Barcelona, for her trophal meeting now, now with the departure of Neymara, has a hot pill.
Who's gonna explain the penalty?
Does political punishment have a broad understanding of the rules?
Donald Trump's key to the anti-terrorist sanctions.
Earlier, the United States had handed down sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the day before, Trump wrote that China's not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it's not going to be that way.
And from that, the purer thought of the penalty as a slamm of bot.
Those things can't get into one pie.
Madur's Venezuela really showed up on the road to the dictator, for totality.
China just doesn't behave like the president of the United States.
Russia's capital for itself.
But if anyone wanted to hide it so that even the ordinary volition, American, European or other, understood what it is and what the system of rules is about, it would be almost impossible for that to happen.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely asking what President Obama has already found, but he has given it a ruling.
So why such a divorce?
Loni feared that if he won the American volition Trump, we would fight Putin and take the penalty.
That's a terrible idea.
But in practice, it's weird.
With Trump, the sanctions don't release, but they're speeding up.
Only Europe is more afraid.
German Prime Minister Zypris says the troops are violating international law.
It's like the hunter's only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no EU anti-terrorist sanctions.
The Head of the European Commission, Juncker, again complains that the Trump sanctions threaten EU energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use the guns just so they don't harm anyone?
A regular fan of tapes.
For three years, it has been heard that the anti-virus sanctions will depend only on the fulfilment of the minority agreements on Ukraine.
It is now found that it is about EU energy security.
The love of the tapes and the wider.
In Russia, sanctions are coming because it's too mounted where it doesn't have.
China's too tired to mount a little.
The Venezuelan president is punished for building a dictatorship in his country's borders.
All these tortures or just comments have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babish: I don't think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossed the Republic with his vision book and finalized a voluntary program.
Besides the Pardubic country, he's already got all his candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not pay them a lot of attention.
He even agreed to lead the U.N. Ivo Vondrák school in Morravskoslsk.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a messenger or a Heytman," confirmed his previous position, Babiš.
A number of representatives and national policies have been angered by the fact that the elderly and the Prime Ministers should direct the cities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious about that?
It wasn't like that.
I am a representative of direct democracy, we call the President directly, and I am convinced that we should also vote in favour of the elderly and the prime minister.
In my book, I'm not talking about the destruction of the agents. They can be there quietly.
It's a question of how many of them will be.
At the presentation of your book on what I'm thinking when I sleep, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about breaking up the opposition.
You don't remember that.
I was talking about the direct choice and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the receiver is calculated to have a little bit of standing up and not making big projects, but she has no competence for that.
It also pays for the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I don't say they did well.
The current prime minister, but he doesn't control anything, he's just fashioning the debate.
It can't work that way.
That's why you want to cross the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's going to be hard.
In the program, we only have a change in the single-collar election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a clumsy mandate of the Ministers and the adjustment of the Rules of Procedure to prevent the rest of the exhibitors, who should work mainly in the committees and in the committees, from attending summer meetings.
Certainly it is not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator, you will rule the government, control the film with 101 Members, destroy the country and the Senate, and rule the whole country through grateful elders and beneficiaries.
It's definitely not.
However, there is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron announced a reduction of the legal assembly on the third, where there are 57 thousand French lawmakers, while we have 17 thousand Czechs.
Macrona still doesn't blame anyone for the threat of democracy.
Even if someone has won a majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that will prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The evidence for those who have a majority of parliaments is, however, big enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that is dangerous in the case of an UN famine.
We just need a team that will work for people, not for our parties or resorts.
I don't need to understand why we couldn't agree that there's only a higher salary for teachers, employees in culture and social services.
Why were I voted over and added 21 percent to the GIBS officials, who are now taking 60 thousand?
Would you like to get into this as a prime minister?
The Prime Minister is pleased when ministers behave in an uneconomic manner, take advantage of the government with the travel office and, for the money of the state, like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers don't have to argue in the government, they have to make a statement out of it.
The cabinet has to go to the ready material, where there is no place for coalition, loud voices, and hats, where it has to be decided.
How do you want to have a team of associates when ministers behave mainly side-by-side?
There's a constitutional law on the sides.
When it came to breadmaking, Sobotka said that the coalic contract is not paying, and he expelled Babies from the government.
This can be done by any prime minister.
But if it is personality and has the ability to control it, a similar gestation plan is not needed.
It measures everything the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
You know who you'd suggest to the finance minister?
I don't even think about it, because we're probably not even going to be in that government, and no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done.
That's not the point.
The elderly have received an entrepreneur, Grandpa, who would like to work with you, who may win the crown of your dedicated Jiří Chonka.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the association with the ANO, in ODS it may be the procedure of Václav Klaus ml., which will not be against either.
I'd like to leave it to the wolves.
Vice-President and Vice-President of UNO Richard Brabec said you have many common points with SPD Tomia Okamuri, for example in the area of the economy.
So the okamurists come to view it as a coalic partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura's got his political history, he's been running for the VV, then he's getting money from the Society for his company, he's got a shot.
Of course he's a great personality.
She's kind of nervous.
When I take his programme, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, which can be agreed.
I don't ask you any questions about it.
I'm wondering if a friendly person who has xenophobic views is talking to demonstrators and wants to come out of the EU?
We don't think of cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine it.
It's obvious he went to politics to benefit from it.
And what is the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but they decide.
It's gonna be a deal with each other in order, but God knows who's gonna win and who's two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on the Coalition Government programme.
Let's go back to your efforts to be a company.
But the government just had to run, Prime Minister Sobotka was going to let everything go, he never decided.
Coalities such as CHEB or EGAP did not work.
But Sobotka is his liar, and that was also my reason why he threw me out.
As soon as he did that, Chez ruled the Czech government.
It is, however, unbelievable that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the ČEZ management, which holds the finance ministers, how to vote at the ČEZ summit.
If you become a prime minister, will you change your personal measurements in the board review and change the top management of the ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm a prime minister, I'll see you.
I'm not her yet.
It's a shame that the Czechs have already sent a signal to your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to make it even better with the ANO.
Well, maybe after the calls, she'll eat it all over again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Lobbits or Roses, I'm an independent unit, and I don't even think of it.
So answer me directly.
If you are in the head of the government, will you force the change in management of the Czech TV or the General Health Insurance, then what institutions are you critical of?
I'd like Chez to be a transparent company.
He's been doing what he wanted for years, and thanks to the traditional political parties.
That's enough to check out Mr. Schwarzenberg's products.
Even though he's got a state in the Czech Republic, he never ordered it, he was just in the number, which is bad.
It's a trivial matter for me.
WHAT Dukovany has to take, evaluate it, throw it into the daughter's company, arrange funding, make an additional competition or hire a co-investor, and set up a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state has to finance and create new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her orders are leading a permanent campaign against me, but I don't and I won't have any competence to shoot anyone.
But control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that public payments for public advertising and television charges are 7.2 billion dollars a year, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How do you know he doesn't?
On the other hand, the report on their savings has a direct impact on the position of the general directors ČT and Čro.
See how those reports are being broadcast, on the great power package of Sobotka Godesek, which has always worked.
It pays for the most recent parliamentary commissions for the students from the research records, as well as for Lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let himself be pressured by God to throw me out of the government, which cost a percent of TOP 09, but ČSSD picked him up.
They're afraid of breaking their corrupt system, and they're talking about threatening Babies' democracy.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO Jaroslav Faltynek builds a powerful ground by bringing his son to the Council's view of the Tepláren Brno and by organizing a contract with the city and state companies, such as the Prague transport company or the Czech Drauties?
That's where we have a lasting peace.
I don't like it, and I read it several times.
The falcon argues that the reduced lawyer works mainly at lower rates and is proportionate.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the soybeans, never had a corrupt apheric, no Pelt, Kratochvil, Bresin.
If we had any sign of clientism, we've just fired such a man.
In this direction, I am uncompromising.
If something like that happens, we'll get rid of anyone, there's a whole bunch of people who would be.
