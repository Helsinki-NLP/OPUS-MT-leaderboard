Why are you in sore straits today?
"My father doesn't drink wine." "Even me and not."
Would You Welcome a Visit?
I belong to this area.
I want to share your plan.
Sorry, I forgot my password.
What prevented you from working?
Did he lose my bicycle?
I don’t believe you.
Tom did not want us to make decisions.
I have no need to apologize.
His main purpose in life is to become rich.
There is more to him than the right one.
I would go to the sea so that I could see your smile again.
Their hair is large.

We need to make an effort.
How long do you spend time with Tom?
Those people were very proud of them.
I am sure I understand everything.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Tom may have been a spy.
You must judge both of you.
I had a deep desire to learn how to do so.
I was wrong.
My people are Zamboanga.
Do not let him stand.
Tom had to go home.

We have a measure of dignity.
The Passover was to be held in the morning.
We need to get started.
Besides the importance of sleep, the purpose of this is a mystery.
I'm Tom's cousin.
Who else is there?
Tom will not win.
Surely I had to be left alone.
