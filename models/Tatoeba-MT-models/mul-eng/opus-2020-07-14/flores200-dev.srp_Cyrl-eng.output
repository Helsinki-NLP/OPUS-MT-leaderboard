The stars emit light and heat from energy that happens when hydrogen atoms sleep (ffusion) and form heavy elements.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it's going to last many years until we see the building of useful fusion reactors.
A glass of water filled with water after a surface attack.
The surface tension is due to the fact that the molecules are water on the surfaces of the water together strongly attracting, more than the case with the molecules air above them.
The molecules of water make an invisible skin on the surface, which enables things like needles to float on the water.
The modern cliché cliché has a double angle with a broken hole between them. Two angles enable better ice catchment, even when they're pressed.
Since the bottom part is well-closed, while the edge moves in one or the other side, the line that is in contact with the ice is also hidden.
This allows the clicks to turn off. If the clicks on the left, the clicks turn to the right, if the clicks to the left, the clicks to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they have to waste the higher energy they've gained from the light.
They do this by emitting a low-frequency light called "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulating radiation emissions" because atoms are stimulated by strong light, causing photo light emissions, and light is kind of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms that emit photos. Of course, photos are much smaller than those on the pictures.
The photons are even smaller than the things that make atoms!

The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
The blood continues to flow from the heart into the veins called arterials, and it returns to the heart of the veins called veins, the smallest tube is called capillaries.
Three-footed teeth could not only be left, but even very live grains and roots.
Some scientists think it's a tricerapus eating cicadas, which are kind of protein that was widely distributed during the cry.
These beads look like little palmes with a crown of sharp, shilish leaves.
Triceratops may have used his strong clon to remove the leaves before he ate the stable.
Other scientists claim that these whites are very toxic, so it's pretty likely that they were eaten by any dinosaur, even though today's legend and other animals like papayasa (dinosaurus seed) can eat poisonous waste or fruit.
What would the gravity of her satellite had to do with me? If you were to stand on the surface of her, you would have less weight than on Earth.
The person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on the Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg). So, the gravity of you, of course, is lower.
The sun has no root like the Earth on which you can stand, and the sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes all the order you're getting away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photoosphere, which means "low light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to prevent Venus from having me, just like the moon.
It's because it's only that side of Venus (or the moon) that's turned towards the sun.

There's a lot of theories about how Sankrit was raised, one of them is about the migration of Arijevac from the West to India, which then brought their own language.
Sankrit is an ancient language and can match the Latin, which has been used in Europe.
The most famous book in the world is written on Sanskrit.
Sankrit is a very complex and rich language, from which many modern Indian languages have developed, just as Latin was a subject of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the war on France, Germany began preparing for invasion on the island of Britain.
The German attack gave a code name "Operation Marine Law." Most of the heavy weapons and the British army were lost when she evacuated from Denmark, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy and could destroy any fleet attack that would have been sent through the English Channel.
However, very few ships were found near the likely conquerors' roads, since they were afraid that German air raids would strike them.
Let's go with an explanation of the plans of Italy, Italy was mainly "the younger brother" of Germany and Japan.
The army and the mariners were weak, although they had just built four (4) new ships right before the start of the war.
The main goals of Italy were the African countries, to win those countries, they would have to have a foundation for the launch of the troops, so that the troops could sail the Mediterranean Sea and carry out an invasion of Africa.
As a result, British bases and ships had to be destroyed in Egypt.
And now that it's about Japan, Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
The submarines were designed to travel under water and stay there for a long period of time.
The submarines were used in World Wars I and World War II, and then they were extremely controversial and had quite a limited fireplace.
At the beginning of the war, they mainly traveled over the surface of the sea, but as the radar began to develop and become more accurate, the submarines were forced to walk under water to avoid being trapped.
The German submarines were called U ships, and the Germans were very good at navigation and management of their submarines.
Because of their success with the submarines, after the German war, it didn't give much of them in possession.
King Tutankamon, sometimes called the King here or the "children of the King", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, it was not considered particularly important in ancient times and was not noted in most ancient royal records.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 turned it into a star, while many tombs from the past were stolen, this grave remained practically unaffected.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankomona are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stone.
The exception of the point with the suctions has made Assyrian horses easier, faster and more ready to cross soldiers and other horses.
The shootings from their deadly suicides could have broken down the army of the rivals, and about 1,000 B.C.E., the Assyrians had set up their first horse.
The horse is an army fighting on horses, and the seat hasn't been invented yet, so the Assyrian horse fought on the big back of horses.
We know of many Greek politicians, scientists and artists, probably the most famous person in this culture is Homer, a legendary blind singer, who composed two lines of Greek literature: songs of Iliad and Odyssey.

There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi, and it's estimated that by the number of speakers in the world, there's somewhere between the second and fourth places.
The number of speakers is different depending on whether they're counting very closely linked dialects.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million people who speak, and even 800 million people who can understand this language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar to dictionary, but they differ by letter; in everyday conversations, speakers can usually understand each other.
By the 15th century, northern Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monasteries wanted to draw closer to God’s native people, so they developed an Estonian language.

Europe's Turkey ( eastern Turkey or Romania on the Balkan Peninsula) makes 3% of the countries.
Turkey's territory is 1,000 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 km wide (500 mi), and it's almost right-wing.
The Turkish authorities, including lakes, take area of 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), from which 755,688 square miles (291,773 square miles) are located in Southeast Asia and 23.764 square kilometers (9174 square miles) in Europe.

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools to control interactive clocks (storibording, audio and video assembly, speech instruction, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to examine your thoughts about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires that the parts of the project be connected to each other, but also that they have meaning as special entities.
Mana zoom of the object is that it's smooth complexity and the number of elements of the object that are needed to achieve the range of light distances much higher than that of normal objects.
This becomes all the less a problem because manufacturers achieve more standards in their production.
This has enabled the zoom of objects to create images that can be sorted in quality with those that come with a concave with a fixed life distance.
Another lack of object zoom is what is maximum open (speed) pale object usually smaller.
Because of this, they're a cheap zoom that makes it hard to use without a brush in conditions when light is weak.
Overscan is one of the most common problems that happen when you want to convert a movie into a DVD format.
Most television is done in a way that will satisfy the wide audience.
For that reason, everything you see on TV has cut corners on top, bottom and side.
This is how the image will be shown across the screen. It is called "resize the screen width".
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges will probably also be cut, and if the video has titles that are too close to the bottom of the edges, they won't be seen in full.
The traditional middleman castle has long been a mammoth, calling for images of the battle of battle, fighting, and Artrian victory.
Even standing in the midst of thousands of years of old routing is easy to remember the sounds and smells of long-distance battleships, so you can almost hear the sound of the catacombs and calm down the fear as it climbs out of the darkness.
But is our map really based on why the castles are even built, how are they designed and constructed?
Typically for this period, Kirby Maxlow's castle is more established than the real castle.
His big interconnected windows and tanks of walls would not be able to withstand a decisive attack long ago.
When Lord Hastings began his construction in 1480, the land was relatively peaceful and protected only by small gangs of flying bullets.
The equality of power was a system by which European nations tried to maintain the sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept was that all European nations had to try to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and therefore national governments often changed their allies in order to maintain balance.
The war for the Spanish successor was the first war where the main problem was equal power.
This meant an important change, given that the European forces no longer had any excuse that they were religious wars, so the Thirty Years ’ War was the last war that was marked as a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 B.C.E. in a fire that had been identified by Herestrate.
According to tradition, he was motivated by fame at every price, and the angry Ephesians insisted that the name of Herestrate never appeared.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted that name, and that's why we are known today. The temple was destroyed the very night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to finance the temple again, but his proposal was not important.

Mysticism is a search for a direct link, an identity with, or a knowledge of the ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition or vision in divine reality/divinity or divinity.

Civilization was a flower in the pools of the Ind, which was named after.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization also existed in the pools now flooded with the Sarasvati River, it should rightly be called civilization of India and Sarajevo, while some of the Harapa civilization, according to Harapa, was first discovered in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire was of assistance in the development of medical progress.
King Augustus started with the appointment of a doctor, who even founded the first Roman medical corps to treat after the battle.
The surgeons had knowledge of various sedentaries, such as the Morphine obtained from the seed of the cat and the scopolomin from the seed of the rebels.
They've become skilled in amputation to save patients from gangrengue, as well as in the use of stencils and arterial cells to stop bleeding.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has made great progress in the field of medicine, which has significantly contributed to the knowledge we have today.
The Pyurland orchids are orchids where there is a limitation that can only be performed at the same time by just one block, more complex suggestions such as reverse suggestions are not allowed, and all suggestions have a certain location ahead of them.
He thought of John Smith over the past 70 years to facilitate the process of unskilled "skillers" or people with reduced motor skills.
Children develop a sense of race and race stereotypes pretty early and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who are raised with a racial minority of whom stereotypes are important to not go well in school, often and not go well in school after they hear about this stereotype that exists for their race.
MaySpices is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These web locations have received a lot of attention, especially in the educational context.
There are also positive aspects of these websites, which include the possibility to easily set the layout page on which blogs, videos, photos, and other plugins can be found.
This page can easily access only one web address, which makes it easy to remember and teach students who may have problems with using a keyboard or sleeping.
You can guess how reading would be easier and also with whatever little or much color you want.
The short attention span is "a neurological syndrome that generally define three symptoms, including pulse, racism and hyperactivity or high energy".
It's not a matter of learning, it's a learning gap; it's "a figure of 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe 2 million American children".
Children with anxiety are hard to focus on things like homework, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy, such as playing games or watching favorite drawings or writing words without spelling characters.
These children often fall into great trouble, because they "drive into risky behavior, but they challenge authority" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by conventional methods.
ADD affects relationships with other adults because other children can't understand why they behave the way they behave or why they write as they write or their level of maturity is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed in the above-mentioned way, the basic step by which knowledge has been acquired has been changed.
Access to information was denied. Pressing was no longer on a single visit, but more focus was placed on the ability to remember the text.
In fact, renaissance has led to a significant change in access to learning and disseminating knowledge.
Unlike other crops, hominids no longer use their hands for drawing, carrying wood or cutting wood.
The chassis and the foot of the chimpanzees are similar to the size and length, which is a reflection of the fact that the chassis is used to carry weight during the dive.
The human chess is shorter than the foot, and there's the right pieces of ring.
Fossil bones of the hands of the old two to three million years reveal this change in the specialization of hands from drawings to manipulation.
Some people believe that the experience of a lot of artificially engineered lucid respirators can often be very frustrating.
The main reason behind this phenomenon is the result that Lucid news increases the length of time between Rome's state.
With less REM phase every night, this condition in which you actually experience the right sleep and your body recovers so rarely to begin to represent the problem.
This is just as disturbing as getting up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching television.
The effect depends on how often after one night your brain tries to sleep badly.
The Italians in North Africa did not go well from the very beginning. Within a week of the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th horse puk was arrested by Capucio in Libya.

Eighty-six rounds are played during regular rounds, and players usually start on the first hole on the ground and end on the suspect.
A winner is a player who at the end of the game receives the least hit or the least way to close the ball.
The game is playing on the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut short and it's called green.
Maybe the most common form of tourism is what people do with travel: recreational tourism.
It's when people travel to a place that offers something far different from their daily routines to relax and have fun.
Beaches, thematic parks and campsites are usually the most visited places for recreational tourists.
If someone's purpose is to travel to a certain place to get to know his history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as a cultural tourism.
Tourists can taste different characteristics of certain countries or determine only one area.
Colonists, seeing this activity, also called for strengthening.
Groups that strengthened previous positions included 1 and 3 of 200 men, led by Colonels John Stark and James Ride (both later became generals).
The ancient people took positions along the fence at the north end of the Colonist position.
When the lake created a lake along the Mystic River along the north-west half of the island, they quickly extended the building with a short stone wall towards the north, which ended on the shores of water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a car at 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to shoot until the replay was over.
The U.S. plan rested on the implementation of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Codweller would launch a variety of attacks on the British Garnizon in Bordentown to prevent the strengthening.
General James Young would take 700 militia members across the river to Trenton Fairy, take the bridge across Asanpink River and prevent enemy troops from escape.
The main attack team of 2400 men would cross the river nine miles from Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under the leadership of Green and one under the leadership of Sullivan, so that the attack would take place before the mountains.
By increasing distance from a quarter to half a mile, speed starts to play a lot less role, and sustainability becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, a first-class runner in half a mile, a man who can run a race for less than two minutes, must have a relative speed, but endurance must be developed at every opportunity.
Some natural runoffs during winter combined with gymnasium exercises for the upper part of the body are best prepared for the run season.
I can't just get to the best performances, but I can significantly influence the overall status of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, applying effective hygiene habits, and understanding the different aspects of the application of the supplement can help athletes to improve their performance and increase their enjoyment in sport.
Running in the middle of the bridge is relatively cheap sport; however, there are many mistakes about several parts of the equipment that you need to participate.
Products can be bought as needed, but most will have little or no influence on performance.
Sportsmen may feel that they prefer some product even when it doesn't bring real benefits.
Atom can be considered one of the main units of the city's entire matter.
It's a very complex universe that, according to the simplified Burov model, consists of the central lake around which the electrons surround, the planets that surround the sun -- see picture 1.1.
Nucleus is made up of two particles - neutron and proton.
Protons have positive electrodes until neutrons don't have electricity, electrons have negative electrodes.
To check the victim, you must first examine the faces of the places in order to ensure your safety.
You must note the position of the victim as you approach it as any automatic warning signs.
If you hurt yourself in an attempt to help, it will only make the situation worse.
Research has shown that depression, fear and disaster situations affect the relationship between pain and disability in those who suffer from pain in the lower part of the back.
Only disaster effects, not depression and fear, were conditions for regular weekly structured physical activity
Those who are involved in regular activities have asked for more support when they are dealing with negative perceptions of pain, comparing chronic pain and feeling uncomfortable from normal physical growth.
Look, or the ability to see, depends on the hearing organs of the visual system or the eye.
There are many different structures of the eye, which vary in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.
Different structures have different possibilities, sensitive to different parallel lengths and different degrees of sensitivity, and they also require different ways of doing things to understand the input elements and different numbers to do optimally.
The population is a set of certain types of organisms within the data of the geographical area.
When all the individuals in the population are identical in terms of certain phenotypic characteristics, they are known as monomorphs.
When individuals show several variants of certain characteristics, they're polymorphic.
The military colony smells and also snows in different phases.
During the nomad phase, the black soldiers march through the night, and the day takes a break and form a camp.
The column begins its nomad phase when the food is made available. During this phase, the column is made up of temporary ants that change every day.
These nomad migrations or marches usually last about 17 days.
The word cell is derived from the Latin word "cell", which means "small room", and the first was scaled by the microscope that looked at the structure of the flat.
The cell is the primary unit of all living beings, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and necessary to investigate life, so often called "rural blocks of life".
The nervous system maintains homeostase by sending nerve pulses through the body so that the flow of blood is maintained and flown undetected.
These nerve impulses can be transmitted so quickly throughout the body that it helps to protect the body from potential threats.
Tornada's falling down a small area in comparison with other broken holes, but they can destroy everything they find on their way.
Tornada cut trees out of the roots, throw up the tables from the building and the roof of the car into the sky, two percent of the tower is the most transparent and lasting for more than three hours.
The wind of these monsters goes up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles per hour).
People are doing and using the puzzle to increase thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes have used the combination of two layers to allow remote objects to work closer and closer.
The beauty and selfishness will always be with us, and the nature of cooperation is so that when most are useful, it will soon get more and more by acting selfishly.
Let's hope that most people will realize that it's the best option for them to work together with others.
Many dream of the day when people will be able to travel to some other stars and explore other worlds, some people ask themselves what is there, and some believe that aliens or other forms of life can live on some other planet.
But if this ever really happens, it probably won't happen for a long time.
Maybe one day your traitors will stand in an unknown world asking about their ancient ancestors?
The animals are made of a large number of cells, they eat things and smell them inside.
Only animals have brains (though not all animals; media, for example, have no brains).
Animals are everywhere on the planet, digging through the earth, swimming in the oceans and flying into the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of the living organism.
The word cell is derived from the Latin words of the cell, meaning a little room.
If you look at the living beings under the microscope, you'll see that they're made of small squares or balls.
Robert Huck, biologist from England, drew a little square on the flats with a microscopic help.
He was the first person to look at dead cells.
Elements and units can be moved from one state to another, without changing.
Asots like gas still have the same properties as liquid nitrogen.
Water is another example of water being made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
There's the same molecular structure, regardless of whether it's gas, liquid or solid matter.
Although his physical condition can change, his chemical condition remains the same.
Time is something that's all around us and affects everything we're doing, and it's hard to figure it out again.
Time is spent thousands of years by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars.
We're experiencing time as through events that pass from the future through the present to the past.
With the help of time, we sort out the length (length) of the event.
You can set a time interval by yourself, so you'll see the repetition of cycle events. The cyclist event is something that happens regularly again and again.
Computers are being used to sell pictures and videos today.
sophisticated animations can be made on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly used on television and film.
Music is often filmed using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
For a long time during the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who had been hunting giant birds for my name.
The theory then confirmed the difficulty that Maori migrated from Polynesia to the Great Fleet and took over New Zealand of Morior, creating a rural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mariners who migrated from New Zealand to Chatham Island, and developed their special, peaceful culture there.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham islands; it was the Maori who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriors, and after a few mistakes, the Moriors were removed from the face of the Earth.
Individuals who have been involved for several decades have helped us to appreciate our advantages and stress while openly assessing difficulties, even failures.
Hearing how individuals share their unique, family and organization of stories, we have gained a precious insight into the past and some of the personalities that have had a good or bad influence on the culture of the organization.
Although understanding some stories does not mean understanding culture, it still helps people to get a sense of where their place is in the history of this organization.
As they evaluate success and become aware of failure, individuals and the entire group of participants are more deeply aware of the values, mission and organizational strengths.
In this case, a reminder of previous cases of entrepreneurial behaviour and resulting success has helped people to open up for new changes and new editors of local churches.
Such stories of success lessened the fear of change, and thereby creating a positive tendency to change in the future.
Convergent opinions are techniques for solving problems that unite different ideas or areas in order to find solutions.
The focus of this way of thinking is speed, logic and precision, as well as identifying facts, reusing existing techniques, collecting information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is that there is only one accurate answer.
This kind of thinking is related to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this kind of thinking are thinking logical, able to remember patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
People are far from the most talented species in reading the thoughts of other people.
That means we can successfully predict what other people feel, think, believe, know, or want.
Among these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is key, which enables us to resolve the possible double meanings of physical activity.
For example, if you could see someone break the window of a car, you would probably imagine trying to steal a car from an unknown person.
He should have a different judge if he'd lost the keys to his car and if he'd try to break into his own car.
MRT is based on a physical phenomenon called the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered by Felix Bloh in 1930 (working at Stanford University) and Edward Perssel (with Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves make atoms leave small radio signals.
Raymond Damadian, a doctor and a scientist, discovered in 1970 the basis for using magnetic resonance as a device for medical diagnosis.
Four years later the patent was approved, and it was the first published patent in the area of MRT.
Dr. Damadian finished the construction of the first "whole body" MR scanner in 1977 and called it "Neucrotif".
Asynchronous communication takes time to reflect and react to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and to have control over the time of departure.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints with the potential of a flexible working time. — Bremer, 1998.
The use of the Internet and global communications networks allows instant access to information for those who want to learn.
Students can also ask instructors questions at any time of the day and can expect pretty fast answers, instead of waiting for the next term of consultation.
Post-modern access to education promotes freedom from absoluteism. There are more ways to learn.
In fact, there is not only one good thing to learn, but learning is the key to interaction between the one who teaches and the one who knows before him.
Our current experience with all the "do yourself" teams and presenting information, television broadcasts that are based on learning well show the point.
So many of us are watching television broadcasts that inform us of processes or experiences in which we will never learn, nor will we ever use that knowledge.
We'll never repair the car, build a fountain in our yard, drive to Peru to examine the old ravines or reorganize the neighbor's house.
Thanks to the underground cable links with optical trains to Europe and the broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population that has access to the Internet.
Your hotel or home (if you stay in a pension or a private home) will probably have a running internet or a computer connected to the Internet, and all the peoples have an Internet coffee or some location with a public airport.
As mentioned above, although the word "Eskim" is still accepted in the United States, many non-American Arctic peoples, especially in Canada, consider it to be proud.
Although you can hear that word in the talk of the Greenlandese elders, foreigners should avoid it.
The older Greenlandians call themselves Inuits in Canada and Kalalek (many Calalit), Greenlandians, in Greenland.
Crime and, in general, anonymity to foreigners is practically not available in Greenland, even in the cities there are no "dangerous areas".
A cold time may be the only real danger facing those who are unprepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (in view of what you go north will be colder), it is essential that you wear enough warm clothes.
Very long summer days can lead to a problem of sleep failure and all other related health problems.
Look at the Nordic comets during the summer, even if they don't carry any diseases, they can be ironic.
