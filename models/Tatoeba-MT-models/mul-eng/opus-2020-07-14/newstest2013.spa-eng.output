A Republican strategy to impede Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last myth a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
In contrast to what is happening in Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same line, most of the American governments have enacted new laws that have made the process of registration or voting difficult since 2009.
This phenomenon was extended after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced during 2011 restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce the earlier voting periods, invalidate the right to be elected as elector on the day of expulsion and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with previous criminal acts.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity document with a photograph.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law.
As a result, the Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other States.
In recent years, these authorities have supported draft laws in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with a photograph.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the social security card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million elderly people, do not have any identity document with photographs issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 are missing an identity document with these characteristics.
Often, however, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions, therefore, affect disproportionately young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, about 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have an identity document with photography.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who vote most to democratic candidates cannot use the identity document with photographs issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of the fishing or hunting clubs to vote in the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required citizenship proof to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present that requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two of the three Spanish electors support the democratic party.
On the other hand, in 2011 the Republican legislators upheld certain laws that abolished electoral registration on the same day as the eight states.
In addition, the right of persons and groups to create a service of assistance to electors who would like to be enrolled was limited.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the register of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have achieved that the registration rate of new voters will fall in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the voting period per advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in favour were African Americans, while the latter represented more than 13 per cent of the state electors.
In the case of Hispans, the same would be true.
These represent more than 11 per cent of the voters, which is equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
However, whites, which represent 76 per cent of the elected, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the register of electors.
In this regard, democratic governance has blocked several draft laws.
The U.S. Ministry of Fiscal intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit damages.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law which required the presentation of an identity document with a photograph.
However, it is unlikely that the new rules adopted will make the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat critics claim the party's character in the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they intend to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the States that have adopted those laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too ready to confirm with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, measures will be part of the American democratic system.
Prostat cancer detection: Is the test performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test presents, on occasion, wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform unusable medical interventions.
It's more than enough to make men doubt, already recent, about whether or not the detection tests should be done.
Is the test done or not?
We've asked for advice from two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, a large number of contact points among sample groups were detected, so it is difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
The European study, for its part, showed a difference in mortality among patients who had been diagnosed and who did not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, further showed that between 30 and 40 per cent of patients with metastasis had not been tested.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if your father has had prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are inolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the level of risk of his cancer. All possible options should be offered to him and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not concern life for the long term, in which case he should be better chosen for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since that cancer is not aggressive or leads to a risk to their life.
Instead, we suggest that they be actively monitored and, if this progress is made, we offer them treatment.
We have more and more frequently determined the criteria needed to determine who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be performed or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Association of Urology, a tool that allows for assessing the pros and cons of the PSA test.
This document can be downloaded (for the moment only in English, but will be offered in a few languages) at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, that rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, the Canadian Society's spokesman against cancer.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tobaccoism remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today for today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said Porter André Beaulieu.
A promising date: 10 years after quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fatigue and obesity also promote the occurrence of disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and right cancer, esophagus, pancreas and autor cancer.
"Research shows that regular exercise of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
The feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering a colorectal cancer.
Charge products should also be avoided.
Conservation of the meat for its ahumid, dry or salted may cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years several scientists have studied the links between vitamins and cancer.
However, its investigations are not yet complete.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another observed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined either.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of discussing the concerns and family history of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs mailbox in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boss generated a great excitement last summer, and rightly.
In fact, it is believed that this boss is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is about the particle whose existence predicts the standard model: our best or "bader" explanation of the nature and behavior of the matter, which has not yet been observed imperially.
But for physicists it's not quite clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it seems very much to Higgs' boss who preached by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physical convention held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be fully safe.
Anyway, let's assume that it's Higgs, because there's a few possibilities of making mistakes, and we'll see what's going on.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inexhaustible law which means that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and do not try too hard, because it will end with harm.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law on these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "cantic state"; a "state" which consists, in a large way, of some of its characteristics.
Physicals classify particles in two categories.
On the one hand, we find good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey the principle of Paul.
And on the other hand, they are the bosses, a suscis panda of anarchists who has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories that, of course, is extraordinary, the bosses are divided into two groups: the months, of which we will not talk here, and the "force parts", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which Higgs' bosses would be in some impressive way.
These bosses, I'd like to underline here, aren't the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it's thanks to an extraordinary balalbone: the photo or the "light part" that acts as a "messer" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an accelerated electric load or a change of direction, "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone to a wall.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photo; that is, one of the bosses "power carriers".
more stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boss, with the difference that it is from another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "unsorted" to make this boss appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it requires extremely high energy, a little as if it were to be treated with a heated tincture in which only one green rock could slide across the surface.
As a result, there is a huge acceleration of particles like the CERN (the great colicator of hadones is a 27 km angle of circumference!) to achieve such energy levels.
Analogue with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the Iimas, do it, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself at the door of a snow.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (such as the photo, of course) do not.
Now, what can all these investigations bring?, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to distinguish between MS observations and predictions.
On the other hand, many sincerely wish to be found, since the minor difference could open a door to a "new physical" that hit certain angles of the model.
This has to be said, there are still huge gaps, such as that it does not suggest any explanation about gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which corresponds to around 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of such research in our day are difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong by saying that there will be no one.
To see: at the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in the laboratories did not completely question the revolution that their work would cause.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that he developed the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, the laser was generally considered a "laborator device".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also take place from all instruments surrounding the investigation.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a light capturer in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this capturer now serves as "eye" for all the world's digital devices, which was valued by the Nobel physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC are necessarily to transform our lives, but it is never known...
Paliative care. The best way to die...
In his Death Commission, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a draft law is drawn up.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Debir tried to see him looking.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breathing for two years.
"I've been given five years of life, but I've already taken seven," she reported, made a pass, thrown in her bed at the Victor-Gadbois Palais Center of Beloeil, where she arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused him harm: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of a pleasant dinner, accept the assignment to help him eat.
Valiente, he even comes to smile, talk to strangers who pay attention to him, take medications and offer him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that they cure me for diarrhoea, it's humiliating," she confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that disease.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes a foot piece," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that repentance," he said.
Because, according to the majority of people working in palliative care, the great moments have a place in the heart itself of the repentance.
All patients entering Victor-Gadbois hospital care are suffering from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides "curatives".
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and angry".
But the disease has made her discover to her children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any more desires in this life," he says, before accepting that a male is placed to help her breathe.
And she's waiting for her son's last visit in Italy the next few days.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and assistance in feeding.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small, because we all know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
It's either the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you are offered oral injections with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of daily life.
Yesterday night we served him a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son ended the funeral at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Natalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois center, the days pass without ever being equal.
On the side of a 94-year-old man who enjoyed his last family meeting in the patio, well placed between his lunches while all drink to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age who have cancer," continues Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisariven center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, either at his home, at the hospital or at a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois centre and the community of palliative care at the home of the Grand Montreal, are almost exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a demonstration signed by emissaries of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been on the move to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not sufficiently competent to ensure that anyone is entitled to palliative quality care before it is agreed upon with euthanasia.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get the proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are confined to their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosticities.
Hélène Richard's prospects for survival were already low when he gave up an agonist chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my uncle that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"But she had told me that there was nothing more to do!"
No Superpower Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who ask for death are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it has to be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the home of Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in an 8 per cent case.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palative sessions, which serve to sleep to the patient until the time of their death, either in a sporadic or permanent manner.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
More and more, the unsatisfied disease will have the possibility of having this palliative session.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want some comfort."
The implementation of this report has been possible thanks to the periodical of Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel network operators, BTP entrepreneurs, policy fund collectors and experts of Italian mafia account, day after day, of what they know of a formidable "system" of which they form part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafios.
A "industrial" that came out too dear to the Quebecese contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's amazing how the system is pumped once we've hit the big media," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a former head of Montreal Police in Quebec.
He led the establishment of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the distortions related to road contracts in Quebec, which the first liberal minister, Jean Charrest, at the time, had allowed him to delay.
The Duchessneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of the parties and corruption among officials.
"From the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved thousands of dollars in contracts," including some of its attempts to stay with a proportion.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen to two alcalades", adds, while it is expected to be able to "show the existing strategism behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also applies with its government intervention team, investigators and analysts.
This unit also serves as the police of the "Marteau Army", which, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of the Canary Islands" fashionable at the time of contract collapse.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registered in a series of charges of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of the Aförs.
The next of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just left his post at Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that we have been reimbursed for the exchange of public contracts.
It has been formally accused of engineers from the Montreal road network and Italian origin entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused confusion when explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for three years to an intermediary related to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to distro and sisno during the 2000s, offering more than $88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fund collection for the former liberal minister, Natalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of auction contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a public worker, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and business associates in the construction sector for a total of $736.000, all of which in exchange for auction contracts whose costs affect.
Other network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices between 30 per cent and 40 per cent for extra counterfeiting.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately having made the heavy view of a parallel budget and filled his pocket wallets.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned early in November and brought Montreal to a massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first election policies that made the alarm sound.
As a mayor of the Rivière-des-Praiies district, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired by $5 million and sold by 1.6 million to promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money of the electoral campaigns was sweet money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she takes "from a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by Hormigues, to stop the gangrene and fish for the guilty."
And it adds that the process is "dangerous, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful not to repeat questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is concerned primarily about the role of "elected politicians in the current of the strike".
estimating in 70% the proportion of suction money that has been allocated to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironizes: "They have told me that that is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Czech Government proposes to limit contributions to parties to $100, but that will not change the grant, he said, "as long as electoral costs are not strictly limited, there will be money in politics".
It recommends a complete review of the public procurement and funding system of the parties: "We cannot fall below; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story pushes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who want to look at the mirror.
"PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This period has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would I explain that progress?
It could be explained by individual awareness taking, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day-to-day advance to your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements force me to raise the level of my game every day.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
But I don't like it.
From my beginnings in the InF Clairfontaine Preformation Centre to my step by Saint-Etienne, I've always made progress on these steps.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruits of this summer are accustomed to dispute very high-level parties.
They know each training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has a lot to do with my position.
It's supported by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelots inspire respect for all techniques.
Today, there is no equal in Linka 1 and is among the best European trainers.
It has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think other titles will be taken to Paris.
In January he had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the period?
In League 1, Lyon has removed us from the leadership position.
But we're still on the embossed.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Championships: we have classified us for the final octaves with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have much to say to many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin, to finish our first link to the Opportunity so that we can receive the return of the final octaves.
Can PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He's got the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris has to gain titles and be there for a long time.
Today for today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is being delivered to its means to ensure that the project is concrete.
Don't win the cup in League 1, like in the last time, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in carrying that title of champions.
We're not getting far in the last time.
In May we were disappointed, because we had excellent conditions to end first.
We had a strong period.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better time.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if large teams like Marsella, Lyon and Burdeos fight for the title, I think we have weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media expect more than PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, which is still with things that make up for us is a little frustrating.
Let's ask ourselves what people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the League of Campaigns, we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two periods, it has not been able to qualify for final eighths, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the invested sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of profit to the day.
That would be a disappointment to our opponents and the champion of France.
Lyon and Marsella, who were not well in the past, have been "inspired" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished carrying the trophie.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's success.
We better say we have a Zlatang Independence.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he has many voices.
He's come to prove it's the star of League 1.
And he's proved in all the teams that's happened to be a great player, a global star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What you've done is really exceptional.
That motivates others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live the Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very enthusiastic about participating in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from amassing time to play.
I saw things there and I got strengthened.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and we must have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Dischamps in front of the blues?
Getting results.
They are well located in the classification group for the World.
The chooser is strict, close to the players and inspires you to win.
Like Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc made it his goal to classify us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the election to Brazil.
Did the empath (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to establish the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everybody.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never lived a game like this in all my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without bank
All of this is contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
In addition, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is once a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to the same.
Some 200,000 transactions have been recorded using 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a form of payment.
The cost of the bitcoin, after arriving at the top of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning to the $10 (the rates are calculated on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not surprising if we compare it with the world's changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "who competes with the dollar or the euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual money such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even on changing occasions).
The Facebook social network has also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time depositors of accounting books, verifiers, currency stations and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing the anonymous.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes in bitcoins are contained in the public account book, which is spread across the network.
The key point is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that supplementary line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital hole.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "trace" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular needle (more serious at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructible linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the hole.
If, in order to make a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be horfan, as both have different holes.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to a hundred million, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its heights.
The websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The error used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the money actually presents the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse such payments.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80 per cent of non-circuit bitcoins.
In November, the giant peaks were launched.
"The $30,000 has changed," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns the Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this coin, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which will make it cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to run in trade, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It's enough to provide them with a direction that a phone can "photo and recognize", needs Pierre Noizat, who ensures thousands of users.
There is a general motion for revision of the hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"There will be a time for Bitcoin to be pressured, but in 2013 there may be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB intends to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if this money is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapas and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army withdraws possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without expecting any of us.
We have punished especially the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of foreign army, such as in times of Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if for their reasons the Yihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks or Thais are united.
Tolerance, sometimes even assisted by local insurers, will no longer be the case when the western ones become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of the Nijrab, which has been observed since the height of the hills planted with almendra thanks to the French credits, has been done by order.
The trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influence in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistibility between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was engaged in fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Its control of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their champions passed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujaidins, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making it with government land to resale them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the couple of enormous U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are disappointed; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, appeal to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population less than 25 years old, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state colleges are full of both girls and children.
There will be work to those young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All of them, including the armed opposition, are equipped with mobile phones. The television and its publications presenting a modern world have great admiration throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet war are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, who will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization of the Western nations; however, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, with a strong presidential power, by removing the position of the first minister existing under the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly due to the elections planned in April 2014.
However, her country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has restored its services, has not set up any exchanges or has repaired important irrigation systems.
Everything is imported and nothing but fruit and vegetables are produced.
The priority lies in the private initiative.
In a country destroyed after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumors that Afghanistan had vast mineral wealth were spread.
And that only made him feel that the westerns were there to support themselves.
No energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak's copper mines, leaving international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavated the vast Buddhist site and remained there as the most important employers in the province.
There will also be a need for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country in which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore their normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: colleges of girls, colleges of children, a department of French at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agriculture, and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of "encouraging the hearts and spirits" and carrying out the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a service of "citizen and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cicic), which was removed in 2012, has been carried out through a small French NGO through numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in decades of mountain sites.
These works, eager to obtain local work, have helped to contain insurrection: rice, posos, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increase in crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received ten written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the surprise carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and that it comes directly to them.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full power, it has decided to play all over it.
He believed throughout the world that the miracles were miraculous, when he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote for its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And almost two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial errors.
This new initiative has done more than increase the country's broken down.
For his opponents, the president continued in his "autocratic deliberation" and continued "training his word" and "depositing the right".
On the basis of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a step towards a faster end to the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short time ago, the brothers were forced to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover popular and democratic legitimacy while the Polish cause is terrible throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted out very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the people of Egypt: "or they vote for my text or I keep the full powers," powers that are supposed to come to their end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Constitutional Assembly, Islamist in the vast majority, voted yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they thought they could not evaluate their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added to all the arrests by morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I expected, the articles voted for have been unanimously.
The commentators, on the other hand, thank them for the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so that several members of the committee came to the conclusion that the constitutional watch was wrong.
The text, which was still voting yesterday, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of all the views remains identical to the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source of the law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of its good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals hold it out of hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than a advertising article.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular for all who must confirm their compliance with the Sharia laws.
According to expert in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premiums of a theocracy."
The fears of liberals are further increased by the fact that the next director of this university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on that text are not blind but university students, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Bluet, who prepares a thesis on the constitutional transition from Egypt.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, etc.].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent the civil judges are competent to declare themselves above all of this."
In addition to its religious nature, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms regarding the extended powers entrusted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will declare that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflict point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
There will also be no ban on the processing of civilians in military courts, as requested by human rights-deficiency associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberal.
The crime of blasphemia remains and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, including Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the President of Egypt had to go out in the evening on television, demonstrations were scheduled for this afternoon.
The party members of the Head of State showed up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the world's obstacle and a sea of sand
The Promised Land combines the Majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a noble nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that whoever enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the turning of water into wine in the wedding, walking over the water, the freezing of the storm and the full nets.
At the same time, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places is located in Jerusalem.
The believers here use the Viacrucis or the Path of the Cross of Jesus (Latin "Via Painless Life").
Starting at the Fortaleza de Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continued on the streets of the Viaja City, he went to St. Sepulcro in Mount Gólgota, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian obligation of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of the Lamentation; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then be realized.
Perform a vertical move
The ruins of the Masada Fortaleza were what remained of a secret shelter against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in 25 C.E. for his family.
It is located on the mountain slopes at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who dedicate themselves to the ladder.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funnel.
And in the north of the country to a height of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski station, where in winter there is a great influence of tourists.
So far, bus services are offered from the hill foot.
The total length of ski tracks is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain they were supposedly inhabited by pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On a single trip, you can't visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Manusscripts of the Dead Sea or Scrolls of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings it has links of impressionors and expressors such as Monnet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha pool, which are some old Turkish bathrooms with models of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or sweat shops there.
The entry is free, and no donations are categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas cameras.
You enter him and you find you in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they call the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea it is even in winter months, since the water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is still warmer and falls there all year round.
Of course, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the bottom of the planet: 417 m below the sea level.
The blue waters there are a salmon that easily sustains up to those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around are really beautiful.
People come here to go through treatment courses with salt water, salt and curative bars and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronquitis, diabetes and to order their nervous convulsions.
Touching the mysteries of old age
It preserves the old part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
For her, the famous sea route was one of Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, he was here where Noah built his ark and Perseo saved the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists like to travel through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mism" symbol, fortune will be a favor to you.
In Jaffa there are recently married couples from all parts of Israel, including other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can pass through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the saints.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Remember the tourists
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much more than you wish: in this country about 30% of the Russian-speaking population.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shawls (currently 1-3$,8 shawls).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a rapid turn and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it's a subterranean funnel.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 bicycles and can therefore travel by ship within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath was celebrated.
From Friday night to Sunday's sunset, markets and shops will close and public transport will interrupt their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new working week.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels only serve Kosher food, which excludes meat from the sea, fish without rocks and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on cow and goat meat, soups and dishes prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a large variety of salads, the falafel, which are mollusc balls, fruit and vegetables.
In the streets of the cities of Israel there are no streets.
On the contrary, there are many well-fooded cats that "have their tastes" in an impotence.
By night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The roroners love the competitive places and do not refuse the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it's $15 a day.
And the rent of a bike will be paid for 15 check-ins a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, the amount exceeding 51 per cent of the same index for 2010, before the visa regime was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will bring you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While human rights defenders and defenders discuss the consequences of the compulsory review law, they have already appeared in the country of fear that they are dealing with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money to help your families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force on which each migrant must carry out an examination to verify its knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community services institutions, domestic services and trade at least.
However, with time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, exams will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be sufficient to render the language examination, unless it is also the Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language should be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the permit to work.
It is the exception for citizens from countries where Russian is the official language.
Those who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the Soviet Union resolution in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Admissibility, feasibility and defence of rights
The research centres network will operate under the auspices of the Russian Institute of Language Pushkin, the University of Amistad de los Pueblos, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, even now in Russia more than 160 centres of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by members of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But the defenders of rights, long before the law came into force, were often able to ask the press this question: What will this really bring?
What changes will result from the obligation to know the language, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
Firstly, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "working slavery".
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representative of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of its rights must be initiated before its departure.
Only an organized selection system will allow the problem of migrant workers to be resolved in a 90 per cent case.
The problems are those of non-professional immigrants, education, those who don't know the language, and those who don't have medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebrev says that the immigrant will be condemned to find people who, with the intention of helping him, put a "paying ticket" into an exploratory and close cowacha, where he and dozens of others like him spend months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise something, but when they arrive, they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they don't pay their promised wages," the Chief of the Employment Immigration Service of Tajikistan's Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov, confirms.
Don't get in, man!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize not only that they do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also that they write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much your fault but your own degradation: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, tayyikos can be given the chance to receive normal primary education.
This should make your families even have nothing to give to children, because they don't talk to them anymore to dress them, dress them and buy them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys get to work for the first time.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
"One feels humble and lower."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and, as a result, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers still live illegally in Russia.
Welcome or ban the passage to strangers
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
Moreover, legislation costs money: from twelve thousand to twelve thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for only one thousand-five rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and the cases of exorcism appear.
"We're asking hundreds of rubles for cigarettes or tea," said the journalists to the citizens of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Let's go, don't be a takaman, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was demonstrated that not only immigration registration documents could be false.
Several "false" language-knowing certificates have already been included by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed in standard colour printers.
Of course, new owners did not receive the gift: each immigrant, wishing to facilitate the work of conducting the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and half more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, convince government officials and rights defenders.
To date, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully conducted the first time review to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illicit arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater precision in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: To appreciate shootings during wedding celebrations where there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, where Apretar lost seven people.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on the possession of weapons would be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, have demanded that they refrain from such "unreasonably security".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, he commented on Russia's BBC news service, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 fire-recorded weapons were committed during the six months of 2012 against the total of 1168 registered crimes for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a stricter legislation in the field of civilian weapons will not be an inconceivable for the offender to be placed on the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at low prices.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to offices
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Supreme State.
Screenshot of a web site that accepts weapons requests
The first, "sweet of the army or military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officials and the same caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black gun", stolen by criminals and representatives of security forces.
Baranets explains that the weapons of police storage and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies are included here.
The illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there have often been explosions.
"There are evidenced versions that some fires have been caused primarily to cover the lack," he said.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their iron granite.
"They have now distributed private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is the contraband.
A large number of guns and amplifiers come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they count on their own production, sometimes artesanal, and a mafia that has organized the flow of weapons has been formed," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated what is the close participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problems Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminal bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "on behalf of officials whose work is related to weapons", says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during arms production and 5 per cent correspond to "illegal archeology".
The dependant of one of the arms stores, who asked his appellant not to be mentioned, said that the weapons found by illegal excavators had not been bought by anyone for a long time since they were too old.
More often, he says, suppliers are directed to military storage when they need a game.
Through an offer, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
Remove the register and pass it over the valley.
"This takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two carriers," we say
"But, of course, the police are doing so much of all the cases, so that regularly, when the crime detection plan has to be carried out, they are carrying out proof purchases for illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"As in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer often find themselves through acquaintances.
"Visit web pages and blogs until a guy I've proposed to go to "Begovaya" platform where I would be a man who would take me to a "skinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the weapon, I'll only be there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store's dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there is also a need to arrive, we say "by Mr Ivanovich, who asked him to tell him that a tooth had fallen on his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also provides them to me only because he knows I'm not going to let you down.
New ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on this issue was available.
The schematics, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where he didn't have "all."
"I felt like a luxury shop," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer him a cat for libre: everything that is available can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy it; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white one.
"Give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm sure that the gun is going well, we start to negotiate," the expert describes the procedure.
Table of Contents
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to purchase "for different purposes".
This does not require any document or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they wrote under the notice "Buy a gun or a amplifier".
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And sell the minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (contained spelling).
"Compro gun TT. Moscú", lacónically invokes the question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of physical websites and captures two hands to those who want to buy firearms.
And the people go, like a wild fish to the grass, and then, to extract carbon in Siberia.

I have heard about these systems: the website is generally registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People make requests.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reported the NGO press secretary "The right to weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that if a request is made online, one is left without a gun and put him in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of physical websites and captures two hands to those who want to buy firearms.

Macarov per $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half will have to be expected.
It is sent from military stores by middle-range leaders.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which is 22.900, and the number of cases identified as theft and destruction of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive artifacts decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fast and supermarketed food restaurants in the United States are under arrest.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cheeses in "McDonald's"
In the last days, a low-paid protest hall has been launched in the United States, which is paid in Walmart's supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Freed Chicken".
For now no one dares to know whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose forces and fall into its first stages.
The protest actions include the support of trade unions and a number of left NGOs.
In addition to the increase in wage patterns perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the objective of protest organizers is to create trade unions in these companies.
So far, this sector of the economy has not been practically occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the day of Gracias Action, called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States, the rebirth organ that was captured by millions of people, and sometimes it was accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some workers from the Walmart corporation, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protests with trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's shops, whose products are directed to moderate and moderate people.
Walmart sells from all over, from pants, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, even aspirators, eggs and milk.
Products in their stores are medium between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers only buy on the job.
The availability and output of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critical words, Walmart can allow the luxury to sell products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its employees.
These latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as lack of mounts or hand scanners.
The "Black Friday" was demanded by the participants of the exhibition to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation was 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost him $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it costs in wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase in consumers' members, each visit to the store will only result in 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the huge amount of $12,39 more than they are currently spending.
Walmart's supporters comment on the satisfaction that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any damage to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from 8 p.m. to midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its registering boxes carried out almost 100 million transactions by the Black Virgins.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview at the Huffington Post left website, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been more than "other public relations" organized by the trade union.
"Free cup!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not exactly the large Walmart stores (which in this progressive city they do not appreciate, and therefore no one is present), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of pieces, and then they don't even give you a drop of disease and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Mr. Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, in accordance with the federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one wins less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something I don't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of the American adolescents went through McDonald's and worked there, behind the shows, partly after school, though they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or were planning to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly miss some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live out of this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in a Wall Street Journal forum that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he doesn't know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the horses and cooks of fast food start paying at least $15 per hour, i.e. double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits administration from prohibiting this right and punishing the activists of the union movement with arguments and dissuasiveness.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for the trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the principals is the excessive rotation of staff.
Reminders
Strong protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in half the myth in McDonald's located near Times Square, where several local Democrats took part, in particular the municipal council member of the city of Yumanee Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling millions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators received support from other prominent Democrats in New York, for example from the candidate to mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support workers in the fast food sector so that they can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves".
As the New York Times newspaper described it, this has been the greatest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people, including not all of them, were employed in the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people in New York work.
It's still not clear whether this will use chips to cause massive movements.
"For now, squeezing the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of the increased reality, so popular among those affected by modern technologies, is finally generally perceived mainly through special gafas premiums.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Google conference, a model was shown in motion and later, in November, it was assumed that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the patent.
However, from a conversation with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group at Cambridge's Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was argued that for the scientists of this company, the gafs already belonged to a previous stage.
They attract the perspective of the handling of virtual objects in the air with the unopened hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We're dedicated to personal-computer interaction, but we're also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now mankind in its great mass has been trapped in the working phase with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes the touch with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and consider the cardiac changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in control by gestures.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, most of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design.
The world of information must be freed from our physical, physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those empty bags of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they appreciate it?
- Of course you can't be considered a panacea, it's about to resolve the issue of privacy, because it doesn't always want others to understand our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not on simple motions, but rather short.
In addition, the ghettos were captured, not by the camera of the device, but by a pulse that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pocket watch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this glass of soda?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- Or do you want to force users to adapt to what you can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have from modern cameras?
Do you need a resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the present generation can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps speed.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of matrix and depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects man-made interaction.
It would be very useful for me to work on an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact so that the tables per second be more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cams", one of which is actually the infrared radio transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visual range.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Maybe more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, instead, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- That's why I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented their faces to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, the gates are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, passing all the mouse by holding up a smart phone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass through the gates on the smart phone,
Gafas are very personal devices, in which it is their strength (private things you can only see), but also their weakness: an increased reality based on Gafas will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactical answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh interruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactical sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Register the tattoo perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really oriented to bring to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is found with a similar feeling that one feels if someone was slopping on the fingers of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also buttons for the mill that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to lie to the brain?
Do you make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space creates that goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like the gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as the giant globes.
For now, brain failure is not so easy, it still has to work for many years.
That is what makes work attractive with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front of, the art and culture.
In this list of the best, there are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements are far beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the extravagance artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red clothes from the bottom, where you can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Garden of Verano or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract the crowd, wherever they want to be shown.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophics of St. Petersburg, creating new myths.
Cyril Miller is a brilliant representative of the Vanguardism of St. Petersburg at the end of the 80s - the beginnings of the 90s.
In addition, he is a urban man whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the soundry inhabitants and rises up to all the state of spirits.
Recently, he took an organ in his hands and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he grew up to play such a difficult role because of his existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you in the red city and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray stirs up aggression and aggression of property nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my work was shown.
He told me it was my way.
Then the oil of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still incomprehensible.
He made me a friend of artists of the new island, with the successors who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new island was already over.
I'm in the theater for the clothes, the music of all generations, but not for the letters.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, he occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical club, a bohemio club, the house of the bohemia of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to the "Van Gogh Clock".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonograph, wearing adjusted pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was an encouragement to many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; basic education and training were received from us.
"D 137" gallery, the "Cub Griboyedov Club, are the rest of the Art Clinic.
There are our employees and Asian clients going there.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the title "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so I ended my graduation.
In these new times it is not easy to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to make popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something that makes sense in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which they clearly express the current and the event.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Payas."
The pajamas are a temporary category.
I used to be social, but now being like this is painful and terrifying.
But in the pajamas, everything is packed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through a comprehensive and mandatory change of clothing.
Now one goes on by the clothes, heading abroad, but not inside the person.
And, maybe that person doesn't have to hand him his hand or his face.
And the fool will be removed when he changes his clothes.
We've seen you in the role of urban organist.
How much better I have to be!
- Okay, but can the best trade art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be sloppy, sweet, touchy.
We are witness to the disintegration of cultures.
Before people grouped in mandas, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone's divided into micro-Communitys, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every hero of worship has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Sts Mikhailov's coming for thousands!
- They're gonna see him leave, there's the sex-social field.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, raised under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money just to paint paintings.
I'm in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from San Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a worker of culture.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were all right in another way, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in San Petersburg who could be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level that evaluate them correctly and open their way.
Now it's promoting subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's up with you, San Petersburg?
San Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for the art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infirm.
We have to make the art fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from San Petersburg.
Light up in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with people on board are looking for a rest planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in terms of infractions or on the same planet of rest?
I think there's a little where to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Marte," says researcher chief of the State Astronomic Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Marte are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
Only you can live in great heights or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of playing in space with the flower began to be addressed.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of orbital giants did not differ in any of the earth's variety.
Then came the creation of insects in the Orbita, small fruit bats, drosophilas.
In 1979 they were sent to the caverns of codonism to check how the embryo develops in conditions of pregnancy.
We got the result of a normal pollutant.
But then they start the problems.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, keep on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they didn't find support, the cops gave you back to the ass.
And after 10 hours in recent births, a total of instincts were given.
The cops didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the shame was that in four days they just died.
"And twice we were able to produce the dolls, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," comments Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the dolls in space.
The last time a biological "miniar" flew to orbit was 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, in biosatelite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were already sent to space with facts.
At first, there was nothing supernatural.
"This was exactly in the biosatelites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the earthquake, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, when losing their normal habit, simply cannot perform their sexual instincts.
Unlike small animals, however, man can at first.
The wise man has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional fund.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious that humanity has is the female organism.
Our plane flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," said the Veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze Air Force.
In June 1964, only after one year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave her a light to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We're few, the astronomers are told who after long flights all have been well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if it can be said more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," said the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, Russian hero Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for new ways to biotechnology, radiological protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator of the Cosmonauts Training Centre is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
Under zero flexibility, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates ingravitation.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is its natural element.
Small anfibio men seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside her mother in amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn birth monitor.
In summary, if ingravitation is a more natural state for a recent birth, it is necessary for women to be pregnant, the force of pregnancy.
In the inhalation of the abdominal muscles and the pelvis are described very quickly, the ability to expel the foetus is reduced.
Well, let's ignore that, trusting in the action of incentives for the birth.
You can, of course, give the light in a special camera, this will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
It is impossible to wear it with a special suit for training, such as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to make together, when we allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring the Earth to a completely inadequate person," the director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships are headed to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the "schvarc" system has not been given by the guilty politician
In the case of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is expensive.
This is how Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Office of Superma Control (NKUU) says in an interview for Aktualnö.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we need," he describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also lead to similar conclusions.
As an example of wrong practice, mention Peter Neczas's attitude toward the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "schvarc" system.
The first minister said recently that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the President of the Government can prevent the performance of the office which has the obligation to carry out such controls or to require obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control at the Congress of Members, you discussed the common project between the Czech and German teams, in which legislation on public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly is it?
It's a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
This is simple: European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised, following existing legislation in each country and then practice itself.
We have joined it all and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more stricter and more complete", however, the practical practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can actually contribute to this project? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing in the implementation of laws, reduction and improvement of borders, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting something suitable at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid such wealth and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of reducing the threshold of the bids, that is, we're going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is satisfied with so much "paper" that those who want to find errors on the system can do it more easily than if the limits remain as high as now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
With regard to offices such as the NKU, the Bundesrechungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, also with a college, is the only thing that is structured in a different way, but in principle both offices evolve simultaneously.
Competences are also to some extent similar, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the accounts courts are located even at this level. In this respect, however, it is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds administered by regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
That's sure not, but, again, I don't like to make this kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries we take as a model must deal with a large number of problems.
If it hadn't, I wouldn't have given them any benefit in cooperating with our office, wouldn't I?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean to your Office? Does it somehow show its incidence?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in control actions.
Since we do ex post checks, we have to count with a certain delay.
It is now noted in the process of preparing future controls: we have launched a new "non-economic risk detection" tool by which we have made almost 14,000 public bids, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection and similar process are corrected.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial, or is it, rather, an example for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the rule "is shaken" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to enforce the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal mistake, which does not have an impact on decision-making.
A system of this type will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road begins.
The first minister has recently stated that ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called swarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the swarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the first Minister of the Government may prevent the performance of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the legislation is quite strict as to how it should act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we need.
The roads offer ice plates, although most of them are translatable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads have ice and snow sheets.
Although most roads are transpired, in some cases caution must be exercised.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were translatable, but they presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature will rise and oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
The snow layer has been stopped in the region and in the low areas, the snow layer is finished.
On the other hand, the snow reaches almost 30 centimetres in the peaks of the Metal Mountains.
In some places, visibility was still poor because of the snow, according to information from the Regional Road Control Centre.
The rapid R6 road and the first-class road in the region are now transpired without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially in some points where the surface can be heated and rebalancing.
Also, all roads of the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also transparent.
However, in some of them there are still traces of ice and aprisoned snow.
There is a need to increase the focus on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
In some East Bohemia roads there is a danger of ice and higher areas and mountains may have formed a snow layer on the streets, reports on its pages the Direction of Roads and Roads.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger posed by ice plates, especially in areas higher than the Pardubice region.
It can be produced in the immediate stages of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitiv or Vysokého Mýta, and especially in the second and third categories.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Switzerland have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the streets of the mountains of Krkonoše in Orlické hory.
There is a cloud layer recorded in the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of the East Bohemia, the sky will be today between disintegrated and partially clouded, without precipitation.
The temperatures will generally oscillate between three low zeros and a positive degree, resulting in a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transparent today in the morning, although caution will need to be exercised and time will need to be adjusted.
In the first hours of the morning, temperatures will be around three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the next down of the temperatures, some roads could also be covered by ice.
In some places drivers will meet with snow, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is learned from the Regional Road Operations Control Centre.
The D5 highway is almost accessible without restrictions, although it is recommended to take care, especially on the route between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and without ice.
In the Pilsen and Tachov border road area with Germany there may be wires with ice plates.
The roads of the second and third categories are wet, so in this case it is also warned of wires with steel plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less-transmitted roads in the area of Sumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers headed to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partial snow.
After the chemical treatment, it was still snowed at the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský Kríž.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; in the Shumper road they gathered about three centimetres of snow, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transparent without restrictions.
"In the higher areas of the Shuuper road, there are snow remaining.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will be found with nine medium-distance gear towards Jeseník," a driver in the Čumper road administration has confirmed today.
On the ground and in the night they also came to Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now dislocated and moved.
In the Olomouc road the roads are transpired without restrictions, the drivers in Šternberská should drive cautiously in the forest roads, where the roads continue to be wet.
Region of Ustí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The operators of the roads in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different ways at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where he has snowed or helmed, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ustí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain in the bed. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the south of the central Czech city, there are no problems and roads, generally dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the memory.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surrounding area of Štétí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to fall and the sky will be exhausted and there will be ice during the night.
The General Roads have announced adverse conditions in road I/13, on the border between the Ustí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month, the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmed news that we like to catch up with.
At The Tap Tap music group we prefer to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to put the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organized a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It's a state benefit act we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential at the end of the May calendar announced for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the previous day, on 20 December at 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time that ends May's calendar on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to you?
At first it was my idea, then we were leaving the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
At the end of the May calendar we have also created a single collection of articles: boots, shirts, bags and originals against the end of the world that can be obtained at www.e-tap.cz, another form of support.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sang the so-called demon against the end of the world, which is entitled "The End of the World, Canceled".
Currently it's very popular on YouTube, can you hear the beneficial concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be the last, well, whenever everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
Immunos will be connected at the same time thanks to the special retransmission on the Czech TV.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interprets Jesus' protagonist role in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
We are making every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in them and have fun working with us.
To what will money be spent in concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational centre without barriers Study, which we end up in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkóv institution.
The students of the Jedličkóv school receive regular visits from teachers who perform interesting and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and we make an effort to do so.
In the framework of the completion of the work in Jedličkův institution, there will be an independent building to which we will be transferred by this project.
Various groups and interpreters are active in each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they act in Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratrapere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other "expective action" similar in the future?
In May we will take action for the first time at the Pražské annual festival, so we will certainly prepare here an attractive program with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and to me, personally, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted by example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How are the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as hard as it might look like the first view.
There are five members in electric wheels chair, the chairs must travel to the equipment compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, we have been well organized so far. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which is not surprising to me.
Even in Moscow, where we returned a little ago, everything came out without problems.
With foreign exits you can compare the different attitudes of society towards disabled persons and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that there is a lot of road to travel in this area.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still no time for a person to move alone through the city centre in an electric wheel chair.
Something as current as it is, for example, prefering someone in a wheelchair in the elevator, it's not there.
As a result, a civil association has been established that seeks to intimidate the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what areas must we take the example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects to which we go back...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on those directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with severe disabilities move to their public account and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap let's go a little ahead!
A respected or without barriers society is a thing, but when it comes to the moment when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers start to change everything.
So far, there are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led them to form the group in 1998?
I entered as a educator in the Jedličkóv institution, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I'm playing, among others, the saxofon, founded a amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderater Ládăa Angelovic says, we were a few of the hands (riss).
However, the popularity has not reached the last few years, do I err?
It is true that it has helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
With the help of the European Union, we can also provide quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Do you intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there, which could be done differently.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that all the new is welcomed with caution and soon enough time to accept it.
There are a few strange things, but I'm afraid to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not left to suffer and those to whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, of course, on the condition that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then, it's not just a step for them, but for the whole society.
Did it help the fact that you're a demanding boss, how do many people describe him?
If we want to do a quality job, we have to be strict in many aspects and require some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they realize that they have to spend two days trying, going to the preparatory test and spending a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Just one: Ládía Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and out, they can't be avoided.
Whoever has the will and gains will always find the open doors
It will be the day before the world's end, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fleda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will take part in 12 groups and other music from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconferencing to sing the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance the multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without barriers STUDEO in the Jedličkóv Institute of Prague, whose cost is up to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free access to the option of sale in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as a 12th member of the ESA. It is the second member country of the ESA of the former Eastern Europe block, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and has participated in the Agency's project committee for the following years.
However, the path of Poland to the cosmos began a long time ago.
Polish enthusiasts have already dedicated themselves to flights to space before World War II, although their work has not always been understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at Warsaw's astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the independent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnaul-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a cosmonautist, known all over the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925, a train was built in Poland that was to be provided by a driver.
Unfortunately, we do not know who was the author of the proposal and we do not know the details of the project.
It is not clear whether the cohete should be used for the start of the dress or for its brake.
The information on this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the day.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to be dedicated to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslawem Wolfek and Professor Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of the practice tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 he appeared in the specialized press on the prototype of a photo-electronic chassis missile designed by engineer Rohozinski and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powitrnzna and rakietobomba Lottnicza", by author Lelaya-Krzywoblockki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczaswow Committee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all mission techniques for military use and coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Tovarzystwo Astronautique).
The November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem refers first to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that space research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Association of Astronautics (PTA) had sought to form part of the International Federation of Astronauts (founded in 1951) and in October of that year the PTA has become a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronauts.
He completed this charge until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has participated significantly in the development of the RM probe (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has been a success and has become the first Polish cohete in which scientific research has been carried out.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The cohete had a length of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm long and not reached 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and air tests of RM-2 cohetes were launched in the Blüdów desert in the summer of 1959.
The average catch was 1.4 meters and weighed about 11,5 kg.
Another type of developmental cohete was to be a real scientific study. The RM-34 cohete was to have a backup of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, the work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM cohetes was the Meteor-1 cohete, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed to hold two steps, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from the space available to scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A cohete, the volume space was 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum support in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 county was developed in the Air Institute, whose first aircraft tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 cohete had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercom month after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional judge suspended the social work law.
The resolution raised an urgent debate in society.
Since then it will be interesting to consider the existing problem from a broader point of view.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, such as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and lower regulatory competence.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict.
The cause is at the beginning of free trade and the free and limited movement of private capital, along with the uninterrupted financial speculation.
The effect of large differences on labour costs (from wages) results in economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to cut distances and for that "proposes a low price" of the competitor with the aim of making most of the market and thus increasing its margin of profits.
At a large scale, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying more cheap or well disappearing there. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the labour price, compared with other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and therefore is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social costs of the state are growing necessarily.
All this situation contributes to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs by paying taxes and compensation for the economic and social damages they have caused in their interest to profit.
The situation is universally known and it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The low slumpable practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which Governments of those countries are obliged to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments have private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The objective is to force the public to accept the right to private capital, especially in respect of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, by the restricted right of workers to labour rights.
The result is an increasing poverty together with increasing the gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food supplies in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of aid is already up to a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, a very common case arises: people employed with a pay so low that the state must pay the rest to achieve the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the German Federal Parliament's assistant employees was published.
The measures to save practically all the states of the south of the EU are undoubtedly leading to the same situation: people, forced by an ambitious decline in their social level, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or to live with a poor wage within the boundaries of society, hoping that one day they will reach the private capital country.
Do you need to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
The liberal theories and media insist that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to its failure.
The private capital depends on the fact that the state should not intervene in the economy by introducing itself into control.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence itself in the political process and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clear.
The evidence is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is an unexpected situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favor, in a legislation that is practically reprovable in all parts but not criminal.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, without financial means, are responsible for drafting laws to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of draft law was adopted after the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
Thus, all power does not extend to the people, as it is announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but to the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are rapidly in a situation like that described by the Appians in their work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state took time to de-integrate and administrations took care of the force."
Instead of sovereigns, benefits obtained illegally and help to finance stones or swords.
Sodom and corruption were spread without hindrance, and people flocked to the urns with an earlier vote"... "there were no people with a desire for a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consensus" ... "It began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man"... Although Appianos thought in Pompey, Caesar took power and transformed democracy forever into autocracies.
The conclusion, in the same way as in ancient times, is that the current society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital cannot, in its essence, understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same, then, as a decade of the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it deeply.
The causes of the rise in fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought for the unfavourable liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, such as a defined break, pending the next attack.
The fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as well as what we know in the past and the most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not long enough.
Under the pressure of economic competence, at both the international and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the cave laboratory.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his Fragile song and whose strebilized prayer "Let's do not forget how frugile we are" (we don't forget the frugile we are).
"If my children didn't want war, there wouldn't be anyone" Guttel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death bed in 1849.
After the last oil of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have always been different reactions.
One side of Israel argues in favour of the right to self-defence and facilitates Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and declares racism by the state of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and strikes Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. In the end and in the end, the citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to provide readers with a view behind the screen, a view to discover who is benefiting from the tensions that have been raised for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in a small land area of the Middle East.
Some of my views are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, on which or what group of people is the main proponent of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of struggle by power is in the first line.
At any time we can find an Alejandro Magno or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who guided their steps in an autonomous manner or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and power that this involves has not been achieved in one generation alone.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't know): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, would cover their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after Iraq's attack there were 5, after only four of them, but Russia has submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschild Bank, beginning during the War of the Section to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
JFK started to print money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was arrested in 1936 after he wanted to ask the FED for the release of the big economic crisis in 1929.
His zeal for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the Albert Pike mason, concocted with degree 33.
The first war was marked as the goal of eradicating the great monarchy throughout Europe; the second would eliminate colonial sovereignty, especially in Britain, and the third would be to reduce the population of the land between the middle and the millions (a similar number of slaves for their well-being and well-being and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a project for similar solutions) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method used by the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis degradation and the subsequent provision of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, errors, and always lead to an improvement in the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like the year 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful killing of the heir to the Austrian-Hungary throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, Russia was destroyed by the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended in a sudden and unjustifiable manner from a military and economic point of view, the capitalization of Germany (wars to end with Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent decline of the great power of Central Europe, the East-Hungary Empire.
In order to prepare the land of the Second World War, banks and politicians were allowed to create, in a comprehensive manner, a conflict situation due to the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, which created the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the weakened masses. Subsequently, they were subjected to the Germans with the use of the Führer solution, which was sufficiently strong and simple and pointed to guilt, and then built a Checoslovakia composed of several nations with a strong German minority that should represent and represent the function of the fifth column, which called for and caused the establishment of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that promoted the formation of a Jewish state, preferring to the region of ancient Judah with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above set out the foundations for the massive Jewish immigration in Palestine and initiated the first conflicts with the Arab population of the area.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
It was the Second World War: it was difficult to know whether Hitler drew too much from what the international banks had taken in principle or whether everything he had done was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the best conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in global society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly, as the war repairs imposed on Germany led the way towards World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel, the focus was created for a third war.
If international banks were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the first line of war, now with the Arab population or, in general, Muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is an enormous laboratory, a soldiering machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also at the international level. Let us take as an example how the sympathetic and detractive people of Israel divide.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where will injustice cause injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at first it was the code of some individuals and their fate by world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its mandaters, because, as is true in our country, international banks only present their candidates in the elections.
Israel's current President B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist policy, loyal to international banks, which makes every effort to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we were to take into account Iran's control of Ormuz's darkness, where 20 per cent of the world's total oil is spent (the navigation corridor has only two thousand tons of fuel), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a number of people who are part of well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual has a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And it is binding for all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: who has two front fingers, which sum up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo Film: If it's rough, call me Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamic students attended the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
Its free position was to be replaced by the devastating Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlévi, who, after the revolution, fled to the U.S., a country that had been sponsoring its regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: drawing the Shah on the border could not be allowed, since, if it did, jeopardise the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the free position of the regents in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within its scope.
It was a hit on the U.S. prestige, which was later intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Government of Algeria.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck is a episode of this story, which has gained little success for America.
Just before handling the package, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated periple, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassies.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, was able to get them out of Iran, to help them find an exciting story: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the location in the country for the circulation of a fiction science superproduction.
Gender Combination
The plan that led the expert to "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the lie seem true, it was written on the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, and the fictitious production society had even a real waste.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film was made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a single combination of several generations.
On the one hand, a realistic political triller; on the other, a "caper movie", the story of an episode that came out well, a lie (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film we combine the states of enthusiasm. We find well documented sequences of Tehran. In the credit sequence there are emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were plasmated in the same way in the film; there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a much lighter, marked by irony and a mild exaggeration.
In addition, scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions: brought men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, at the offices' passports, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has been able to resume his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been subjected to bubbles, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the blank of ironic comments.
Argo is its third long-term, after "Adiós Little, Adiós" (2007) and the triller "The Town. City of Ladrons" (2001).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which the action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teher will be "red" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film have a place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introduction sequence of the package is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that at the same time conveys the emotion of the misunderstanding and the lack of forecast that arises when, in some places, history gives a step forward.
Affleck and his colleagues have a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the taxing team at Tehran base).
Too much action in too many locations
The director had to accept the fact that an explanation of history does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it is well arranged. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here it doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis takes place in Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America, and the uninterrupted search after its track becomes a joke).
Argo's flak is the decontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very grateful role as Hollywood's collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, not much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little dramatic trace, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, evaluate its performance and the retro-style of a thriller who's in the '70s.
But if it breaks down, that's gonna be hard.
As the evolution of a real story and as evidence of the extremes that may be the notions of the omnipresentity and omsity of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for global inflation, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which provides an annual survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the EU's most absurd regulation or ideas".
"If it happened to us after the last event, the EU is planning to adopt a 40 percent share of women in positions of leadership in large European companies," explained Pravo Patrick Nacher, the director of the survey.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women is among the absurdities mentioned.
To date, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they are objectively at a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
Among the EU's conflicting regulations, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the short-term directive on the size of the gallins, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The effective prohibition of using the term "mantequill de untar" or the withdrawal of the classical bomb of trade has been criticized.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 cm.
The Union apparatus often takes this type of decision under the pressure of one or more commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, including with the threat of veto, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that more quality platinums should have a length of at least 14 cm in the EU and could not present "normal curves".
The European Commission was defending itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonise non-conformity of national standards until the date, which would only make them commercialized.
The rules which refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive leads to food waste.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU requirement of last year, which in the inflexible worlds that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to infect them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was referring here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, the globe is the main cause of children's death by asphyxiation.
There is also a similar restriction on the use of pesticides by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious events are even born in our country
Similarly absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia; in order not to harm Greece's sensitivity, FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia) must be spoken of.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, appointed the investigation, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the requirement of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for conservation purposes, which posed a threat to many of them.
The investigators were also interested in paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application of subsidies.
This kind of idea did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're disappointed at the fact that we don't have a sea.
In October 2004, the Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CHSSD) said: "We ask the European Union for compensation."
He argued with the fact that very cereals were produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stocks and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from the maritime ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was willing to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant for a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, directed by Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often clear of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts, and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve better, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collapse of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved budgetary negotiations.
The Czechs are also touched by the sensitive fiber, as in other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to name their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these wars.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc claim, but had to change its name to the national Ron, whose tradition in our country is remanded in the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemak".
Only products produced from the distilled sugar can be named round, but not those made from sugar stoppers.
The official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with well-known fetish and gorgonsols around the world, the German city mazapan Lübeck or the town of Parma, is already found for example by the galleries of Karlovy Vary, the map of Pohorèlice and Třébonón, and also the variety of Žatec lupupu.
As the EU's protected seas, they may be proud of the Pardubice Pan and the Horíce Barquills in Podkrknoše.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an affidavit, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how have you been presented to the presidential election?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it was all right in our country, then I wouldn't present my application.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in our country in the last 20 years, how the thieves remain imputable, the taxes and the age of jubilation are increasing.
I didn't have any ambitions to be political.
When I see something that I don't like, I try to give you a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidate is independent, the only possibility I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter he has been on his way to the presidency.
Aren't you giving the support to those people who voted for it?
I have always said that my application to the presidency depends on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I made it clear that if I had left the elected senator, I would have submitted my application to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can actually make my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of television, but that we blame anyone who wants to start a change.
To this you are taken into account the means of communication, which discourage you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
I'm saying I've given journalists what I've been counseling Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about his ideas.
The presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibility of politicians and the statement of property over twenty million is presented.
To do that, you have to change the law.
As President, he does not have this competence and only the Senate in its entirety can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have become part of a pressure group so that the leadership office is recognized as self-employed work, and we have been able to do so.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether right or left, it is rejected for purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary groups.
Without enquiries or party doctrines, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to apply it.
Is there a man on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It doesn't matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is we're moving forward.
I don't care if anyone's right or left, I want to join people.
I always support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
It makes a joke when it's said that you're a populist.
But you're not showing him what he's saying?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And try to get close to them.
There will be people who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak already work in the world or known experts speak of them.
But without Parliament's support, it is only granted.
And with that, you can't survive long-term politics.
Or do you believe that if you address and talk to people, you will, for example, gain a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and to try to get them out of my way.
If he had been elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a direct television transmission that would require the leaders of parliamentarian parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, possibly, they should communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that indicates disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
Let us take the President's direct election, which has been a success of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just an affidavit, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals, I'm trying to find allies.
I just started politics and tried to get the most possible support for my programme.
I'm trying to get things out myself, but if it doesn't work well, within six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of known personalities, so they will best be encouraged to present their application to the Senate.
I saw Radim Jancura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, I have at least supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who shed light on the frauds with light heating oil.
I was presenting myself from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not attend the meetings and those who did so voted to the representatives of the institution.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or Governors.
Are you considering forming your own game?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the incapacitated past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have money?
Speaking of property declarations, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land worth 25 million, a estimated 10 million, another eight million square feet, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Superb Skoda valued in a million, and I have a couple of millions in the account.
Of course, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was jealous of women, and at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Does Aston Martin conduct, his property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say he wants to change the Republic, but he doesn't want to put too much money on his part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to confess?
In the campaign I've already put 2.5 million.
The fact that you don't have any sponsors shows that there's not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with my wallet money.
The costs of the campaign are essentially what I will receive in terms of Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 monthly crowns.
If I only wanted to earn money, then I wouldn't be presented as a candidate.
So you'll continue with your business activity to live?
Didn't he say before he left this activity?
This has nothing to do with a bigger salary.
As I have promised, I have left some of my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring.
People wanted it to be the Samaritan who saved the Republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How often does it take to win monthly as a entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If he was president, then he would leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that real adventures are not just in the head - in the example of Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "book store" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it's a futureist look, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a crossing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, TI technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
No one gets into those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city located at the gates of Rotterdam that deserves only a visit, holds the doubt of being raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people presents the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven phytosanitary points that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated thumbnails of armed hormicone.
The success of the educational offender was limited.
And that was how political officials decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: I had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar charts and responsible for building fun at the pair as cynics, took the subject with his usual seriousness and compared the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked around and gathered mended, Maas proceeded to pick up the books by size by forming a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: "Dear lovers:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, called 'Boekenberg'.
Nine years later, the amount of EUR 30 million rose to the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with underground parking, supermarket, mail office and a couple of housing and housing buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also named "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a post-modern Petonal area and an incredible alliance made after which white façade one would have a better focus on milk, now with a modern architecture work.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in her history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it's a book paradise under a basket.
Well, it's true that there's an elevator that transports us right at the center of this mountain peak, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but they prefer to base themselves with their topography every step of their climb up.
The fully acrystalized interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the ground of the collected ladrill, and the elegant words support the public condition of the library in an unambiguous manner.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you save the view, you can see the banks of the park, the dogs and the children and girls playing football.
And for all sides books, books and more books.
"Normarily the book stanzas are available along the façade and a huge dark room is opened in the center that is generally used to be something uncomfortable and personal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put shoes on the classic space configuration and remove the reading area inside the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: the offices, the Internet library, the academia club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the center.
Special mention is worth the black stars that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and walling at the same time.
The view, the tattoo and the elephant are strange.
Even the more civil engineers and architects of the day cut their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, in a fresh agricultural exploitation, we meet with the appropriate sub-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the winters and in the valleys of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of dry millimetres of thickness has been used as a basis for subsidizing the roots of crops.
It's a cheap and efficient material.
This fabric lasts for two stations and then it fades away.
For the library, this fabric was first taken in such quantities until it reached a square foot [4 cm] thick.
With heat and pressure, the called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogenous and resistant material that smells a new car mix and sports shoes.
After 105 injuries, they reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this road, almost 500 metres around the mountain waits for the reward: from the café there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy beautiful Dutch crochets and its fig trees planted in huge machetes.
These create a pleasant environment for the pair that maintains the appropriate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Grants for a new soul
"Although you would like to believe it given its large acrylic surfaces, this building is a copy project with respect to the environment," Trouborst says.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the most sunny days the sun shines within a few hours.
The huge wood circles located across the surface at the crystal factory serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest is something of the automatic Persians.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker of the Information Technologies sector, has already been reluctant to put the foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies as the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "famous soul".
The reason is that, because of the inaugration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the citizens of the city were invited to give a book to their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical holes of a library that still does not match its complete file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept's been broken.
The stars are filled.
"There's nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection to this building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the library.
Even though he's just there to admire.
In this way, the MVRDV study has succeeded in this royal discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young man and the guilty one who may be.
Finally, a point of departure to conform to your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has abstained from the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a very dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it would vote against the proposal to grant the status of the observer State of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally withdrew.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support North America's position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also withdrew when it was about to establish a flight ban zone.
This has been finally declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international themes are being played?
Yeah, that's right.
This is due to the fact that at these times its foreign policy is being redirected, leaving behind a leading policy, so to say, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
As a result, the Germans are in an encrusted state.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they're still trying to play what their role is, but they've already started the way towards an external "normal" policy.
A similar foreign policy to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions other than those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that Germany's foreign policy has a strong motivation for economic policy, i.e. its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the United Nations vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it should be careful not to turn away from the Arab public opinion or from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give you so much importance because it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany lost its relationship with the United States by refusing to vote in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, German poetry is a great deal of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a dramatic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
It may be that Germany has managed to grow a certain respect.
Finally, all of this has done nothing but to prove that it is a country that takes seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Are there discrepancies between the United States and many European nations?
These discrepancies have always existed due to the US internal policy.
I believe that the Government of Obama has a strong understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position publicly.
I believe that the true discrepancy of opinions does not really have the confusion attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for anything excited about the policy it is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations between Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogenous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the ability to form part of a superior entity, but they must move things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in order to force Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, it is already simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous subject.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Do you see Germany itself in the role of an important international actor? Do you really want Germany to assume a protagonist role?
Or maybe he's still finding it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been accustomed to it, it has always been a bit uncomfortable and, for some reason, it continues to play a more important role in the country.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany puts itself as a major actor, certain anti-German feelings are eliminated.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem, and no one wants to be around the enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in European policy is increasing, but the EU is not currently covering this empty space, so who is left?
Germans will not be left with any more remedy than to assume a more protagonist role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable, or if it turns them into even more impotence people, it's life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly converted into Chinese brands
Armani is a well-known global brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name a name officially registered in China is hidden but has nothing to do with original companies.
However, this pleasure of protection while the real eponymous do not make a claim.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them the reason.
"To foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the buffer Taylor Wessing specialized in violations of protection rights in the Middle East.
A new case comes to my table every week.
Imitators simply add a few letters to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way as did Puma sports goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he keeps seats from the Beijing Mark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also served as the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese are global champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well-known.
In large cities there are large stocks of several plants devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he contends against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to obtain a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or a accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
Which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful for business, you have to fight it," asks Pattloch.
"The mark makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and the procedural costs of the affected sectors are million, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15,000 million per year in China, the third market for luxury products is in size and is growing at a higher rate.
However, to achieve the cancellation of registrations of suspicious legality in the trademark register is complicated and also much money.
Process can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had passed as long as the name of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the applicant has a bad luck, maybe he even has to pay money to the plaintiff because the process has damaged its brand in China," Pattloch says.
This is sometimes the law of the forest.
Some of the best-known cases have to be seen with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a battle against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the company that had been absorbed recently by the German bomber Putzmeister.
That's why Chinese today can continue to use a very similar symbol to Mercedes's star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that reminded BMW of a great deal; the matter was transferred to the courts and Geely had to change it.
The clothes manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a cocodile looking at the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO Mark Office in Beijing recognizes that difficulties have been encountered in 2010 due to lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of labour emergency returned to normal".
In this way, the number of untraited complaints has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending for resolution.
To deal with this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of brands, almost one third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and meant that China would lead the list of new registrations worldwide for a decade consecutively, according to the trade mark office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, the figure that rises to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been filled in the right.
In other words, this means that, on average, each registration costs 1,280 yuans or 160 euros.
Working against this costs a lot of money, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has fought in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the sampler has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the appellants are not protected," said Hanno Wentzler, President and Counsellor of the Delegation of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Mark Office also estimated the resource of municipalities.
In both of the following instances, Freudenberg has been justified, but the opposite party is still fighting.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the Supreme Court of Justice, where the resolution remains pending.
Wentzler is confident that he is able to resolve the question in favour and commend the professionality of the courts.
However, it also claims that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review expeditions from up to a hundred years of age in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the party a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it did not succeed.
"This shows how much we care about it," says Wentzler.
The dangers posed in the Middle East threaten even to affect Europe,
In particular, if imitations are guaranteed there rights on unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
In time the group left this commercial area, however, it was able to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and counsel Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious at the time of business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on marking rights, but what must be done is "to register in China as well as everything that can be protected," as Wentzler points out.
On the contrary, the theme can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg would lose the last chance of his own battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights on his own behalf, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would get us out of the market.
World Day of the Fight Against AIDS: dancing, singing, helping
Heidelberg tries the heart Impongui and Switzerland rejoices in AIDS orphans
The history of a link can exceed much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts by the ball: cowboy boots, ballast shoes, taco shoes and mocasins are looking for the compass on the park floor, and they quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to slowly raise the voices of the singers (control, bottom, tenor and soprano), putting themselves in the mood, sneezing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of his castles by trying to order with his powerful and soft gestures.
It's Monday morning and in the music room of Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute, the Imbungui heart is trying a new song.
Fifty singers have also come from 23 to 69 years of age from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the heart has a different text and also in a known foreign language only: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme worldwide contains about 34 million people infected by the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already seropositive.
The Association Voices for Africa has found in Germany fathers for 180 HIV orphans from the people of Esitjeni.
Seven of them attend secondary school.
For EUR 15 or 20 per month, you can join a child.
This contribution will cover the school's matrix, the uniform and ensure a hot food every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbungui means "historics" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can talk with fluids in this divided language, but sing yourself they know.
For ten years this choir has been trying songs in this soft foreign language that are sometimes able to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres straight from Heidelberg, in the north of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni, which depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple shelves of bar and bed, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have been infected with AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the higher AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see with good eyes the circulation, a practice that has been shown to be reduced to half the risk of infection.
More than 40 per cent of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something more than thirty years has become a habit.
During a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, the heart discovered this well-known population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets that lost not only the protection of their parents but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more short-lived.
In principle, it was only the special commitment of a few little people that would make it possible for a child to go out of school and enjoy a hot meal every day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association that has since been professionally employed by AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial origin ETS are syphilis, clamidia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral origin ETS are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
The leaves and branches are between the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main impact groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more frequent in men who maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact with men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are clamide, tricomone infections, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hong) and gonorre.
The incidence of HIV among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are reported in this group.
Among young people, claramide infections are much more common than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1.697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has remained a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
It is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venous disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary disorders, flu, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or urticaria.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore do not detect them.
How can one be protected?
Conservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer protection to a hundred per cent.
Some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases may also be transmitted through susceptibility and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regularly submitting to medical examinations, especially if they change with the frequency of sexual intercourse.
If they are temporarily diagnosed, most of the ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any subsequent consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, ultimately but not least, of the fees that cover the heart for their actions throughout Germany, they are able to earn enough money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," noted proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In Zodwa Dlamin's own village, a safe woman herself and with leadership powers manages the money sent from Germany.
It is concerned that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogogos", as it is called for older women in gold, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof where they live and care that children go to school every day and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under Khanyyle's protection, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 pregnant children, realizes a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a school of customs, has built two galleys and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the people have been subjected to a HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is all over the country, it is not often mentioned openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because she has to look at sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his busy and full way of life.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless times that travel across the country on the one hand and take it to where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner can be obtained free of charge, but these are only used.
It is another culture, here they only accept the contact skin against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, Imbungui Coro travels every two or three years to South Africa by singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition brings me not only an excellent environment and great joy, but also has managed to start a couple of tears to someone other than the Arab border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the missing children.
Although this small population appears only on the maps, in the valley of the Ezullo River is well known.
"Draw near Esitjeni, there shines light," the people of the place say.
And after passing the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the test rooms on the Bergheimer street filled with singers marking the step, one is aware that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurio
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice in Mercurio.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the presence of ice in Mercurio.
Despite being treated from the nearest planet to the sun, there are also hot water, as well as three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently located in the shadow.
It seems that it has at least 30 cm and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is likely to come from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that were shot at Mercurio on its day.
No one relates the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the researcher chief of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees Fahrenheit [426 ° C].
However, findings could help explain how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
In a completely undisclosed way for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, the probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are devoted to exploring the depths of the universe.
Once they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers at Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that conform to our solar system, in addition to the planet enno Ceres.
Like Pluton, which rotates around the sun right behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomy Union in 2006 Ceres is no planet.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "born stars".
This region of star formation, called a little romantic by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Caspian constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This resonated picture of an out-of-state star was taken by NASA Telescope Spitzer.
The Donut ring is made up of the material the star digs in its extinction process.
In the enormous Nebulousa Trifida, 5,400 years light from the Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA Telescope Spitzer took this picture from the Galactic Star Training Area.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Brothers", are an object visible to a simple view in the night sky.
However, with telescopes, colors can be better appreciated.
The Nebulousa of the Hélice appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrared.
It is located at 700 years of light from the Acuario constellation.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has validated North America's surplus.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image leads to a colourful spectacle.
This star in ancient times could be captured in all its splendour for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated is still one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without leaving trace 4,500 million years ago.
One of the largest and most clean photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Galaxy of Remolino.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located thousands of years of light in the constellation of Sagitario.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (trifidus divided into three), since some dark lines of dust divide the hearts of this stellar training area into three lobulas.
In the constellation of Ofiuc, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic character: 400 million years of Earth's light the kernels of two galaxies in the process of fusion are moved one to the other to end by ringing irremediablely.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the name of Australian Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the Cefeo constellation.
The nebula located at 1,400 years of light is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographics made by different telescopes.
It displays a ring of black needles located at 430 million years of light from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the spiral galaxy of the largest size UGC 1810.
In this nebulas is the group of the most brilliant young stars of our Vía Láctea.
This sterilization area constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also constantly new stars, up to 5,000 years of light from the Earth.
In this so bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galileo used it one year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes has not stopped growing, and the images they offer us are increasingly deep.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest of the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Great Binocular Telescope is set up.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The unconventional of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed height angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed height angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equivalent to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radiotelescope (Port Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI for its signals in English) can help any person who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Australian European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also light the average infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also receive the name E-ELT (European Extreme Large Telescope or European Extreme Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Up to 2018 it is not expected to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the world's largest.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a 30-metre mirror diameter.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, space telescope Kepler has been looking for extra-sole planets, especially those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission 1,235 candidates have been located on the planet.
The picture shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched to space on the side of a Ariane 5-2018 cohete.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Investigators are based on the fact that there is also ice in the South Pole of Mercurio.
However, there are no compelling evidence, since the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first orbiting Mercurio, scientists are now sure that it is.

A search for eggs in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The trip by the mountainous region of Talysh could qualify as rescue and Romantic.
The minibus makes great progress through the sinuous road that passes along the forest hills, rivers of great caudadal and the simple houses of local farmers.
It's all green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Sea.
However, we are located in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here are the "talyshi" people who are not very well known, except that they perfectly dominate Persia and Assyria and that they are very distant.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town assumes a architecture perhaps too masculinally designed in the Soviet era and that it does not seem to fit everything in such a mountainous landscape.
European tourists only arrive here because the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban kernels, they need eight hours because the road is of one sense.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspio Sea has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what must be needed to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May due to the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the festival of the oldest people in the world," notes Fatulayeva.
It's about the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here you can document the life of eight dozen Thais from the place they have over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to an image in white and black.
This is my grandmother, who lived 120 years.
A son died at the age of 136
However, the indisputable star of the museum is the shepherd of the sheep Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth party that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Muslims is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. It seems that he still had time to produce a daughter at 136 years of age.
So has Şirali Müslümov been wrong in his age in a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan, there are also very advanced older people," says Scholz, "including in Cerdenja there are many older men."
Due to lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence on age; at least when there is no civil record.
All day empty filled with detachment
It is a fact that, surprisingly, residents of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many older people live here in the south?
The tourist guide, Farid Mugimzadeh, explains that it is of the special species of Thais.
The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the rich food in the calories of the talyshi, which worship the meat, the bread and, above all, the lactic products and many of which drink a glass of dried butter daily, be so healthy.
Or perhaps the natural way of life that holds young people? In Cangemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, he is relatively young for what he is used to by these Latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical wood house throughout the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves in an indistinct way a huge mantechilla chain.
Eight people lived under a roof, among them one of the children and one of Mirzayeva's daughter, both became grandmothers long ago.
They also play from one side to the other of two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical vessels in a bombed way.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the cover conceals two long pieces of dark red hair that her son discovers us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept his color.
"I've never used a bell," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced in his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and chisantes.
I've never been to buy a supermarket all my life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-war period of World War II.
However, everything came back to its fall when the "left father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This type of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an adult woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the religion taught in the parental form of the nation, which leads its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in power until 2003, the moment the witness delivered to his son Ilham.
At least Azerbaijan's biggest people don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva covers 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, a number with which you can live well in view of the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son-in-law is right: "In our culture the adults are very respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to keep you alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The huge division in which the country is taken out of the country is demonstrated by the manifestations of the manifestations of mutual rivalry between themselves in Cairo.
The future constitution, with the share as a basis, is very controversial.
Egypt's president did not escape from patentism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was directed to all the people, especially to Christian concepts, liberals, illustrated Muslims and secularists.
All of them, submitted without remedy until now in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile because of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the constitutional court's competencies and expand his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctor's title given by the University of South California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive yourself of your power in court?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been approved by an assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said that the case-law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean of "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this false formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that appeared, to impose a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least one new article suggested: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the University of Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
It has no reason to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that would, in fact, result in the incompatibility of the judiciary.
A large part of the constitution's eraser is open to interpretation
The problem is also that they intend to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to impose a severe repression on the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the clearer states, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
It is such a vague formulation in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Of course it's nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, he refuses to offend or insult Prophet Mohammed and his allies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it must be punished.
The same question is the formulation that prohibits "infecting people"
Is it enough to charge the president or a check on a letter?
The question of interpretation, such as many other things in the wilderness that have been presented to Mursi for her signature, and that, according to her words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"The revolution has returned."
Weeks ago the opposition was closing lines against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at the Tahrir Square in the Cario and swore to make the Act fail before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we are going to win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who takes the third place on the list of presidential elections.
The Nobel la Paz and director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the founder of the constitution should be "in the bottom of the dust of history".
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state war against democracy".
"When the referendum is called, we will go to his palace and we will destroy it," said oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been exposed," was quoted in the Egyptian media to political oppositioner Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so they would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifaction; for if not in the Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of El Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and lashes took part in the same cry: "The people require the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "clean the country", while they proclaimed, "The Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic square Tahrir, where everything began, would have caused a similar situation in a civil war.
It is obvious that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk anything like that.
The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the author of the constitution and the supporters of the same would have expressed their views high and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide what direction the country should follow.
In this regard, it seems that the Muslim wiper has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he will share his ideology, but because for him Human Rights are invisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," laments a conversation with the newspaper "Well am Sontag".
The expansion of Mursi's competencies to the State's three powers led to the appointment of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of democratic play and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"In place of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolished," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
It is also felt abandoned by the international community, which is observing the ideological struggle that is taking place at the sources of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could go back against you.
A exhibiter at Tahrir Square warns: "You're thinking of a monster you can't control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: is the world's worst fishing?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has anything to do with its awareness of a highly evil fishing?
Take a lot of overcrowded cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a dirty and wet football mountain.
Put him there for a week.
You can then smell the paralysing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's quays.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is called in a room that stops shutting in water for a while, depending on the bad guy you prefer, for a year.
As it gets dark and it gets colder, the Norwegians are too proud of a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food of the most, so to say, a causative.
"It's like rough and then it's drinking a glass of water from a trail," says Havard Halvarsen, a bomber of the city that is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On all sides, we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking a great deal of drinking.
"Some people like water more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some slices.
If you can avoid passing it close to the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different to a part of a sushi that has walked a few kilometers in a bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which Norway's azotabad poverty, and in which, before it existed, the fish was stored during the autumn in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in full winter, when it is well fermented, it is removed and, of course, with the negative feelings due to alcohol, it eats.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they primarily emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a full system of social services.
A stream of residents of Sweden, the old rival and even makes little more rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, an essential part, although quite evil, of the past of Norway.
It is among the most expensive plates that can be bought.
But, in fact, it's all expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich costs you the 10€ refrigerator ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the right-hand racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July".
The Norwegians are very much concerned with believing that in their beloved country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, there has been growth since the beginning of the 70s, one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're so good," says Anna, our roommate, while it's passing rakfisk bands and that, with its long red and surprising blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian wellness.
"We are, as you have said, wise people."
Its English, like the majority of people in this country, is impregnable.
"We don't like to wake up, we don't like hospitality."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While the whole world lacked money that it did not have during the years prior to the financial crisis around the world, Norway maintained the well-closed ticket.
"As long as we can fly in winter and send in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," adds with an unloaded unloaded.
I'm in the snow working with her to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now an alkaline hamburger is no doubt something different and quite sweet to taste.
But in the night, he's back that bad-ass fish.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which the communists vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that gives the most proof of the natural spots.
A television has connected directly to a representative carrying pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like Eurovision's competition.
"What are your score for the best fish up there on the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are smiles and applause.
A man falls out of the chair, maybe conquered by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the vampires of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Niito faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his duties, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already in itself congested, a steel circle has been installed from the moon that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing huge falls on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from arriving at their place of work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's facing a complicated task.
Mexico has had good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is faced with a war against drug trafficking that has taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government has a great commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Mr. Peña Nieto early this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Space.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before joining the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was a governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very popular state and with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory where he used to move.
A sincere man
In the town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with affection.
Its residents assign it to the merit of the growth of tourism in the area and the construction of infrastructures.
To reach the city, one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the roads surrounded and filled with bags that were rehabilitated.
You can also see cards with your name in the entry of a modern poly-portrait and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We believe that he can make a real and lasting change," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"In particular, in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted 81-year term in power, the PRI was debanked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mr Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations in the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also reiterates the qualifications that opposition makes for the lack of the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and above all he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other hand, that is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast with the decorated streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high-speed highway tracks is, in many ways, a suburbation of Mexico's own city.
And the problems of the municipality are also difficult and urban.
Early this year, military intervention was requested to help combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert parcel, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women killed have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than the Juárez City, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is a synonym for the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best case, that I cannot address the problem of feminicide while in charge.
The most critical of them accuse their administration of making a bad look.
In a home of hormigon, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irenea Budendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing photos of her lost daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana died in 2010.
However, her family believes that her husband killed her.
"When I got home, it seemed as if the body had been cleaned up," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been hit and the dead burden had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, along with a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
"The authorities of the state have treated me as if it were an old chysmiss, an abbot, a complaint.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that they go away."
"But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his mandate.
"I hope it's the same kind of president that it was when he was governor," said PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of the City of Niza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't report any ill-treatment, according to the prosecutors
The prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his stay in prison
The trial is based on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia.
The defence wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove the Friday that the army of Bradley Manning, accused of the most confidential information filtering in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to declare the ill-treatment that he was suffering while under military detention.
During the inquiry that the prosecutor made to Manning before the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor, Commander Ashden Fein, stated that the records of the weekly visits of unit officials received by Manning during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about the treatment he received.
The questionnaire, which was carried out during a view made on the request for defence, was disappointed that his detention had been severe and that it had already been sufficiently punished, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was in custody.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In the evening, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officials completed after their visits to Manning during his arrest in the military prison in Quantico, where he was imprisoned in a maximum detention regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials would have asked Manning questions and recorded their answers.
When the Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified for the treatment that the Cellarians gave him as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officials asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concern about some issues and that the officials who visited him had talked about these problems and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they had not left a background on those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problem," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he had received during the meeting held in January 2011 with a council to consider the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form month earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "emission prevention" regime under which it was found.
The military said that they had placed it under that restrictive regime, which was located under surveillance by possible suicide, in order to ensure their protection and security of others.
"I would like the bigger state to assume that I was well and (I) wanted to stop being vulnerable... so that I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning witnessed Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to the military prison based on the Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost his knowledge due to heat.
He said that the fact that he wouldn't be allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening to him in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world is so reduced to Campamenta Arafjon, to that Jaula," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that hole."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a pickle, a manta, some candy, some clothes and his gloves.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to sleep during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out looking at his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he returned in the night, they would wake him up so that he could come back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint on the treatment received by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
The judge asked Manning on Friday about a statement he had made in the Jewish declaration, which, after being forced to sleep overnight in his Quantico cell, he was obliged to remain standing out of the foot in front of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover with the wallet during the account.
During the trial of the judge on Friday, Manning said he gave up on the order he had given to the Celler that he should leave the wallet with which he could have been covered, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a threat to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used his inner garment or his shoes to auto-let him, but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had withdrawn from their cell their inner clothes, their shoes and their gloves.
Its lawyers hope that the judge will take into account at least the experiences he has experienced during his stay in prison and will dramatically reduce his judgment if he has been condemned in the war council, which is expected to begin at the beginning of the coming year.
The defence stated that it was intended to make Manning declare guilty of minor crimes and to defend other charges considered too extreme.
The view is expected to be resumed this weekend and it is expected that the taxes argue that the conditions of the detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was detained in accordance with the applicable rules to any prisoner found under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully promoting the publication of information on the Internet, filtering information from the national defence and theft of property or public records.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could face a chain of perpetual succession.
My Mexican-US identity crisis
He claims that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who have been, says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarret notes that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just been down by the explosion and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some maps indicated the path to two wheels: one for "Mexico" and the other for "Externals".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, I've been called "Mexicon" all my life.
This is ethnic tachyography, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irelandes" or my friends in New York qualify themselves "Italian".
Later I decided by Mexican-US.
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandmother's homeland, tachygraphs or guidedons were not necessary.
It was simply the United States.
I speak Spanish. It's good enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the voice level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put me in the car for strangers.
I thought this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
At the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries met, he noted: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wanting to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now so likely that a Mexican stays in Mexico and is able to move to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade block in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and is full of regrets.
Most Americans are probably never agreed that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half their territory to gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that are remembered are everywhere.
So, at the moment a U.S. official says anything that makes Mexico the least critical, he starts to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican elite, about how the United States is using the sovereignty of its neighbours.
And the children of Moctezuma stand in the foot of war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really presents all of a challenge is that they have with more than 35 million Mexican-US people living in the United States.
Are we talking about a rehearsal?
There's plenty.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genetic tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, who closed the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time that person fell into a certain profile: dark skin, low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We're his descendants and we're loyal.
Mexico doesn't.
And, although we may be living now the American dream, having gone to good schools and having had good work, we can never lose sight of what we are living in is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is true.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many Mexicans belonging to the elite of the leading class do not like them.
The feeling is mutated.
We see ourselves as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the hombre as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
As you can see, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves behind this seat belt, living well in the United States, but still, as single souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when she was a girl, I remember that there was this rock between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first people know with more strength who they are and for the second time this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they're not part of either of them.
We like to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres of the North, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not attracted to any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I've buried myself during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect with the diaspora again.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised Mexican ambassadors, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American partners how fantastic it is to visit that country and press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not going to happen.
There's too much fun.
And, with the inequality of wages, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, guys.
That's right.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still sensitive about how they were treated to their families much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Streets of Battalion, New Oriente Medium
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a little unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of useless and usual discussions about who started first, many of the buildings have been reduced to ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, Gaza's missiles have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be trapped in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left it all behind the taste of it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional albatross.
Maybe this makes your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for believing that your fatal situation could be reversed.
A war that neither loses nor wins
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November is kept high, the attacks this week have strengthened both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say that they have forced the Israelites to withdraw, although Gaza has received a good palace.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and put pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and inhabited regions of the planet, Israel has not been able to end with Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining land in Cisjordania, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implodent Fatah rivals, the more moderate Palestinian façade.
In addition, Hamas' leaders could come to the conclusion that time is playing for them.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamás has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim alliance to Israel, has taken over Hamas' cause. It has also done so by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states in the Gulf.
The excellent members of Hamas say that the half-month Islamic is around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbullah Party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an ever-increasing Islamic trend could defeat Bashar Assad, until reaching Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern part of Israel, the growth of Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, in contrast with the most popular and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lacquery he ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Muslim Brothers are the first brothers of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist to which even Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
In the meantime, Israel's lasting branch will bring the opposite conclusion.
With regard to the military issue, Hamas has been placed in his place.
The anti-missive system of Israel's Hierro has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep more quietly... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a first minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended with the lives of about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicides, in part due to the barrier that flows to the West Bank, the main plot of an aspirating territory to become the state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of a more durable line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why forget those Palestinian returns by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in Cisjordania, wouldn't they shoot cohetes like they did their co-compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good shot if they raise their head.
It may be that the heavy salt is imputed, even though the Arab spring could change its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere lack appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is higher than its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the high fire is a good augury and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also have thought for a long time.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, privatizing Palestinians of their right to self-determination implies creating a powder that will one day operate in the territories occupied by Israel in the same way that a bus in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and democracy, increasing the situation as the Arab population grows.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a diplomatic penalty every time.
Both gangs need a force of people in conflict.
The solution continues to be the prayers of those who are conscious of both sides, most of the outside world and this periodical: two states and the cessation of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the high fire gives a little more incentive to the generous people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to freeze the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas that it accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arab agents on the subject should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would further contribute to the creation of a Palestinian State than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first mandate he refused to present his own plan for peace.
Once again in the White House, it seems like a reticent to devote his attention.
This attitude suggests a grim vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The General Tobacco Packing Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on the cajets of a green-coloured waste, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by an envelope of an olive leaf, amazing images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies who are sick because they are children of smoking parents.
Except for different health images and warnings, the only difference between cajetillas, mandatory since Saturday is the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of font.
This is the strictest system of the world applied to the tobacco package.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the roots that make this habit a glamour.
It trusts in studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he never does.
"It can be seen that children, even from very old age, understand the message that tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how the girls were related to the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted a tremendous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious indiscriminate consequences," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco, Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will bring to sell in the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited from the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the request for pills and silicone covers to capture the unpleasant images of the cajetillas had been fired almost two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a rejection of the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to major institutions and was waiting for more existences.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on television and sports patrols and binding on most sellers not to place cigarettes on the market, tobacco marketing has been carried out online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be restricted to foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and just leave this little window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase in brand reviews published on social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You can ask yourself whether it's just a private citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that industry is focusing more on the new legislation than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unduly restricted, although none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO has adopted a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had held talks with other countries considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in cajetillas.
Currently they are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, it is considered to be applying more difficult laws.
In Australia many smokers appear to be vulnerable.
"The photos don't affect me.
I just don't make them happen."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Indeed, there is only one reason why I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the old King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that uniform cajetillas make it more difficult to place them in the stars.
"It was usually an hour late to discover a delivery; now it's four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned the tobacco altogether and then, now, it is, well, it is over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to burn a little.
During the days of the Action Day of Thank you for this year, I suddenly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane in which we wanted to suffer a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about the burnout.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be interested, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting about Duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and child development experts who praise the goodness of abortion.
According to them, it is good that, both us and our children, we get drunk once and for all.
Breaking down the brain requires the brain to find interesting options and may foster creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of burnout.
So, should we accept the abuse with good motive?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
Firstly, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for the eight, abortion would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey says, the cathedral of Greek and Roman History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Levely History" ("The Abbreviation, an animated history") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not.
"In fact, the history of abortion is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are graffiti in Latin about the confusion that occurred in the first century C.E.
We also have to plant ourselves as we define burnout.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and developing the idea before a group of discussion groups formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the frustration as the experience of "satisfying, but not able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between abstinence and apathy is that the person does nothing but wants to do it.
It says that with the patio there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of abstinence, he says, is "the modification of the attention process, associated with a low state of mind and a feeling that time is passing slowly".
Absorption can sound terrible like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are depressed tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed think that the problem has it.
Sometimes we think we're exhausted, when what really happens to us is that we have problems to concentrate.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boreddom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person who read the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the room included a TV program to all volumes that had no relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was only understandable, while the third group didn't listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more frustration than the other two groups; it was worth focusing on them, but they were not sure why and gave it to the burn.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the shift of attention can lead to frustration," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Goelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to burn you."
"In fact, we now know that moving or making garages, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of burnout, can actually help to fight it, because they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what is going on at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly popular movie.
But some people are more inclined to be offended than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "scaling trend" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repeat and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at West Florida University, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to burn more often than girls, and specifically need more external and varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a kind of group that gets used to quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of the adolescents said he would be drunk while he was in school or doing his duties, while 23 percent said he would be drunk when he wasn't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would open up.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current rate of burnout, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "divorce is a period in which abortion reaches its highest rates", largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control about what they want to do.
So I come back to my question of the principle: is it good to get drunk?
Sometimes it is not, because, given the extreme, it can cause us to expose to absurd physical risks, such as taking abstinence or falling into the consumption of substances as a means of combating them, as well as demonstrating research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are talking about the connection between abortion and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
"The abuse is how it has the brain to tell you you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's best.
If you are exhausted and use that energy to touch the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see TV, it's possible to satisfy you in a short time, but not in a long time.
"So, if your child is exhausted and gives you an iPad, it is possible that he will not get drunk anymore, but he will not have learned to be interested in himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "The ability to do so applies to other situations," she said.
Your child learns not only to enjoy himself alone, but also to learn to better control himself in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise the burning.
But we shouldn't be too critical with him either.
Our goal should, rather, be to feel comfortable apart from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to burn more, but it is a very anxious and anxious desire to relate it to something that deserves the punishment," he says.
It points out that what people really are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops."
Colored: without a book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and footballist in South Colorado, is facing a criminal process that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, in the caves near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and soon thereafter Orozco received a legal quote on the possession of drugs and related articles (lower criminals carrying one hundred United States dollars) in which he was informed of the date of trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
Are they?
In weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of cases less due to drug content than in the law.
Hundreds of minor crimes by marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to present charges against the 21-year-olds on small-scale possession, which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative districts in Colorado have committed themselves to continuing with the open cases of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the south-east of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of marijuana shops, which have recently been authorised, in their communities.
"All this is changing so fast that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for the regulations in Washington state are also giving it back to the matter.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licences, all before the deadline comes on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states with regard to the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a representative of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what could work.
"There is no truth before it serves us as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, entered into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will be born, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues to be resolved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "appropriate access" to the authorised marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres from schools, parks, child playing areas or child centres.
"In no place will it be more difficult to place an authorized cannabis business than in the urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a port of the Centre for Legal cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief police officer of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to intervene in judicial proceedings for minor deficiencies in the possession of marijuana to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would cease to present charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said they would be responsible for the implementation of the city's legislation governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue traffickingrs and drug dealers.
In the county of Weld, in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a more strict vision.
After the vote, he made sure that his office would continue to pursue the cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face loads of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to intervene in judicial action against those deficiencies that were committed at the time they were committed," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Massa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, are no longer targeted by adults with small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, a prosecutor in the county district, supported this decision, but also decided not to underestimate any of the cases pending for possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting time continuing to comply with the law until this change occurs," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the use of marijuana for recreational use within the Government and the judicial system would be easy.
The counter-decitive reactions that arise throughout the state demonstrate a marked ambivalentness among officials in relation to the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier to the district tax," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the defendants for the possession of marijuana and is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"There have been so much time to bring people to the courts that, in fact, they can still not accept it as legal," he said.
By being the first states to consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if it was alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become a national test case on drug law.
While lawmakers and state officials have a new legal border, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defences of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will be granted.
Despite the fact that some of the above-mentioned arrests have been produced by marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed in most of its existing marijuana sales business with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"While anti-drug agents may not take doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably show resistance to the operation of the State-controlled stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drug policy ex-examination director of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will take about a year before any of them can be opened.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and it is likely to approve the coming week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which we allow someone and then we have a serious federal problem," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the association.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted against to vote in favour of what the state voted for."
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I've been caught up in Oxford for being a Tory."
Students are not attacked by their viewpoints only now
I don't remember any moment in my life in which I haven't dreamed of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I thought was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary Greek symphony that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, in two weeks to occupy my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to run the course of History, I had already done the curses, which led to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were upset.
The Evening Standard said that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some university associates maintaining sexual relations in the room on the side.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in undiscovered bags.
The truth was less fun.
Get out of there.
Yes, yes, because he had been subjected to an austerity and intimidation system.
Not because of my extravagance name, nor the fact that he would come from a private school.
I was told for a single reason, that in the corner of the supposed illustration there was something shocking and barbarous: my father, the dead Woodrow Wyatt, was an outstanding adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's going on now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the Conservative Party is such in Oxford that a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled persons and ethnic minorities last week.
Conservative members of the JCR (grade students group) of the Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as thankless people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: young, bright and right) on students' policy and presented to the Touries as excentrical and neonozies.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, a representative of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a flat suit and a baton with the silver pudding.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkey heads" by introducing higher matrix rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old Vice-President of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Dominic newspaper that "there is a growing tendency of left-wings in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old historian in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "inconsistency", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old elected president of the UCA, says that the attitude of members of the JCR towards people who are right-wing has improved.
"This poses a threat to the context of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he said.
During my first weeks in Oxford he was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, was a 18-year-old terriblely scared young man.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
Last year, the university had voted to reject Margaret Thatcher, an ancient student, a title "honoris cause" after the cuts in the funding of higher education.
The environment would have made any stalinist scared.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university, when new students met and met the cathedrals, I received a sample of the horror I expected.
I found out that the cathedrals not only made the rough view of the mofa that was made by the conservative university, but that they participated in it with good gain.
The policy of the strike of miners, privatization and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the seminar's wooden rooms.
The first time I attended was to translate into the French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Mr. Wyatt," said cardinal Harry Pitt, "Please translate the first paragraph."
I don't know.
Pitt, a humble man with a face that looked like a biscuco mass, knew well how to excavate bad cars.
"Is that these teachers refuse to learn French or is that, simply, they are tons?" he asked.
The other colleges were laughing.
I was struck by the tears I tried to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, always and when I'm not too busy knowing people," Pitt said.
I returned to my room as a soul in pain.
That night I felt alone at the time of dinner at the university; then I felt a light palm on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OAUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it's going.
They're going to deal with anything that's suspicious of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but you know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Many Tories have recently come to appear to be workers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried to dissimulate.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year-old student of Philosophy, Politicians and Economy who, in a paradoxical way, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist poet.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I've become a perverted sushi.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"There's a gap between one and the other, right?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the Liberal Act of the 1960s.
Could I take a normal life in Oxford someday?
Would I be obliged to stay with people who would think of me only after tonight?
Should I be a worker and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I was expected were presented as a purgatorium of ostracism and isolation.
The only open cathedral Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him not only for being the Conservative Party, but also for the counsel of Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to move from Oxford to my parents' home in London daily, finding refuge in my family and friends with the most open metropolis.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear tears of sleep.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to glow.
"Give me another chance.
I'm sure they've only done it to make sure.
I'd break my heart if you left it."
In addition to many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had been subjected to pressure and had given up his faith.
The following week, during a seminar in which another cathedral of History had been insinuated, speaking entirely seriously, that I was a "enemie of the people", I decided to do the same.
I admitted that my parents had "blowed my brain" and called them "old stupid."
The trail took a little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my university career at Oxford.
That's why my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was in a rush of fear and, five minutes ago, my pursuers disappeared.
When the suitcase was made, I took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Maybe you'll call me a weak lion.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, is hiding behind a reputation of nothing worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
Due to the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Costura", which has opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I in England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Costura", a retrospective apotheic that gathers more than 130 high-cost clothes created by its "maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inconclusive Italian accent.
This sample is the column of a story whose only protagonist is "the Mr. Garavani", but which could not have been written without its different clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinating by the enerricated and distant world of Christmas.
In the first room of this exhibition, it opens to the next 3 March, many private letters and photos with the signature of the most guaranteed aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of its social rise: a humble fashionist from the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to an image of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't shut down the hills of their pills on your magnificent carpet as they make some beautiful celebration of pop music," says Baronessan Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to be invited to your chalet in Gstad," explains the exclamation of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notority.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modist.
Many years ago, after a demonstration in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to eat at his bed.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the room, decoration, food, music, everywhere was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Cost Week, in 1995.
"Never passes by fashion because its designs are art works," ends.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessives, but of well-recorded love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the gallerys of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous six-metre pass that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must stand by the passerala to observe a "audience" of the school that lights Valentino teachers' works, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the dresser who used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat belonging to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this public of manichies, names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg are rejected.
Naty Abascal and the modist, in 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantson, a shirt, a "gilette" jacket and a jacket from the autumn-January 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his feminity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors you use, they have great light and they're "given" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The fashion princess and secretary Patricia della Giovanampaola d'Arenbergampco can forget the first time she saw a Valentine.
When he was a teenager and lived in Italy, he dreamed of getting to have the age and opportunity to use one of his nights...
Finally, the time came at the end of the 1990s.
I buy my first Valentine's dress to use at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Linen.
It was a red shirt, with a fall of flights, "corsage" dressed and heard a word of honor.
"It was a dream made reality," says Rodrigo's widow in Arenberg.
"Valentino is independent of fashion, his obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashionable wedding clothes with "the best care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also the set of memories that she's wearing."
The King of Fashion
The great end of the show of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's novelty in his wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modist calls its costumes) to develop that marfil-sede fabric with hair crests, twelve different types of coating and a four- and-a-half neck.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that garment represents a token of the high cost of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Blessed for years with the "know-how" of the elite, now Valentino is his best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of higher rank in Italy), Cavaliere del Labouro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, condemned with the Legion de Honor, Garavani collects both the honours and any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refining, his peace, his pure and perfect look," recognizes D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw it was a month ago in a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a big friend of mine.
"It was impenetrable, time doesn't go on for him."
If a princess says...
The world's toughest office: Kawah Ijen's human bear
For four euros, the Indonesian Volcanoes are judged on life and health by carrying 70 kilograms of oil through stone-sends
There are people for whose work is hell and another who, literally, works in hell.
It's the case of Anton Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives taking off the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To that end, it must descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfuric gas generated by the Earth's inputs is solidified when it comes into contact with the air.
After putting up large steel rocks, which totally weigh about 70 pounds, they are caught in two drums that carry their homs through rocks sent by stone.
They are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres high, but the excellent porters are late for more than 40 minutes by going up to the top of the tower, keeping the balance and measuring with ten steps to avoid falling and falling by the precipice.
They know that any delay could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was fired years ago by the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners win 5 cents of euro per kilo of oil that they extract
Once up, there is a step between tourists who photographed them as if they were circus monks and, effectively carrying the canadas weights, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little lower, up to 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Grimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and never better said to its employees that it pays 662 Indonesian rubies (5 cents of euros) per kilo of oil.
He then sells it for 10,000 rubies (EUR 83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture cereals, artificial, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar white.
"As usual it is to load 70 pounds, we get some 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anton, who often makes three daily doors.
It takes three hours for each and ends in the mud, but it allows you to add 138,000 rubies (EUR 11,5) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery for such inhuman effort, it's the triple of what I'd win in the field.
"The miners' journal is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) the day and the monthly average wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," the spokesman explained, who had previously worked as a Albanian on the Bali island tourism.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the tajo was not so hard, but Anton returned with his family to Banywangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as confusing as the gold: "I married a young man from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought him to Java to become Islam."
Then she has asthma, breathes with difficulty, always sweats and tears her eyes over toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anton took three to play the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose oil has already begun to pass billing despite covering his face with a special mask and gloves.
It has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it is always dry and its eyes are rinsed by toxic gases that emit the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more acceptable English.
Disciplined by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a guest or a receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mill.
Sharing a clean wooden cabin with other carriers, it rises every day to the two of the madrugadas because the fragrance does not leave it to sleep at night, when its distinctive yellow color becomes blue and bright in the middle of the darkness.
By challenging the shadows, Ant goes down to the crater with a little crater attached to his pocket, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 porters load the oil jars over their homs from the bottom of the crater
Despite its grievous benefits, the mining company has not been able to extract oil to save costs or provide no equipment to the porters, who work for their account and to the extent the weight.
In fact, I don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) in charge of camera that, along with the entry of EUR 15,000 rupees (€1.2), the guards of this natural park cover tourists who look to photograph the volcano and their human mussels.
"This work is for animals and not for people," Madrusin protested, a 42-year-old supplier who took Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving the college.
You can raise up up to 110 pounds, make sure you're working "all you can" because you need the money to educate your three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to wake up, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the salt burns the throat and hears the eyes when the wind changes improvise and captures the miners in the thick columns that emerge from the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious diseases... above, of its usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and joints in the bones, which have been damaged by the weight of the bones.
By balancing the canista on its back, Unainik can load only 50 pounds to 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions set up 15 tons of oil in the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamamsari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a hair road between the disease.
"I'm not going to wake up, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of its five children, the older, 30-year-old, is also working on the oil charge.
Time passes, but the misery of generation in generation is one of the toughest offices in the world: what makes the human mussels of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Sangpurens blame the career, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot husband, you're my patriot wife, we fulfill our civil duty and we create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these verses are part of a propaganda of lies, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video became viral in YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bath (bollo) in the oven" to withdraw from Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, offers the hope that with the announcement they will be able to call attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says I want to use the power of music to make people fulfill their "national duty."
This is something purely from the Internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst people in the world to play ourselves, so we felt that this was a subject we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating whites.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do the most creative thing to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1,2 children
What is not taken so easily is Singapore's government.
It costs US$1,300 per year in politics to encourage citizens to have more children.
A Government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 for children, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city of rich and high-tech state in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently located in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time I was above 2 - known as the recovery rate was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Matrimonio Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond marriage and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to the continuation of marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an ui immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the population ' s decline has created a reconciliation between the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobic is only spread against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who criticize low wages and do not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and savings for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline at birth rate has a known effect on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has been able to control the number of small apartments known as "cacaca de zapatos", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square metres surfaces and have been very successful in selling.
However, there is concern that they can promote a life of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "sacks" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units spend days, even weeks, faster than units of greater size.
This makes it much better for our box flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer guidance to the developers, which had previously been put to work if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city of state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility rates, talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are face-to-face and also education, so many people are putting it on," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it is important for me to count my own money and time," says another young man in his 20 ’ s.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, because the government is trying to force its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Real Academy of Spain, it is the quality of private life or "the area of private life which is entitled to protect from any introduction".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers posed by advantage on the Internet situations that would certainly not be shared out of line?
the Periodic interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very mine", in the personal plan, and "in the key and user name", when they applied it to social networks.
"More deep secrets would not take them to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"They're very secretive, my mother can know them, but not everyone else," she says.
In FB, you get beautiful images or games.
I'm also interested in my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine, or someone who's making the ridiculous," he says.
The child realizes that it is wrong to publish obscenities, people who are unstinting, crimes, or to write embarrassing or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just going upstairs," he adds.
"Social networks are busy, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
There is no doubt that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't have done it to anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest admission does not know 20 of the people listed in their list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he said.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated to him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I'm pressed or just asked for my bag," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's not the experience of what is known today as cyberbullying.
To a friend's acquaintance, they were exorcising him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"I don't know who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"I just put them in private."
Then explain a series of steps to secure the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would pick up pictures of strangers in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
Yeah, I'd, if I got hurt or I'd get it.
"Even I know that's cyberbulling," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and licensed in Education and Education, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," he said.
Porras notes that the academic Marc Prensky, master at Pediagía by Yale University and author of the work of Natives and Digital Migrants, came up with these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we are still learning," he says.
Please note that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what they should or should not distribute, publish or say to an age that does not give age for that."
"They must also be selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what privacy is for children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them he doesn't do it doesn't serve," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing this on the Internet?
Oh, would you like them to publish a photo of you like that of a friend?
You know what others publish about you?
When you tag photos of parties, do you ask others to tag them?
And again, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do off line.
It's the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as must be in the social networks," he said.
Watch
Estuado Guardia, university cathedral, primary teacher and educational consultant, notes that it is essential that the parents of the family learn the policies of the social networks.
When they understand each of the clues, they have solid grounds to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardian, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "not talking to strangers".
Finalize the Union Summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandaters.
The effect sought repeated opportunities to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unashur, but the sources of Chancellor and Presidency indicated at the outset that they would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some time.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Olanta Humala, during a brief press statement.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day alone, the unsound video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private, restricted audio".
The few information that was circulated among the reporters was provided by press carriers from some of the Unashur Governments attending the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document published during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media to ask for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about the proclamation of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last, Peru was the host of the Third South American Summit of the Arab States (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite the demand for the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not spread.
On the ASPA official website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international accounts, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists had safe transmission systems but were limited to the maximum access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure by the Hague Court to address a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional appointment and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which began Monday in La Haya to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will strike and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with her Chilean couple.
" Chile has been, and will continue to be a respected country of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a clap of hands, along with the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two Presidents to submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia announced this week the Bogotá Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the errors of that international court, after a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit took place with the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011, after the resignation of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the census.
The host president, Olanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the middle of Lima.
The mandater read the final document in which it reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries had been established for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, it was stated that the countries of UNASUR would make "a significant step towards the goal of a South American citizen for what we are expanding the housing agreements".
It was reported that actions to improve "cooperation in combating urban insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-cost Internet access in all South America continents, and to address the risks of natural disasters jointly and efficiently".
With a crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triunfalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and bring about a better future for our people," Humala added.
"We have decided to privileged a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and by creating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the cross-border islands of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the South American Union," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among its neighbours was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional conference that he hoped to meet with his partner in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal respectfully with the maritime difference after a failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"It is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," said Santos.
"We are going to review all these roads, not exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they are planning to attend the command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, as part of the summit, the defence ministers of the block was gathered in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency for the time being of the regional block.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizen": Rafael Korea
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizen is a goal in which "Suramérica, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidency Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but are now practically a patriot".
In that regard, he defended the project to establish the South American citizenship that the United States members of the Unashur were all about.
"There must be free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with the integrations of the Andina Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want us to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President was further shown to support the recommissioning of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the preambular preamble to renegotiation of the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give the cathedra are never committed to anything, and instead, we South Americans sign it all.
"It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said Julian Assange, in all connection with Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that she was not repentant of that decision because she had not betrayed her principles, but had respected her "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at his time, "there had been doubts that Assange had been extradite to a third country and was not respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be subjected in his territory to interrogation for a alleged sexual crime when "the Swedish law itself allows him to conduct it through a video conference, which could be done from Ecuador's embassies in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health is impaired.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian mandater.
What is true is the danger of damaging your physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"That makes the health of any person complicated," he added.
Correa noted that the asylum solution given to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by granting a rescue guide that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there has been negotiations with London for a solution to the entire foundation of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange attorney Baltazar Garzón is making a series of procedures in different European institutions," he said.
And he thought that "if Great Britain comes tomorrow, this rescue is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permits its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr. Assange at Ecuador's embassies in London or asks him about Skype himself this problem is over tomorrow.
Correa took advantage of to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of press and pointed out that what she did not tolerate is "mediacrisis, evil faith and lie, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of press are not the evil and wicked politicians but the bad journalists on the basis of profit, singing and exorcism," he said.
In that regard, it was welcomed that these journalists are no longer " neither the banks nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries who dominate Ecuador", and it was further stated that being reelected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and the corruption of legality" because it actually "disrupted the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered the "perfectly relevant" wish of his Colombian homologist, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the failure of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which benefited from the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that's not happening.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
You have to process them extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the maritime dispute that they held in the same court in Peru and Chile and considered that "it is right for Latin America to seek international courts if both countries are committed to accepting a serious mistake."
Referring to the possibility of being present as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa made sure that if she loses the February 2013 commissions, she will withdraw from public life.
In staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed that possible victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and then we would leave public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Vice-President Nicolas Maduro, and he told me that he was on his way to a treatment that was scheduled for routinely, which was expected to take the campaign back to Cuba.
"It does not mean a withdrawal in the health status of President Chávez," he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United States of America (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Deaths by AIDS today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 when she was confirmed as a test result: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb fell on me," it meant remembering the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "more softer", with no obvious success.
The boy hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform about it; with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is, of course, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of human immunodeficiency (VIH) 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic refused to leave him "because he brought a cut."
Then, having AIDS was a symptom of death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, unaware of its disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "infected" its immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the world's AIDS phenomenon, at least the first reported cases, "the great achievement means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in an timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV Unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was evaluated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients have when they start diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a content of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous means that those who receive the HIV diagnosis positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as they remain in control they can live without problems up to 75 years", the interviewer explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has significantly decreased in recent years in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS declined from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have fallen from the presence of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and 187 died until May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are you still dead?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, so it's happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not had a drug deficiency the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their condition of infection, that is, in later stages of the disease.
He said: "Nive of every ten patients arrive when they already present any opportunistic infection that must be done in order to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to do more early diagnosis and, therefore, they have to offer massive detection tests to all people who need it."
In its proposal, experts and staff of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Cosida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who attempted to test a particular laboratory, were motivated only because he had done it to a friend and, despite his brief age, was already in the AIDS stage and even sarcoma suffering from Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I better go back three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take drugs.
At the time, his parents only knew he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but responsible, I care for myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, within the framework of the World Day of the Sea, are afraid.
To be tested, if they were at risk, that they would soon know if they were positive HIV, it's better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn they can live as any person, being responsible.
This, its message, sums up the issue of AIDS combat in 2012.
Congested after indicator
Great are the eggs that are among the health programmes and the common citizen, supported Ricardo Salazar, a caught journalist who has taken the blame on HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "it has actually increased the distribution of condones, before they gave us one or two, now they give us hundred packages, and that's fine but it turns out that some today still have no access to a condon," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is a common question, with a smile and judgements of value for social workers, school directors, health practitioners and staff, to whom adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communiqué assured.
I propose to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condones are not only after the showers and those hundreds are found in public bathrooms in the places where young people frequent.
It's not to motivate promiscuousness.
It is not about paying the bills and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to approach the convictions of those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases collected (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4° nationally in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13° HIV.
92 per cent of the injuries correspond to the sexual path, 6 per cent to the bloodway and 2 per cent to the perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can be living with HIV because in a recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Tribunal a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario places a negative precedent for any national company with restrictions in the neighbouring country having problems of solvency.
It would therefore be said that procedures for the survival of signatures that permit Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and bars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the support to the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrots Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican firms undefended against the possibility of putting their property in the Bravo area.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
In the meantime, while the judge of the case pointed out that creditors should be governed by the United States Quebec Act, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, said that the main procedure was the commercial competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the University of International Market Law was created, placing itself as an architect of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote intercompaniments, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition, the debts of the Vitro branches with their mother would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are average dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose debts were assessed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The fact is, in addition, that by remaining the votes of the branches, in all ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, the "boutter" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliott International and Liverpool Limited, will not be achieved by most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The date shall be ignored by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blames Vitro of the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to the relief of the serious economic crisis that he faced in the United States, bringing the collections to the country.
The signature of the Gonzalez Sada family will therefore provide a reconsideration remedy to the court itself so that the vote will be brought to its full, i.e. the five judges, given that they only voted three.
In the absence of this progress, the Cerciorare resource will be claimed to require the revision of the process by a higher authority, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The gravity of the case is that the court submitted a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that it had failed in addition to the agreements signed by both countries to bring it under Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Marking of two bands: they catch Vitro and catch him in the country.

Searching for Dragon Mart
Meeting at a forum at the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, of a Colossal Sales and Face Distribution Centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribe of products in the country of the wall, with a stone dwelling area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the rulers of the southern region to oppose the monumental thing that led to a part of protected areas and raised the mother of all the hideous against the industry.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "The balloon has been my life"
Héctor "Hetin" Balloon Trotamunds Reyes was more than 60 years old related to the sport of the table and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
A few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local balance sheet as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a cerebral derm bound him to a wheel chair in 2008, Reyes was involved in sports for more than 60 years, he was a player of lower categories, player of the National Higher Balloonsto, aide and leader of the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or president of the Ballonese Federation.
"He put me many shadows in the balance of my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a first-time visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The prize has been my life."
Kings don't exaggerate when making that avalanche.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and monuments that mark his extensive trajectory, are thus certified.
Bayammon in the Heart
Of all, those who are most excited are those who remember their step by the Vaceros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he completed 15 years of working as a co-author or aide of the franchise.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros champions since 1967, and it has been as an apothecary, co-author or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five champions running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I left with one in 1981, the year the start of Jerome Mincy in the UN.
From then on I was charged with "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player from 6"7" of the statue.
Do you want that?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players who've had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to the Francotic Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given him a champion to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The Vaqueros camp with Gausse enjoyed it, but it was already in the distance, since it had already appeared in federal orders by 1988.
For that time, I would like to enjoy their performances and those of Mincy at the National Team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States during the First Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World, where we arrived in the fourth place and should have been bronzed not to be by that Canadian tree that made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this World Group of 1990 the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like he won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Spanish in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave him a pair to the United States team, which was quite the same as the bronze we won in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had a "Tunito" Colón and James Carter young brothers, Leon brothers (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90s due to an injury in the wheelchair.
A team that may not have been the best in staff terms, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Prelimic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner instead of players suspended by the flag of the American Sea of Plata, we gain gold against all pronosics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
There's no doubt that's been Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't count on his trajectory in the different links he played.
Who's the best drunk leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good bed including Julia Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young man, I like Leo Ariel's work.
What do you think your biggest success in the federation is?
It has been part of the most glorious period of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and was that at the beginning of the 1990s the UN BSN had up to 17 teams in a period.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would like to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face other teams of other islands of the island in national playoffs.
Even now children travel and play too much unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of the composite and course certificates for leaders, table officials and trees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
What I do is listen to music, see videos of my time music on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes when I go to dance games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Kill actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, best known as "J.R." in the "Dallas" television series in which he engaged a man of unscathed, malicious and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the giant oil dealer J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" television series became a symbol of the adventure in the 1980s, died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family communication provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., "Dallas" producer house.
"Lary was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the birthday of Grace's Day of Action.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and the century, was with Hagman when he fell into a Dallas hospital, her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
I'd be happy for everything I knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, graceful, loving and talented, and I'll make it very interesting.
"He was an original person and lived his life at the most," said Gray in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with hepatitis in 1992 and recognized that he had had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", scattered by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was changed when he found a genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and led him to live with him in his house.
He was also a protagonist of two comedians who were short-lived, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well-received papers in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the charmingly disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectations about a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars spent in shelters.
He also helped give the series a record of listening at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million televisions were synchronized and converted to "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was the funeral of J.R., Kristin (translated by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. swallowed her and then threatened her with a prostitute charge unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corruption with a charismatic smile: a corrupt entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), out of the house.
"I know what I want in the J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he's lost.
Major Victoria, coprotagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman of the Friday as someone "great, inside and outside of the screen".
It is inevitable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we had the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already completed the recording of five chapters for the second period and a sixth was in process, the chain was informed.
There was no word of warninger or TNT about how the Hagman lost will be handled.
Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who sterilized classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he was married in 1931 to counsel Ben Hagman.
He was successful in the New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time, where many celebrations are held.
In 2001 he wrote his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I would think it would hurt someone or affect them in some way," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a donor of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I value them, I gather with them when they come to their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer you something comforting, like, "Don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but it'll be fine."
He was also an activist against smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and Germans, and global warming.
This semester, when professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was counting on an irresponsible appeal: The end of the "long regressive account" of the May 21st calendar, which has been held by many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he expected in the next couple of months: The Vatican cataclysmic Sandy, a fiscal precedent that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theories at the end of the time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I don't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever been," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And they remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and Germans, and global warming.
"Let's analyze why these ideas extend with time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If the nuclear material fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, could set up a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History Matthew Restall and his fellow Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art and Anthropology, have made a team to attend a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to start the course again, if the world isn't over," Restall said.
Despite the "morning disaster", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final review will be taken in the wake of the Revelation, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night in which the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It took two hours," Restall said about his course for high school students, who was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It makes me curious to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is just a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychologist and nurse, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class I could teach that," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no interviewed student - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the date of expiry of 21 December.
"Our first project was about the Maya prophecy and in some way we did not believe it," said Julie Zeglen, a last year student in Temple, 21, and West Chester.
Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is a apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has been reduced to several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"People on the other hand don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pope's fault.
Again he noted that over the years there have been many days of the final judgment, and he said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will begin to think immediately on the next day" or to imagine that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period that will end the world.
Students and teachers are taking the day off.
Several said they'd think they'd go to "the end of the world."
"Maybe I call some friends so we can go together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
