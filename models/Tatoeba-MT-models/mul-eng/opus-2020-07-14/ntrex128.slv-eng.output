Members of the Valian Congregation are concerned that they are "like Mupetko"
Some members of the congregation were concerned about the proposal to appoint the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.) after a new election.
This has led to plans to change the name of the assembly in the Valian Parliament.
Members of the congregation in the entire political sphere are concerned that they will be ridiculed.
A member of the congregation of the laburists said that they were concerned about their group, "the name of Rome with Twp and Pwp."
For browsers outside Wales: twp means stapest and pwp kata.
A member of the congregation of Plaid Cymru said that their group as a whole was “not satisfied”, and proposed other options.
The Valijan Conservative said that his group was “open spirit” regarding the change of names, while he warned that there was a small difference between MWP and Muppet’s words in speech.
In this context, the phrase ‘w’ is similar to the words ‘u’ in the Yorkshire dictionary.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the draft legislation for the presentation of amendments to the names, said: 'The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the assembly will have to be adopted by the members themselves'.
The Valiant Assembly was authorized by the Act of Government of Wales 2017 to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received extensive support for the appointment of the Valian Parliament.
For members of the congregation, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but in the public consultation, it has received the highest support for ‘MWP’.
The members of the congregation clearly propose other options, but the achievement of the agreement will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who has to submit the draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way in which the Assembly works, including rules on the incompatibility of the functions of the members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide with the referendum on a change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
They want to resolve the ten long-distance dispute with neighbor Greece, which has its province on behalf of Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represented the right to their territory and repeatedly opposed its requests for membership in the EU and Natu.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an anti-police opposition to the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the rapporteurs, including the President of Zoran Zaev's Government, claim that the change in name is the price that they have to pay for EU and Natu's accession.
The bells in St. Martin's church are confused, because the churches in Harlem face difficulties
"The older people I talked to say they were sometimes bar and church on every corner," Adams said.
“Today none other than one.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
“People today are different.
Bari are no longer a neighboring room where people regularly walk.’
In the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and that they will soon be again.
He added that the churches could replace the residential buildings with the common administration (condominiums), where people who will not help shelters in neighboring areas are still living.
"Many people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and therefore the day will come when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that people who will move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches built the Belgian religious community before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The first white methodical church community was established in the 1930s.
The institution took over a black religious community that did the service of God in its vicinity.
St. Martin’s took over a black religious community under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who is on the 125th street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led by a fighter of sellers who did not want to work or support the darkness.
The fire of 1939 had severely damaged the building, but when Johnson’s stepfather planned again, the bells were ordered to attack.
David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in the church of St. Martin’s, proudly referred to the bells as “the bells for the poor people”.
The experts involved in July referred to them as a slightly different "cultural background" and an "excellent historical institution".
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first recorded calls to be played by the dark-eyed singer, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he attended the larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced by St. Martin's church.
In the church of St. Martin’s, in the past few months, a complex story with architects and contractors was held; some were held in church times, while others were sculptors.
Zakstija – the administrative body of the shop, made up of medicines – wrote to the bishop in July that the bishop would “try to transfer costs” to the shop, even though the shop was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some assholes have complained about transparency on the part of the bishop.
Marine dog injured 13-year-old while hunting horses in California
Officials report that on Saturday, in California, the marine dog attacked and damaged 13-year-olds during hunting during the opening season of the fishing season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. in the vicinity of Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that in the morning about half an hour he met a friend when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he went out with the group and helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy was just excited because he picked up the boat, and then he found out that he was shouting, "He shot me!
He's mad at me!"
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole key.
"I've all decided to get out of the water, 'The fish is in the water!'," he added.
The guy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains critical.
The type of sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
In a media statement, the water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said that a few weeks ago, a sea dog was observed in this area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a severe injury to the upper part of the body.
In 48 hours, it was impossible to access the Ponto Beach beach in Casablada to the Swamis beach in Ecinitas because of research and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of marine birds in this area, but most of them are not safe.
Sainsbury plans to enter the British beautiful market
Sainsbury comes to Boats, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful cots as they have in large shops and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beautiful market, which is worth 2.8 billion GBP and is growing, while selling clothes and household appliances, more attractive cotton will be tested in 11 markets per country and in several markets next year if they are shown to be successful.
It was decided to enter beautiful products because the supermarkets were looking for ways to fill the police used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
In Sainsbury, they say that they will double the offer of their beautiful products on 3,000 products and they will first include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPow.
The existing brands L’Oreal, Maybelin and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space in areas with brands similar to those in the shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also restores its artificial supply of cosmetic products, so that most Vegan products are – something younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the brand-new Fragrance Shop will examine the concession in two Sainsbury stores. The first week was opened in Croydon in southern London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and the daily purchase of less food in local stores, supermarkets need to be made more determined to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury, said that retail trades would be similar to wholesalers, as the company of supermarkets is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with many services and non-life products.
Sainsbury’s group opened the Argos outlet in several hundred shops and also in the Habitat trade, after two years of purchasing both beliefs, which increased food sales and were more profitable.
In the past, the supermarket's attempts to renovate its departments with cosmetics and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s joint venture with Verigo Boots at the beginning of the 21st century ended with a dispute about the distribution of drug profits in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 companies of Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
They said Lloyds would have a role to play in this plan, because in four markets, they should expand the supply of luxury brands for the skin, including the brands La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director at Sainsbury's company, said: "We changed our views and impressions of our beautiful boxes and thus improved the environment for our parties.
We have also invested in particularly qualified staff who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, attractive environments and convenient locations, but it means that we are now interested in a beautiful destination, which presents a challenge for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "sit down" because Holly Willoughby got out of business worth 11 million pounds
The star delivers Dragons Den (Good job) is angry because the TV director Holly Willoughby withdrew from his business, worth 11 million pounds, with his commercial brand of life to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothing and Truly's supplements.
Business couples compared the trade mark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, 37th, the leader said he was missing.
Holly Willoughby released the dragons De Petra Jones star because at the last moment she withdrew from her business with the trade mark of the life story to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The authorities say that Jones was “bessen” when the gold girl in the truck during a demanding meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – there is no time for their brands of Truly’s clothes and accessories to be exposed.
The companies compared the trade mark Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and indicated that it would double its assets, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When 37-year-old Willoughby on Instagram reported leaving a trade mark Truly, Jones was traveling from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source suggests: “Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future, with which she would survive the next two decades.
Her decision to immigrate all involved completely.
No one could believe what's going on in the truck because the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods prepared for sale.’
Experts believe that this Morning, which is among the most interesting links to banks in Britain, would have become more and more millions of companies due to large investments in products, from balsine and candles to clothes and supplements, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, was a good friend to Jones and his wife Taro Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly together with Capp's in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple had a lunch together, and Jones has a 40-percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughbyev will become the Ambassador of the M&S trade mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV delivery I’m A Celebrity.
The voice near Jonah yesterday night said, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
"and then we fell in love"
He spoke of the criticisms of the media because of a comment that some consider to be “unpresiding” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leadership.
Why did President Trump leave this way?
With his smiling “newial” voice, the trumpeter said:
"I didn't leave anything."
He insisted that Kim showed interest in another meeting, and her first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leader at the UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea does not see a "relevant answer" in the US on the previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He insisted that instead of this US, they continue with the sanctions they continue to press.
The trumpet was much more optimistic in his bid.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results – they stopped the rocket testing, helped free the tanks and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about Kim's relationship.
"It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this obscenity full of imagination, we have 200 people standing here," said Trump and pointed out to many directly before him.
The tsunamis and floods in Indonesia have left the island, more than a hundred dead.
For example, when managing the impact of the strike in Lombo, it was said to other non-governmental organizations that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lomboka’s inhabitants were displaced, they did not report natural disasters, which was a condition for international aid.
"In a number of cases, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation was somewhat complicated," said Sumbungo.
The organization Save the Children consists of a team that will travel to Pala, but it is not yet clear whether other people can help on the ground.
Sutopa, the representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu and determine whether they will be allowed to help the international agencies.
In view of the lack of natural resources in Indonesia, the state remains totally unprepared for the lack of natural resources.
In Acehu, they built shelters by tsunamis, but on the other side, it is not often practice.
The apparent absence of a warning siren for the tsunamis in Palu is likely to contribute to the loss of life, although it did.
Travel between numerous Indonesian islands also presents a challenge in the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship, which is a victim of torture in Lombok, is swimming against Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo put the improvement of destroyed Indonesian infrastructure in front of his volunteer campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit poses a problem for Jok's administration in re-election next year.
Joko is also faced with the pressure of long-term tensions between the Indonesian sects, where the majority of Muslim members have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim mobs fought on streets with cats, lions, and rifles and other primitive weapons.
Look at this: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge held for a late defeat against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool in 89 minutes before defeating Chelsea in the 1st English league.
Sturridge accepted the offer of Jerdan Shaqiri 25 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal at the end of his team 1-0.
You put it on your left and fired a gun against a remote door.
The star traveled high above the criminal space against the right corner of the door.
The rain finally fell over the door of Kepe Arizabalage and fell to the ground.
"I've just tried to get to the right position for the joo and players like Shaq, they always drag it as far as possible, so I've only tried to get as much time as possible," said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that Kante was coming, so after one touch, I didn't think much of myself and simply decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the afternoon with the seat of Belgian player Edena Hazard in 25 minutes.
The attacker of the blues in this action with five put the yellow back on Matthew Kovačić and fled to Liverpool's half.
Kovačić placed it on the middle of the road and walked on.
Then he gave him a good shot through the defense, and Hazard ran into the prison.
Hazard crossed the defense and shot his left leg against the remote door through Liverpool's doorman Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15 a.m. in San Paolo Stadium.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton in the League of Europe on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunami victims in Indonesia grew at 832
The number of deaths of rapes and tsunamis in Indonesia grew at 832, and the state agency reported an accident on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroh told the press conference that there were many people due to a five-way strike of 7.5, which opened six-metre waves that were trapped in the ruins of the building.
The forest, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is a waste of buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder of a woman who was sentenced to death
The police launched a murder investigation after the women's body was found in Birkenhead in Mercedes this morning.
A 44-year-old with a broken arm was found at 7.55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and was arrested by a 32-year-old man for his death.
The police call on all those in the area who have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the initial phase, but I call on all those who were near the John Street street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to get in touch with us.
I also call on all, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on the tracks with the camera to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is of key importance to our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that she was a woman in Birkenhead, and the body was found inside unpromoted.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene and asked where they found her in the morning.
Investigations are under way, and police are informing their women.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was left without a word.
The representatives were now told that it could take more hours before they could come in again.
The police heard how he explained to the man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
There's a woman in the mirror, all in the sun.
What continues to repeat is "that's so terrible."
At 4:00, there were two police vans inside the corridor, and there was another one outside him right away.
A number of policemen stood inside the corridor and observed a residential block.
All who have any information are requested to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestopers company on number 0800 555 111 and then indicate log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's hip in parliament became the latest reminder of the "recording of history" dispute
Its removal would be a positive right to destroy a number of English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatics of Puritanism.
However, the Cromwell Society has marked Crickov's proposal as "unimpression" and "testing the re-writing of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In today's debate on the removal of the chips, it has become clear that the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminstrsk palace will become a target."
The iconclassism in the British Civil War Cromwell did not even order or perform.
Maybe for the actions of his predecessor from the past century he'll be victimized by Cromwell wrong.
The great presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is about the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the history of personality that is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwella numbers (maybe more famous in the 19th century than today) are seen as a defence of parliament before external pressure, in his case of course monarchy.
But it's a very precise presentation, it's the subject of some historical discussions.
It is clear that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict created further development of our people, and Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time Lord was a protector also deserve praise and remembrance."
A killer pig killed a Chinese farm until death
According to local media reports, the Chinese duster attacked and killed the farm on the market in the southwestern part of China.
The man who only identified him with the “Yuan” was found dead with pristine arterial blood and a blood transfusion near the pig market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, reported on the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig's river is prepared to slaughter pigs on the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
After reporting with the brothers in the middle, she had to travel from nearby Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning a brother found him dead, and the door of the neighbor’s pig was opened.
He said there was a big pigeon in a pigeon with a blood clot.
Forensic research has confirmed that 250-kilograms of dust was frozen to the point of death.
"Branch's legs were bleeding and bleeding," the brothers quoted with the title "Wu" in the magazine Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who attacked Yuan was neither his brother nor his brother.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pigs were closed so that he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leader should discuss the death penalty.
Although rare, the cases of human pest attacks have already been reported.
In 2016 the dustman attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where men suffered severe physical damage.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram duster pushed the whale village across the tractor, but then the woman took the animal away.
After dogs ate a farm from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a ‘supplier’.
"We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very happy... they don't want to hurt you.
Just show them a sufficient measure of respect," he said.
In the south of the United States due to the remains of the Organ Rosa comes a strong rain
According to the report, the Organ Rosa is moving against the colder waters of the north coast of Mexico and weak.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring water to the north of Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa is from Sunday from 5.00 a.m. after sunrise, category 1 with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 km south-east of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
While on the Pacific Ocean, the low-air pressure area is strengthened, which moves east against the west coast of the United States. Rosa will be approaching the Bay California on Monday as a tropical storm and will push a high tropical wind against the north in the south of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the troupes, which will interact with the low air pressure area, will create severe flooding in the wider south-west area in the future.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will result in dangerous floods, floods and the possibility of earthquakes in the desert.
Due to high tropical rain levels, the drop in some cities will reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west parts, especially above the larger part of Arizona, are expected from 50 to 100 mm of floor.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of the situation due to the spread of tropical rain.
It would be very unwise to place a dog in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Strong rain can change the cannons into the roots of the river, and they will bring local winds and dust into the air.
The nearby low-air pressure area will bring local rain to the southern part of California.
It is possible to drop more than 12 mm, which may result in a decrease in the distance from the surface and the sides of the road.
This will be the first rain for the region in the rain period.
Some scattered tropical clouds will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and Monday morning, late Monday and on Tuesday the rains will spread.
A mighty cloud will spread over all the surface of the sky in the torrent, and it will remain in the midst of them.
In October, in the United States, large temperatures can rise, as the Arctic cools and tropical winds remain too warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
The week is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the middle of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there are 20 different levels.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and re-examine.
Most of the medium and east US will enter the summer of October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to the part of the north-west.
In New York, we could have 27 °C, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a good possibility for temperatures above the middle of the U.S. east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Bretta Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people have watched an interesting fourth talk on the six television networks by Bretta Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual attack to which he should come in the 1980s.
While the political battle continued, the television stations stopped the regular program due to Friday's processing in the last minute: the agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI will conduct a single-unit investigation.
The court told the court that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had taken her in a guilty state and tried to get her to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in the burning story that he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that on Friday more than 20.4 million people would have seen the talk.
The company is a number of average television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that were predicated, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network networks.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the protection of viewers who watch the program in the offices.
For a simple presentation, the audience is similar to those in the preparation of the final finish race or the award of the American Film Academy award.
Fox News Channel television, which leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, in the preparation of a full-time hearing of water in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
On the other hand, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, 2.94 million NCBs and CNN 2,52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Interest is also high after hearing.
Flake had a central role in the fifth drama.
Following the written statement by the moderate Republican that he would vote in front of Kavanugh, the CNN and CBS television networks were followed by protestors shouting at him when he tried to enter the castle in order to participate in the hearing of the Justice Committee.
During the playing, he added a few minutes to the view that CNN's live TV cameras were in the living room.
"I stand here before you," said a woman to him.
"You think he's telling the truth of the country?
You have the power, while many women are weak."
Flake said his office gave a statement, and he added that he would give more information at the hearing of the committee, and then the door was shut.
All television networks were also distributed in the living hours later when the Justice Committee voted in favour of the nomination of Kavanaugh in the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do this if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the complaint against the candidate in the next week, to which the minority party called.
Flake's conversation with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was determined, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes for the appointment of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May criticized the "playing political games" criticism of Brexit
The President Theresa May, in an interview for Sunday Times, criticized her plans for the European Union's "playing political games" with the UK's future and raising national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her in the headline, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit Plan and said that it was a proposal for Britain and the EU to pay the rent of another 'overly absurd'.
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytenon Simpson, suspected of killing an LSU team player
The police arrested the suspect in a judicial shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU team treasurer.
After reporting from Baron Rouge's police, the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for murder at the second level.
Officials published a video of the encounter between Simms and Simpson and the police indicated that during the war, Sims lost his sunglasses.
The police found the sunglasses on the scene and on their Simpson DNA, CBS television complements WAFB's TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police reported that he admitted he shot Wayde to death.
The security is $350,000, the lawyer's report.
On Friday, an observer from the area of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a shot wound in the neck.
The police are grateful for the assistance of the investigation led to the arrest of refugees from the Lao state police, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the South University police and the residents of the area.
The LSU team's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the LSU basketball.
The previous season has gathered 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps in the game.
On Friday morning, LSU team coach Will Wade said that the team was "pretrened" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," said Wade.
Open your mouth and throat wide in Mexico City
Pepper, who bore the Vulcan Popocatepetl, reached the southern neighboring Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexico on Saturday not to approach the volcano, as the activity in the crater was strengthened and 183 discharges of gas and dust were recorded in 24 hours.
The Center has observed several cases of pregnancy and stroke.
Pictures on the social networks were shown in the clouds of a flood covering the windmill of cars in the vicinity of the capital city Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, following a 7.1-degree fall in September 2017 in the middle of central Mexico.
Vulcan, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in relation to catalytic separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the protesters who supported independence met with the opposing police units and joined more than a thousand people with the fish demonstrations, marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized vote on the rejection.
The group of masked separatism supporters held by the anti-circuit police units was surrounded by eggs and dyes in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded with tourists.
Later, too, there was a dispute that the police had to use pendants to stop conflicts.
Supporters of independence, who had been calling for more hours 'without forgetting, without pardon', met with protesters who support unity and shouted 'Let Spain live!'.
According to local media reports, 40 people in the protests received more damage.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was marked by illegality in Madrid, the Catalan separatists praised it, the tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although the participation was low, as the opponents of the withdrawals in a large measure voted against the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting at the regional elections in violent conflicts.
Groups supporting independence were tabled at night before the petitioners in order to prevent demonstrations and thus support the State police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another way.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said that there was no hope that Catalonia would be independent.
"Lani has experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for happiness because they could love, but now we've got it," he said.
While it is important that, despite the close winning of regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties supporting independence have seriously maintained the initiative this year, since there are many more well-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention waiting to be punished for their role in the referendum organisation and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on the phone in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by policies on both sides.
"The tension is rising," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of the year before the beginning of the trial, announced that he will be candidate for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in European elections is the best way to combat aggression in the democratic values and pressures we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men flying in the house with the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested because they had repeatedly landed in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in the Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday about 19.30 after the British summer.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the door and the building were damaged.
At some point, they should also shoot the car with a gun.
With the fate of Mengaja, Livingston won from 1:0 against Ranksos
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston has won
Livingston defeated Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in the 18th class as a coach from Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga's Star has taken care of the difference, because Gary Holt's Bridge is the same as the Hibernian Bridge in another place.
Gerrard's bridge is so unscathed in the guests in the annual spring, and the next week, Hearts is waiting for them to drive to the forest and for which they remain behind eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
While Livingston increased his degree of infertility in the division at six paces and the chief coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted the wound.
Livingston made a chance against the direct guest.
Holt's team should be running just before the summit, as many problems have been caused with its immediate approach to Rangoses.
Scott Robinson made the door, but what he sent through the door, then Alan Lithgow hit outside the door, and Craig Halkett shot through the floor with his head.
The guests left the game Rangsors, knowing that guests can be dangerous in the event of an attack.
And in this way they also came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Menga, which was shot and buried in the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the yokes, but domestic defences couldn't survive and the door Liam Kelly had no much work.
This example continued in the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos issued Kelly's defense.
Back at Rangers' Allan McGregor shot Scott Pittman with his leg, and at Lithgow, another Livingstone's interruption in the attack, he shot off the floor.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's prison area, but the domestics refused all attacks, two crossings – Halket's crossing over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and the cross-section of the game with his hand – and the judge did not get it.
«Excellent performance» Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont (BC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A great show and a result for Livingston.
It was clear that they were all great and still beyond expectations on their way up.
The lot of games and becomings has not changed much from their return to the top, but Holt should be credited with the way he woke up the team from his arrival.
There was a lot of Yunakov.
Captain Halkett had an extremely important role and well organized a well-organized defence, while Menga was always in the preparations for Connorja Goldson and Joe Worrall.
At the same time, Ranksos simply lacked hope.
Although Gerrard's leadership is exceptional, these standards are very low.
There was a lack of bullets on the floor – only once they successfully defeated the customer's defense – and this is some building for Rangers, which they found in the middle of the forest.
Erdogan was adopted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met at the morning in Berlin, they took over the music and the sound of the sky.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between Nat's allies.
There has been a debate on human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish approach to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new museum.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish residents outside Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 heads of police prevented the collection before the bridge, but a number of supporters were able to get closer to see their president.
It also expressed its opinion that more than a hundred protesters – including many Kurds – who do not support the Government of Erdogan and condemned Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to salute him in the country.
Controversial protests reflect bickering about visitors who some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others prefer to be an authorate.
A road accident in Deptford: the coach died on the race with the car
In London, the college died at a race where a car was involved.
The accident took place near the crossing between the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford on the south-west of the city about 10.15 after the British summer.
The driver stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the end of the accident.
The accident took place just a few months after the train died in a race where the driver ran away, which was on the Childers Street street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
The police said that the police were checking the identity of the man so they could inform their own.
They set up road arrests and moved bus lines, and they advised the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in a mine
Six prison guards were injured in an explosion in a strictly protected male prison, reported from the prison administration.
Nerd broke into the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30 after the British summer and still happens.
Police specialists from the "Tornado" unit were called to provide for the building in which he works with eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
No less damage to the face was done to the viewers alone.
The prisoner's representative said: "We have specifically called a qualified person who will provide for the imprisonment of the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six members suffered damage.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for it and that they may be longer for solutions."
In the HMP Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous perpetrators of criminal acts in the country.
In June, he was reported to be a prison manager in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October, they called an anti-circuit police unit, which had been transferred to a severe earthquake in which people were attacked with billiard bells.
Orkan Rosa fears Phéonizu, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this will probably happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining energy of the Rosa Organ is going to reach the south of the desert and brings the danger of sudden floods.
The National Time Service has already issued a warning against the sudden floods and storms to western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa would have to get up over Phoenix in the truck, and he'd be up late Monday with the rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix wrote in a tweet that only “ten tropical cycles have preserved the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950!
The Orkan Katrina (1967) is a good 60 km from the Arizona border.’
The latest models of the national centre for oranges provide 50 to 100 mm of cotton with individual floorings up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, can be expected from 25 to 50 mm, individual floorings can be up to 100 mm.
In the area outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Organ Ross may be a blessing because the region has suffered drought.
Although the waters are very serious, some rainwater will likely be useful, as the dry season is currently taking place in the south.
"As stated by the U.S. Center for the follow-up of drought, 40 percent of Arizona’s good experience is at least a rare drought," reports weather.com.
The source of the Rosa Organ first leads to the head of the Mexican Peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of hurricanes at the highest wind speed of 137 kilometres per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The drought comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and thus weakens.
It is expected that the land in Mexico will be reached with the power of tropical storms on Monday or Sunday.
The floods in parts of Mexico can be severe and therefore pose a serious threat to the waters.
"From the mid-Baj California to the north-west of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of floor with a possibility 250 mm of floor," they reported on the site weather.com.
The Orcan Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early morning hours in the truck as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and south Utah until late night in the truck.
"The greatest danger we expect from the Rosa Organ or his remains is the severe rain on the Bay California Peninsula in the northwestern part of Sonore and in the South-West of America," said the National Centre for Orcans.
These floods can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and earthquakes in mountain regions.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three seniors and 20-year-old men were arrested for the sum of the attempted deaths after they found 16-year-olds in Somerset.
The wounded guest was found in the Excellence Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4.00 after the British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remained “stable”.
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in Radstock's area, reported to the police from Avona and Somerset.
The police are calling all those who might have picked up the event by cell phone.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh was a "peer of hostility and jealousy" of democratic parties
"The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against intolerance and unheard of tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at the holding in Weheling in West Virginia.
The trumpet said that Kavanaugh was "long-lasting inadmissibility and jealousy" democratic parties in the process of naming themselves.
Kavanaugh spoke before the convention on Thursday, in which he clearly and emotionally ignored Christine Blasey Ford's complaint that she was sexually attacked ten years ago when they were the youngest.
At the hearing, she also told Ford about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's brightness, quality and enthusiasm".
"The vote on the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal concepts of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional public service record," said many supporters in West Virginia.
The President directly mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the voluntary participation of the Republicans in interlocutory elections.
"For five more weeks to one of the most important wishes of our lives.
I really work with the candidate," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The troops claim that they are democracies on the mission of 'killing and stopping'.
The first key procedural vote in the Kavanaugh nomination Senate should take place on Friday at the latest, for CNN, told the councillor of the Republican parties.
In the Indonesian persecution and tsunami of more than a hundred people, the number of victims is increasing
In Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, bringing in huge waves that were floating along the coast.
More than a hundred people gathered on Friday at the festival on the beach in the city of Pala, when six - foot - long [5 m] waves hit the coast and led many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami's been following a 7.5-step attack.
"When tsunamis were threatened yesterday, people left on the beach and did not get away immediately, so they became victims," the representative of the Indonesian emergency relief agency of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a meeting in Jakarti.
"Cunami didn't come by myself, he drove cars, trees, houses, all on the ground," explained Nugro and added that he traveled by sea at 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
He said some people went to the trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
Air photographs published by the accident agency indicate destroyed buildings and shops, damaged and damaged bridges, and the bridge, treated with water.
In Saturday, the sun still went over the coastal area.
In an area of 2.4 million people have experienced some sort of stress.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released in the five mighty blasts was approximately 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb power in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of the long and hard seas, should further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “absolute” and said that more than a thousand homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims found shelters under the ruins of the building, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be greater than 300 km north of Paluja, in the area of Donghea, which is closer to the epicenter of persecution.
As Nugro said, communications have been completely interrupted and have no information from the Donghe area.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that people and volunteers are displaced in the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can become even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, since the public did not announce that the tsunamis hit Palau, but officials say the waves came right at the time of the release of the warning.
At the amateur video published on social networks, it is heard that men in the upper surface shout a warning of people on the street in nearby shadows.
Within a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and carried the buildings and cars with it.
In Reutes, they could not immediately confirm the presence of the video.
Posts and tsunamis have caused an electric explosion that has interrupted communication around Paluja, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
The authorities report that the military started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but refugees still need food and other basic living needs.
The city airport was open only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo should visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian tsunami grew to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Asbes, members of the World Vision organization from Donghe had safely arrived in Pala, where the workers at the court were stationed in front of their premises, but on the way they saw a number of demonstrations of relaxation.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with great experience did not allow access to Palu.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, cross-border financing, storage and assistance of personnel shall be allowed only if the city is declared a disaster for the national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"We are still treated as an accident at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national accident', we can accept international assistance, but that's not the situation yet."
The second night after Friday's riot and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing are hoping that their closest miracles are in the sad history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was picked up from the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was two days pregnant under the debris, and her mother lay dead.
Gendon Subandon, a trainer of the Indonesian nuclear power plant, trained two nuclear ballasts for the Asian games that ended in the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Second, to get to Roa Roa Roa's hotel, they were after Mr. Mandissa's students.
"As an elder in the field of nuclear disarmament, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours when the news of the destruction of Roa Roa's hotel passed through the community of nuclear bombers, he sent messages to the application of WhatsApp fighters in Paluja, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one blue key, instead of two blues.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Dads stole $26,750 while filling the banknotes in the center of Newport on the Level
According to the Newport police report, the dads stole $26,750 from the Brink's security service at Newport on the Leeve centre on Friday.
The driver of the car was empty in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver money, wrote in a public statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy.
While he was employed, another man was 'closed to the Brink's employed security service from behind' and stole the cash for delivery.
The reports showed that more suspects had been expelled from the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the event.
All who have information on the identity of suspects should call the Newport police on numbers 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name in Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – in Ye.
The amendment was sent to Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote: «Bitja with the official name Kanye West».
The 41-year-old West has a bit of a set of time and has also used it for the title of his eight-year-old album, which was released in June.
The change comes right before his arrival at the Saturday Night Live event, in which to present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the giant Ariano Great, who has responded to the "special reasons" by saying the Creator of the award.
The word is abbreviation of his current professional name, and West has already said that he has a word of religious significance.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning 'you' (sl. ti),' said West at the beginning of this year when he spoke to the radio host Big Boye about the title of the album.
"So I am you and I am all of you.
Kanya, which means "one", I changed to Ye – it reflects our good, our weakness, our confusion, everything.
The album is the reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a wish by the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West's partner, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without his idea and with great scars.
The Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the military against civilians
The newly elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, just as the nation nears 50 years of blood violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Plaza market that "he will never use the military to stop the Mexican people."
When a left-wing student movement began to operate in Latin America, on October 2, 1968, the soldiers started shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations on the market.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education lead young people to criminal society.
The United States should double the financing of artistic intelligence
Since the Chinese became more active in the field of art intelligence, the United States should double the resources it uses for research in this area, the real investor and expert for the artistic intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the American government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan: their goal is to become the best in innovations in the field of art intelligence by 2030.
"Seconding the budget for research on art intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are very much for the United States and we are looking for the next step in the field of art intelligence," Lee said.
The allocation of funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artistic intelligence would take place in the United States, Lee told CBC in the interview this week.
Lee, Čegar book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Supersle Art Intelligence: China, Siliciva Dolina and New World Order) was released this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, president of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible art intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an art intelligence system that won the highest rank in the American game player Othello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese company Googla.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous technological competitions of the American government, such as the competition in the robotics organized by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and asked when the next time he would find the next winner.
Researchers in the United States must work hard if they want to receive state aid, Lee said.
"It's not China's one who takes the best academics, but it's the company," Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working best with the university in recent years to develop artistic intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artistic intelligence.
"I think that people with a doctor from art intelligence should automatically offer a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artistic intelligence of the new generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is weaker, explained Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the US Ministry of Defence has established a Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which combines partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House has announced the establishment of a tough artistic intelligence committee.
This month, the DARPA agency announced investment in the AI Next initiative in the amount of two billion dollars.
The National Scientific Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million dollars per year in research on artistic intelligence
While the American legislation she wanted to create the National Security Commission for Art Intelligence, she did nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide at the referendum on the change in the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday at the referendum whether their country's name would be changed to the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would then resolve the ten long-term dispute with Greece that opposed their request for membership in the European Union and Natu.
Greece, which has its province on behalf of Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and has placed a pledge on its entry into Nato and the EU.
In June, the governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign of the fighters expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 per cent, as long as it was necessary to apply the referendum.
The question on the referendum list was, ‘Are you for a membership in Natu and the EU with the adoption of a agreement with Greece?’
The rapporteurs, including the President of the Government of Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price it deserves to be paid for joining bodies such as the EU and Nato, for Macedonia, one of the countries that came after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely within the framework of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament acted to respect the outcome of the vote that will be decided.
A change of name requires a double majority in Parliament.
The National Voluntary Commission has notified that no irregularities have been reported by 13 hours.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted out.
"I have come to love for my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a senior bishop of Skopje.
Macedonian President Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and son Dosko, gave their votes to the referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on the change in the name of the country that would open the way to the accession of Natu and the European Union.
Before parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small one or set up a table in front of the speakers who set up those who were going to fight the referendum.
"We're for Nato and the EU, but we want to join with the dwindling heads, not through the last door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
President Zaev says that the Member State in Natu will make a very necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe there will be a large majority because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and Nato," Zaev said after giving his volunteer list.
He added that it would be a positive result of "the realization of our future".
The survey published by the Macedonian policy research institute on Monday shows that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the necessary voluntary participation.
A second survey conducted by the Macedonian television Telma showed that 57% of the respondents would like to be asked on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for them.
For the referendum to succeed, the voluntary participation must be 50 % plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first real hit on the policy of the Western Government, which took over the mandate of May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has won the entire Bridgeton defense and defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took part on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, in the Battle of Brighton at Manchester City from 2 to 0.
Aguero's case in 65 minutes was seen ridiculously simple.
Argentinian attacker accepted the mid-playing data at the beginning of the action.
He walked between three Brighton's defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played a defense player and was faster than anyone else at Brighton's prison.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
The English attacker, with his first touch in the prison area, returned to Joo Aguera, who, with his right leg, defeated Brighton's porter Matthew Ryan and sent it to the right side of the network.
"Aguero copes with foot problems," said the coach of the City of Pep Guardiola.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were happy that he was buried naked at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the blue blues the initial advantage in the first English league.
Gol arrived in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took a deep breath at the Brighton's half.
He gave Leroy Sane on the left-hand side.
Sane once touched the jars, and then sent a jar of Starling against a remote gate.
The blue-eyed attacker was putting a hole in the net just before she flew out of the hole.
The city will meet with Hofffenheim in a group of the League of Firsts at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday, 12.55.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and destroy them for the title
The Nationals team has finally emerged, so there is no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to join the Greek against the Colorado Rockies team. This will happen only if Rockies still have the chance to play in the end, because they have a preference game in the West League before the Los Angeles Doggers team.
Rockies won 5:2 on Friday at the Nationals team provided at least an invitation to the organizers, but they still wait for their first title in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we will be able to play in a great vision before a large crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level of the year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal in the week, but it is likely to be in this case that metal Scherzer will.
Scherzer, who will be the first of the 34-year-old metal, is in the fourth metal as a discrepancy player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington right-winger collected this season 18 shots and 7 hits with an average of 2,53 and 300 hits in 220 2/3 variables this season.
Tours in West Virginia
The President directly affected the situation with regard to his election to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican voluntary participation in interlocutors.
"All we've done will be on the rock in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really strive with a candidate, so I fight for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
The trumpet continued: "We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening right now.
They are determined to re-examine the area where all possible resources will be used. You can see shame, shame.
They have all the power and authority to do whatever they want, but we will not give them."
According to his words, democracies are on the mission of "smoking and stopping".
"And you can observe this in the last four days," he said, and the Democrats marked as "sneaking, bad, low and lying."
A member of the Justice Committee, democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, was nominated, and a vote was heard from the city.
"Remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait. It was really a bad talk of the body, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The lab page is no longer open for different views.
Those who express their views are impatient.
When Momentum's activist in my local page told me that there was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of the members of parliament from the Laburist Party, which we do not wish to express my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has done something like this because she's been firmly exposed to antisemitism.
In my case, it went on to propose an inconsistencies for my disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy has not dealt with with the previous leaders.
In the communication for the fifth meeting of the Nottingham East, it was stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In eight years, as a member of the parliament of the local labyrinth parties, the five meetings were most precisely like that.
Most of the meetings today do not apply such a tone and promise of a 'more friendly and less' policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has even started.
It is always more obvious that different views on the lab page are not allowed and is considered to be acceptable for the guidance of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues to whom I had previously thought to share similar political views were expected of me to change my opinion and take a position that would never have been in line with – to do so in the area of national security or the single EU market.
When I speak publicly – and, in fact, it is not important to say what I say – that the criticisms on social networks that call for non-commissioning are distorted by the media policy and they tell me not to be in the labyrinth.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I have more happiness than some of my colleagues, because they are comments to me, just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet daily with the flood of sexy or racist sorrows, but they are not afraid.
One of the greatest regrets of the valuable aspects of this period of policy is how the level of abuse has become quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that a labyrinth must promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with each proposal of uncertainty or change of rules for the choice of the party becomes more difficult.
In the last two years, I have received much advice to turn my head off and not to be so loud, and it will be “all right” with me.
But I didn't get involved in politics because of that.
After I joined the labist party 32 years ago, which was why the Tatcher government's smallness, which caused the teacher in my primary school to break down gradually, I was a local priest or a government minister trying to take on more public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political convictions, including recent elections.
No one on Nottingham East could be confused because of my political positions and areas that I did not agree with with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I don't understand their wishes after spending time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leadership of the labyrinths during the time when the state is going to fight the brexity that will affect the communities, businesses and our public services.
But my right message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the labyrinth parties or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat after election or political opportunity will turn me away from it in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unprepared Ayr on top of last hand
Two well-known attempts have been several times the final result, but no doubt, Ayr has earned the victory in this wonderful first-time race of days.
Now they're on the top of the forest and they're the only unarmed team of ten.
At the end, the weight on the home side exceeded their upper defenses and the better use of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had good reason for satisfaction.
"In our current issues, we have stopped many trials and we are still not prepared, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Happy Ayra teams, opportunities have been used better than we have."
The subject of Grant Anderson, who was transformed by Frazier Climo in 14 minutes, led by Ayr, but the Romanian card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who took him into the game with the Warriors, referred to a number of forces for Melrose and Jason Baggott, who went through the trials without conversion.
The climate has increased the leadership for Ayr, just before he died in the afternoon, and then turned into a self-test for the result 17:5 for Ayr on the move.
But Melrose started a very good second half, and Patrick Anderson, who turned it into Baggot, reduced the remainder to five points.
She was followed by a long interruption due to the serious injuries of Ruridha Knotta, which had been carried on her noses, and after continuing Ayr continued with the trial of Stafford McDowall, who turned it into Climo.
Temporary Captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a Romanian card and Melrose again used the game with the player more with an unconstitutional attempt by Bruce Colvinea at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the guests returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a Romanian card due to climate-free blocking, MacPherson was attacked by the attack.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's guardian in five attempting guests.
Still Game series star starts a new career in the guest
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is obviously placed in the guesthouse, unless he should be the director of the licensed company with restaurants.
56-year-old in a favorite BBC series for which he also wrote a scenario, the game of Jack Jarvis with a long-term partner in Greg Hemphill's comedy.
Two reported that after the next nine seasons, Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Crailang.
According to the official documentation, the director of the Adymorn Limited Company.
The player didn't want to comment on the story, but the source for Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan wanted to join the "citizen hospitality" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling at the station of the Navy in La Paz.
At public buildings, the sea blue flag has been removed.
The coastal bases from Lake Titika to Amazon are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In the whole of Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in the bloody conflict is still alive because of natural resources with Chile in the 19th century, such as the burial after the invasion of the Pacific.
This hope is perhaps the biggest in decades now, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be held after five years of consultation on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a desire, a spirit of unity and impartiality and of course in a positive spirit awaits the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The number of Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on the large seats by the State and trust that the Hague Court will decide in front of Bolivia, which is supposed to be – after decades of inconsistencies – to negotiate the access of Bolivia to the sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, a Bolivian charismatic domestic president, who is waiting for a controversial re-election battle next year, has also had a lot of expectations about Sundays.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the courts will not decide in front of Bolivia – and even if it were, it would not change much.
The UN body, with its seat in the Netherlands, has not authorized Bolivia to allocate the Chilean territory, nor will it decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the final arguments have been heard means that the case has been 'not implemented', said Paz Zárate, a civil expert on international law.
And in the last four years, they don't speak in front of Bolivia, but maybe they'll have a lot to do with it.
"The current disease government has used the issue of access to the sea," Zárateev said.
Morales' aggressive retrieval of Chilen's entire good will, which may have remained, has explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some points, but then it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The States have not changed the Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in Haagu, rejected the idea that the court had taken a decision immediately.
On Monday, Bolivia will provide "a unique opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end of 139-year differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also ignored that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political defense.
"Bolivia will never deny its rights to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to make sure that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea stated that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never destroy their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri had a speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States has invited them to fulfil their commitments made to meet the leaders of the fishing countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when American Minister Mike Pompeo is apparently before the re-enactment of nuclear diplomacy, which was at the point of death, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Uno in Singapore.
Ri says that the United States is motivated if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the contract will result in the end of the Korean war in North Korea.
Washington was warned of the claim, without first taking decisive measures to expose Pjongjang.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, it is generally argued that Pjongjang thinks seriously about the refusal of a weapon that the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjongjanga next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kima and Trump.
On the fashion magazines in Paris, the latest line of huge coverages coming into trade with price-free brands in your neighborhood
If you want to complete your collection of cover or hide yourself before the sun, you don't need to keep looking.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne, in their youth collections and in the summer of 2019, discovered a collection of wonderful ceilings that covered the floor in Paris's weekly fashion.
It was very ineffective to cover this summer that the Instagram was flooded, and the designer sent their spectacular creations to the fashion gun.
Valentin's hair, which was the best that came out, was a clump in a plain color with wide edges, decorated with sand-like additions in which the heads of models were completely lost.
The second large blue supplements included the caps with precious stones, magic hats and even pineapples – but your heads won't burn.
Thom Browne also showed the choice of weird masks – exactly the right time for the night of the priest.
A lot of colorful masks have lips covered and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashions.
One creature was similar to that of amber and eyes, and the other was seen as a crown with a degree of ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashions, you're lucky.
The fashion designers predict that large-scale coverings will come close to you.
The broad clasps closely follow "La Bombi", the slamming clasp with 60-centimetre ends were observed on Rihanni and Emily Rattakowski.
A cultural sign for an extremely ineffective blockade that was overflewed by the social network was sent by the fashion bridge to another large creation — a broken beach bag, which was almost as big as a maniac in the trunks she wore.
The la Riviera collection center of the Jacquemusa collection was held in Paris in the mid-week fashion.
The famous artist Luke Armitage told the F.D.: "I expect large beaches and beach bags to contribute to the next summer's trade – because the manufacturer made such a powerful push, the demand for too much supplements would be difficult to overcome."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a key factor for global citizens
The Scottish schools themselves enjoy the words of academic excellence, and this also continued in 2018 with the same series of exceptional results on exams, which still strengthen individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other effort-making communities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland attending these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Schools Council (SCIS), they strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Self-study schools want their students to prepare for further and higher education, selected careers and places that they have as global citizens.
As the education sector that can shape and implement an adjusted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, he will be touched by the memory.
If you speak to a man in his mother's language, his words will reach his heart."
This is a good reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The annual results of recent studies show that languages at the top of the forest are at the highest levels of success in self-sustaining schools.
68 percent of the students who have learned foreign languages have been well evaluated.
The data collected in the 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Schools (SCIS) showed that 72% of the students had achieved a great score in Mandarin, and 72% of the German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students had received excellent evaluations.
This proves that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a selective object in the educational plans of schools and others are treated as objects in the fields of nature, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 study carried out by the Commission on Employment and Training of the United Kingdom showed that the reasons why workers are suffering in order to fill free jobs, 17 per cent of which we describe the lack of knowledge of languages.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
For future employment opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are of major importance in the world.
If someone learns another language, he has a great privilege in the future regardless of the professional course he has chosen.
A majority of persons who can deal directly with people from other countries have an automatic advantage against competition.
The 2013 YouGov survey, involving more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with French being the only language spoken by the two-thirds of the respondents, is 15 percent.
That is why input into language learning is important for children today.
With the knowledge of more languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Schools in Scotland vary in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others learn languages that will be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, you will always be able to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field at school.
Scotland's private schools are devoted to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need for success, regardless of what the future will bring.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as ‘international communication skills’.
Self-study schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be a week in San Diego debitral in Lakers' dress
For lovers who rejoice in LeBron James's first appearance of the Los Angeles Lakers Bridge, waiting will be over soon.
Coach Lakers' Luke Walton announced that James will play in a Sunday's introduced match against the Denver Nuggets Museum in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48," explained Walton on the official website of Lakers' Museum.
The official reportant of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James asked about his plans for the six Lakers race before the season.
"At this stage, I do not need a race before the season," he said.
Trump collection in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia starts a series of events in his campaign.
This is the first of the five meetings planned in the following week, including the arrivals in the affected countries, between Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a simple seat at the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to receive support for upcoming interlocutory elections, as the Republican is at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's collection in West Virginia be, and where will you be able to watch it online?
The assembly in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held on Saturday, 29 September 2018 at 19 a.m. after sunrise.
Trump collection in West Virginia can be seen alive online on YouTube channel.
The Tempp will probably talk about hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh this week, which became tense because of the sexual harassment charges, which led to the expectation that the signature in the Senate would be suspended for one week to conduct the investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, to gain a new momentum.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trumpa, these five meetings were meant "to encourage volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority of those who have it in the Senate and the representative home, reports Reuters.
"The control at the Congress is so important for its programme that the president of the campaign will travel to as many countries as possible as possible," said the representative of Trump's campaign, which does not want to be named.
Today's collection at the centre of Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania after reporting West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
In Saturday, Trump will be visiting West Virginia twice in the last month, in which he received more than 40 per cent of the item in 2016.
The Tempp is trying to help the Republican candidate for a Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in public research.
"For Morrisey, it is a weak sign that the president must come and "develop him" in public research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University in West Virginia.
Ryderev's 2018 round: US team has a desire to win and keep hope in front of Sunday's private debates
After three international games, there may have been just a Saturday afternoon's double (foursome) thing that Ryder needed.
Although it is not always an ideal sports concept, players really believe in the outside, especially in such competitions.
So where did it not go now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, because it leads to four points, and it can still get twelve points.
But the Americans, according to Spieth's words, feel that they have wind in the yards, in addition to encouraging them, the form of Spietha and Justin Thomas, who played all day together and each won three points from four.
Spieth was condemned from the beginning to the green and gives a good example.
The cracks of luck continued to become more louder and came to a decisive impact when Thomas, after the two-point match was finished in the fourth game.
The strike that won them on July 15th was a similar crash, so that you know we can believe that the American team still has the opportunity.
"You just need to find your inner power and focus on your game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left of this player now.
18 lavender to glory.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of Ryder's wedding.
It is unusual, but the overwhelming two Europeans have won four points from four and are not wrong.
The two ‘Molliwood’ were the only one who did not hit the Bugi on Saturday afternoon, and the Bugi also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine lights on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which it is obviously spent energy between them and the botanical society, confirms the fact that these are the players that will have to overcome it on Sunday, and no other player would be better able to secure the potential winnings of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes over the Le Golf National player.
On the other hand, it's possible both on different angles.
However, talking about the glory of Europe would be a shame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson won Sergia Garcio, tomorrow's hero in the game with four jogs, who were in a couple with Alex Noren.
Because of the bungies and two double bungies in the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they found no way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
The games with four joggs and two pairs are extremely interesting to follow closely because of the communication between couples, the advice you give them, the advice you do not give them, and the way in which the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a great advantage before the last day, but the two of them have shown that the U.S. team also wants to win, some of which, especially on the American side, have doubled.
Europe runs 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's bed
Europe's final day of Ryder's wedding is a good priority after the Saturday games with four joggs and two two waters from 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple who make up Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari gave each of them all and with two victories over Tiger Woods and on the Le Golf National game he spent four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophies lost two years ago in Hazeltina, had a four-year-old weight over the American team that was wrong and said below 3:1.
The U.S. team was better engaged in two fights, where they won two games, but the rest couldn't win.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from 12 Sundays of private doubles if they want to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European journalist who won four consecutive points while with Molinari (a couple called Mollinwood) after the sedentary end of the week only another couple who won four points in their first four games in Ryder's story.
After the victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four jogs, they again appeared and were even more confident of winning the spent Woods and American newspaper Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who drove through two games on Saturday, at the moment showed his brightness, but he lost 19 out of 29 games in two with four joggs and two pairs of two, from this seven order.
Justin Rose, who was represented for the morning of the game with four jogs, came back for two and a couple with Henrik Stanson with 2 and 1 wounded Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were assigned to the first and third place in the world forest.
But on a friendly, winding day in the southern part of Paris, it wasn't all about the European team's plans.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for Americans on Saturday with two points.
From 2 and 1 they won a decisive victory against Spain's Jon Rahm and Jana Poulter in the game with four jogs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two, with the first two holes lost.
Only once in Ryder's story did the team come back after the rest of the four points before the private debate, although Fury's team needs only surprise to save the trophie.
But after two days on the other side of the city, the weekly raid may seem too much for her.
North Korea: "Without confidence we will never be united"
In Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continued implementation of the sanctions would lead to a growing distrust in the United States of America and that North Korea would certainly not refuse its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has adopted a number of "important measures in the mark of good will" such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, support for nuclear testing and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in state security and under such conditions we will never be the first to be united."
While Ri reiterates the known complaints of North Korea in response to Washington's gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, including that North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of procedural measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject the ethnic nuclear disarmament as in the past did Pjongjang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim John Una and Donald Trumpa from the first floor between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leadership that took place in Singapore on June 12th. At the time, Kim committed himself to "the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump North Korea promised security.
North Korea wants the official end of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has acted that Pjongjang must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not accept the call to release the strong international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The United States insists that we have to put nuclear disarmament first and push pressure on sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and also even make the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"When you think the sanctions could get us on the knees, it's about the unrealistic hope of people who don't even know us.
The problem is that the continued implementation of the sanctions still deepens our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the president of the United States presented to the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
On the contrary, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun J. Inno, who had been away in the past five months, and added: "If we had talked to South Korea and not the United States about nuclear disarmament problems, the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have reached such a dead spot."
Nevertheless, the tone of Rijega’s speech was quite different from that of the former when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the US cell part of North Korean rockets was inevitable, after "Mr. Trump Kim's vice president" marked "the rocket husband" on the suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim and his effort to take the disarmament measures, but said that he was still waiting for much more work and that the sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is nuclearly disarmed.
In the middle, Trump said that there was no time frame for this, and he said: "It may take two years, three years or five months – that is not important."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should pay Pjongjang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, in the fourth US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the UN Security Council, he said: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue without exception until we recognize the complete, complete and verifiable state of nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent financing of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with Riym at the General Assembly of the United Nations and later said that Pjongjang would come back next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but his last visit has not ended well.
When he left Pjongjang in July, he said that he had made progress, and North Korea had criticised him for a few hours, so that his demands would be "gangster".
North Korea was engaged in a meeting with Mun, which took place this month, to be supported by a rocket test and a nuclear test infrastructure if the United States took ‘appropriate measures’.
It should be said to Kim that the "appropriate measures" meant the security security guaranteed by Trump in Singapore and the measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University visit the course to learn how to take enough time to relax
The goal of the New Year's course at Harvard University is to teach all secondary students how to get more sleep. With this course they want to fight against the growing artistic culture of the "cellonic" learning, where the powers are involved with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best universities often do not know the basis for their own concerns.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, formed a course that was his first type in the United States.
In order to implement such a course, he decided after his teaching on the impact of the lack of space on learning.
At the end of the class, the girl approached him and said, “Why do I do this just now when I'm in the last year?”
She said that no one told her how important it was to Spanish, and for the journal The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it was surprising.
The course they are taking this year talks about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sport, as well as for improving the overall feeling of good.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University of Health Services, says that for such a course, they decided when they found that the student had a significant lack of Spanish during the week.
The one-year course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a student’s home door where students can click on coffee boxes, candles, sports shoes and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second section, participants shall report that long-term lack of Spanish may increase the risk of heart failure, brain failure, depression and cancer.
The landscape of student settlements with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are sorry that the conduct of students will not change immediately.
And we think that they have the right to be informed about these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that pride culture is still present with "lived lifelong learning". It also adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of space, poses growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that sufficient amounts of quality jumpers should be “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also be avoided by getting more weight – the potential resulting from lack of spinach is easily passed, which makes students less vulnerable.
A 19-year-old California student of the chemistry and physics biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler to form a course. Lani participated in a professor's lecture during the first year of his career in Harvard.
He says that giving opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a course throughout the student community.
It is hoped that in the next phase, sub-group students will be able to request the completion of a similar study programme before they enter into a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends to students that they continue to sleep a little while as well as to wake up. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of the "moderate light" that give them electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause the imbalance of the circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 With the last poppy up Gerardov team
Rangers repatriated in the guest: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared team Steven Gerrard condemned for defeat with 1 :0.
The team from Ibroxa has been catching its first guest victory after the February ruling at the St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but the team Gary Holt has given it a second break in 18th, since it's at the head of the team Gerrard, with his team for the leading team of the Scottish League team remaining 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the launch of the first half, and the selected type of Rangers didn't give a hint that he wanted to get rid of it.
With this, Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingston advanced to a third place, but with different heads, the Hibernian team remained.
The difficulty of Rangers' problem with this has not been over. Calum Spence, a foreign judge, suffered head injuries when he was reported out by an item from the city of the visiting crew.
Gerrard was in his position, who won Ayr without any trouble, and was placed in the semifinals of Betfred Cup, making eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt kept a check on Livingstone's esoteric, which took the Hearts team a week earlier, and was no doubt excited about how his team was effectively neutralizing all the guests' attempts.
I mean, Rangers had a higher presence, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the first time Menga was first introduced to Scott Pittman, then he went to the top of Allan McGregor, but he was involved in the execution of an undisclosed and wrong opportunity.
The simple fire of Keaghan Jacobs was then reached by Captain Craig Halketta, but his defense assistant Alan Lithgow was unable to get into the hole after that.
In the last three years, Rangers has taken over control, but the game has shown more hope than they really want to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite confident that after a 15-minute race with Steven Lawless, he would have had to get a criminal gun, but Judge Steven Thomson's request for Columbia to be shot in the car.
In the first half of his life, he managed to assemble only two bullets on the floor, but he didn't shoot with his head that sent him against the naked Lassan Coulibaly, nor the sweet yellow of Ovie Ejaria, nothing for the doorkeeper Liam Kelly presented any danger.
Livingstone's initial goal in 34 minutes may have been surprising, but it has already been fully deserved for sustainability.
Rangeshos failed to detect another Jacob's long-term follow-up.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the grain to Scott Robinson, who had prepared Mengi routinely for the simple end of the attack.
Gerrard took action and during the vacation, Coulibaly replaced the screen player Ryan Kent, who immediately appeared with the offer of Morelos, but Kelly effectively stepped out of his line and blocked the attack.
At the same time, Livingstone continued in his work and the guests moved into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett cared for more items before the floor.
The Holt team could still increase against the end of the lead race, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was unanticipated after the data from the cave.
In Rangershes, Glenn Middleton won the final match for a criminal shooting after his encounter with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't recognize him.
Almanah: Immigrants of Geigerje's Count
We represent the German side of our Sunday edition: September 30, 1882, so today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany, who later became world famous physics.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of the device called Geiger's number.
In the scientific world, he became a star, and he also got his place in pop culture, said in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are playing the cowboy scientist:
Men: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's number. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you hit the ear, you can just hear the effect it has on atomic radioactivity in materials."
Evans: "Madonca, they're really advertising now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
Isomy with his name, and he lives on.
New cancer vaccines can be identified by the immune system.
New cancer vaccines can be identified and destroyed by the immune system.
The vaccine during therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attack cells
This method includes the acquisition of immunosuppressive cells of patients who have subsequently been modified into the laboratory
After this, ‘visual’ protein, which is relevant for a number of forms of cancer, may then be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which the immune system teaches to recognize the attack cells, the cancer on the eggs disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of immunosuppressive cells of patients who change them into the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is relevant for a number of cancers, then re-inject.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research from Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very rare vaccine."
HER2 ‘enforces the growth of several different types of cancers’, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung and fat cancer.
A similar approach to acquiring immunosuppressive cells of patients who ‘learn’ them to target cancer cells has also been used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West, after the launch of the SNL, made a protrumping point with the MAGA on the cap.
The population was not excited
Kanye West was highlighted in the study of the delivery of Saturday Night Live at a surprising point, during which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would be held for the presidential table.
At the end of the third song, called “Gohost Town”, during which he wore a cape with the title “Make America Great Again”, West started with an attack on democracy and reiterated his support to Trump.
"Many times it happens to talk to a white person and he says to me, "How can you like Trump, but he's a racist?"
"Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have to move out of America recently," he says.
The current SNL surrender began with a family with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood player complained of Bretta Kavanaugh's complaint to the Commission about the trial in the Senate that Christine Blasey Ford accused him of a sexual assault.
The post of West monologue was not predicated, and it was posted on the social network by the comics of Chris Rock.
It's not known, but Rock was trying to get out of West with it.
West also accused the community of having some problems in its content because of writing on the cover.
“For the children they have dealt with me.
I said, "I don't go to or with the head."
They've been watching me!
And they say I'm lost," said Washington Examiner after the report.
West continued: "Do you want to see a lost scene?" and added that you must hope "Superman's wrath, because it means that no one can show me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments prepared the audience at least twice, and the SNL team members were in a clear surprise, and someone told Vanity, "There was a death silence in the studio."
The West was invited to the exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The West has already caused a lot of surprises with the song “I Love it”, where he wore the costumes of the mineral water brand Perrier.
Westa supported Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who complained: "One of the most famous souls: Thank you for being the leader of the TPSA."
The speech director Karen Hunter testified that West is simply "what is, and that's clear.
However, I will not reward anyone (with the purchase of his music, clothing or the support of his "art"), which in my view welcomes and expands the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And I'll do that too."
Before they were handed over to Twitter, rapper announced that you changed his name and will then "beige, formally known as Kanye West. Now I'm YE."
He's not the first singer who decided to change his name before him, he's already done it, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
His local colleague Snoop Dogg once named Snoop Lion, so we can't forget another song legend: Prince changed his name in symbol, and then he was an artist, sometimes known as Prince.

A star Game of the Kit Harrington throne has been severely opposed to toxic men
Kit Harington is known for his victory of the sword in the role of Jona Snowa in HBO's exciting medieval fantasy series game table.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a masculinity hero says that it is often felt that respect can be earned only by virtue of the appearance of such role in the young boys who are underage.
Kit told the magazine The Sunday Times Culture that something went wrong, and asked how to cope with the problem of toxicity during the movement #JazTudi.
A player who recently reported with a 31-year-old soybean from the game of Rose Leslie admitted that he had strong conviction about these issues.
"I personally seriously wonder where we have made a mistake when it comes to men," he said.
"What did we teach men about the problems we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxicity due to the presence of very potential characters.
He continued: “What is nature, and what is learned?
What do they teach us on television and on the streets to make young boys feel that they have to choose a certain amount of men's wages?
I think that is one of the important questions of our time, how can we change it?
For it is evident that there were some things wrong with the young men."
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series, he would not participate in the filming of any premier or the continuation of the game table, since he ‘closed with the warrior and the horse’.
Kit will play a key role in the new exhibition of True West Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother's robbery.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the game table was that he met his wife, Rose.
"Because of this series, I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from there," he said.
Rose is in the fantasy series won by Amy, playing Ygritte, the romantic prize of Kitto's daughter, Jon Snow.
The couple reported on June 2018 on the presence of the Leslijein family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: with China's 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In many new cases, the disease has been transmitted to sexual relations, which is a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has usually spread rapidly because of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to data from the Chinese health officials at the June conference, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased almost nothing.
Still, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS continues to increase annually in China by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV to sex is a very serious problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was criminalized in 1997 in China, but discrimination in the LGBT community is still very prevalent.
Since conservative values are still in force in the country, 70–90% of men having sexual relations with men are reported to women in time.
The disease is often transmitted because of the inadequate protection of sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV therapy as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that individuals have published information on Republican senators, the scope of “hazardous lies” and “the theories of fraud”
In Saturday, the American Congressional Maxine Waters rejected the complaint that a member of her staff published information on three American Republican senators on their website in Wikipedia.
Democrats from Los Angeles have claimed that these charges come from individuals and websites of a narrow right.
"False, lie and even more unacceptable lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter statement.
The information published on this note includes domestic titles and telephone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from the Utah federal state.
These data appeared online on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during the session of the Senate on sexual harassment of a candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kanaugh.
The information was received after the three senators concluded with Kavanaugh's hearing.
Conservative Web sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, suggest that via IP addresses it is possible to recognize the source of the publication that should be linked to the office Senator Waters and conclude that information has been published by someone else, reports Hill.
"These inexplicable charges are completely wrong and pure lies" continues Waters.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false charges, are not in any way responsible for blocking these data.
These inexplicable charges are completely ineffective and pure lies.’
The statement by Senator Waters was quickly launched on the internet on criticism, including by former representative White House for the press, Arija Fleischerie.
"From this impasse of the lake,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it’s not from the real test for the Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he hasn't done, we shouldn't show him the tongue.
You can't turn around.
And we can't doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared the response of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused him of being too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate, who is at the interlocutory elections for Waters City, announced through Twitter.
"If that's true, it's true," he tweeted.
Waterss, in his statement, stated that her office announced "appropriate institutions and bodies in connection with these false charges.
"We will ensure that the workers are revealed," she continued, "and that they will respond to all the harmful and dangerous actions of every member of my staff and all of him."
Johnny English again in stock - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for targets in Brexit in which any new British film has already become traditional, and also applies to the restoration of Johnny English’s share comedy, which came first in 2003 with Johnny English’s title and the year 2011 with Johnny English’s title 2.
Is it gonna be a fun time about how we're missing, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetence Johnny English with blind eyes and unusual greys obtains permission to relocate the screens; his name suggests that it is a comical character created for a cinematographic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is for an unaccompanied secret agent, who, despite his extraordinary movement, includes part of Clouseau, the daughter of Mr. Beana and the youngest of the one who contributed to the final score of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveler and an international secret firm, which Atkinson once played in an already forgotten TV class for Barclaycard, where he left for himself the real chaos.
In the latest film, there are one or two pleasant moments.
I liked it when Johnny English got close to the helicopter, he wore a medieval hat, and the rotary lists were short-lived with his shoes.
Atkinson's comedy gift is clearly displayed, but humor seems to be a few blogs and too unnecessary, especially because "real" films such as 007 or Mission cannot now provide chemical elements without bad news.
It seems as though humor is intended for children and not so grown-up viewers, so for me to reject Johnna English's events are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's not in Mr. Bean's role.
The permanent theme is now clearly that Great Britain is in real trouble.
The online hacker has infiltrated the UK's network of most secret agents and has uncovered the identity of all British agents, causing serious problems to the competent agent, represented by Kevin Eldon in a surprising little role.
This is a premier, a poignant figure that has already experienced evil because of political intolerance: Emma Thompson has already tried with the role of the supposed Terese May, but in the scenario there is nothing that can help.
The intelligence service informs her that all active drivers are exposed, so it must be decided for one of the retired drivers.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at college who is not officially teaching how to work under the crown: the scanners are assigned here, because English is performing some kind of vocal "academia rock".
English are taking them to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where they meet with a long-term partner, Boughhom, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine, stereotyped sports fan, the role that Vicki Pepperdine has lost a little.
So Batman and Robin are prepared to create more problems in the name of the secret service of her Highness, and they meet the little Ophelio Bullet, who plays Olga Curylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: this is poor Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough tell their dress: dressed in a light-up fire in the French restaurant, created chaos when it was overheated on Volt's jacket, and when English tried to use eyes for obvious reality to meet the interior of Volt's house, he managed to create a general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sensitivity and energy it mentions in the child film.
Very medium.
Like other movies of Johnny English, I can't help and think about this: is the British film Atkinson able to play a role that actually benefits his talent?
The labs fail to plan a four-day working week for Britain, where they would receive payment for a five-day working week.
The Laburist page of Jeremy Corbina thinks of a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a payment in five days.
A leading party of the company wants the stocks created by companies due to the revolution of art intelligence to move to the workers and allow them to add a day-to-day.
So the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high pay.
The sources say that the idea corresponds to the economic plan of the parties and to the plan for the country to be based on workers.
The trade unions support the transition to the four-day working week, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the advantages of the changing economy.
A source from the Laburist Party for The Sunday Times said: 'The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen during the night, but the four-day worker is the goal we will strive to achieve with the approach of the parties to economic balance for the benefit of the workers and the general industrial strategy of the parties."
The Laburist Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the four-day working week in its campaign at general elections in 2017 was supported by the Greens Party.
This objective, however, is currently not supported by the Laburist Party as a whole.
The representative of the Laburist Party said: "The Thursday work week is not a party's policy and the party does not think about it."
Chancellor John McDonnell used the lab conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that it was decided to expel the power of 'free' and 'responsible' in municipal companies.
The plans of the Chancellor in the shadow also mean that current participants in water companies may no longer receive the full share, as the leisure partner could introduce the “reimbursement” on the basis of alleged offences.
He also endorsed the plans to involve workers in the Administrative Board and to introduce the Owning Funds, with 10 per cent of them being transferred to private companies to employees who would receive an annual dividend of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed in the introduction of '60 minutes' ('60 minutes').
The investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh, who is made by the FBI, noted the final vote on his appointment in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the authorities of any Republican senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview that was delivered on Sunday, the Secretary-General of the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could find anything that would change his opinion.
Kennedy thought it was more open than a South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugho
When I called him when this complaint came up, I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, unintended, unconvincing.’
And the sound of Graham's voice seems to be thrown into the rock.
"I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change," he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett was definitely missing, ” said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And he could not prove this to any of those whom she named
It's 36 years old.
I see no new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event where a truly exceptional kind of star has the same excellent mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by dozens of people. Many of the Central Parks will sit together not only to enjoy the events of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise interest in the real purpose of the event, namely the removal of the rare poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizens Festival is an expansion of the Global Citizens Project, an international prison group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a simple event input (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP input), the participants had to perform a sort of task or "action", such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful means of increasing awareness of their poverty eradication objective.
And how successful is Global Citizen's movement, which has been in progress for 12 more years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince them to require action, or is it just another example of so-called "clickivism" – to create the conviction that people are really important in terms of online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen’s movement indicated that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters should be noted in the effort to achieve a variety of objectives.
It is true that these actions have helped global leaders in the adoption of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which would have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Since 2018, the Group has suggested that the fruit of its 390 commitments and communications, based on which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the armed forces have now directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and decision makers committed to "helping to achieve their full potential" promised by Ruandi to provide $35 million in support of relief after they received more than 4700 tweets of Global Citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens, as you are, we can put a social burden on the historic archives,” said many at a concert in London in April 2018 by Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Moch Prehrane Partnership.
The Group also said that the government, following more than 5000 actions undertaken by the United Kingdom, called for the improvement of the mother and child, announced that it would co-finance the Power of Food project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
the Global Citizens’ Movement replied: “This will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall and we will be crushed.
But just as a large movement for civil rights and a fight against apartheid in front of us, we will succeed, as we are stronger together.
Among the players who will be present at the annual event in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée. The event will lead Deborra-Lee Furness in Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy – the US Ministry of Internal Affairs for the "blockage" of Russian energy exports.
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke would say after reporting the Washington Examiner magazine that Washington could use the Navy to prevent the Russian energy market, among other things in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (to be warned that the government should be invited) is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire for energy market, as they are marketed in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he should say.
However, the officials believe that there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can fight this. The Navy ensures that our maritime routes are open and, where necessary, block them, thus preventing Russian energy from reaching the market," he said.
The markets were addressed to the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumer Union, a non-profit group, which is known as the US 'the voice of energy consumers'.
He pointed to Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, in which he pointed out that it was actually the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic potential is more or less likely to affect fuel and their replacement," he said, marking Russia as a "ponies known as a trik", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at the time the Trump administration attempted to increase its exports of depleted natural gas to Europe, where Russia, which is the most valuable choice for European consumers, was to be made.
In this regard, officials of the Trompo government, including U.S. President Donald Trumpom, are trying to convince Germany that it would be allocated to the "unimpressed" gas project North Stream 2, which would be behind the Berlin "talek" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 is worth 11 billion USD, which would double existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, except an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is the case for unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same position that energy should not be a tool for implementing pressure and that consumers must have the right to select suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a September meeting with American Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Integrating a third country to our energy supply is a big problem for me," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "studyly examine" her candidate for the US President's 2020 elections, a real Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "studently explore" her candidate for the American president after the interlocution.
In the city house in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren has confirmed that she's going to think about the candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, which requires women's leadership," said the newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine my candidate for the President directly."
Warrenova played the role of President Donald Trumpa at a meeting in the city's house, because "this country would lead in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing for our democracy, I'm worried about," she said.
Warrenov has already been criticised several times by Trumpa and a candidate for the President of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need the FBI investigation before the elections."
The survey published on Thursday showed that most of her own voters believe that Warren 2020 should not be held as president.
According to a survey of the University's Political Research Centre in Suffolk/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not apply for a president, which is 17% of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-two percent would support her candidate.
The survey showed that there was greater support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of the investigators to support and 48 per cent to oppose her.
The second high-ranking democracy that would take account of the candidate for the 2020 elections was former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
After reporting to the Associated Press, the agency said it would be officially decided by January.
Sarah Palin, in support of Donald Trump, mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palina
Track Palin, aged 26, has been in the military for years in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"Because my own son, who lives after his return, is in contact with other families who deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain measure of injury that our soldiers are returning to," said the municipality in agreement with the support of Donald Trumpu in Tulsi, Oklahoma.
The son of Palinova has marked the arrest of his son "slon in the salon" and has made her son and other military veterans return to a number of changes, disbanded, asking where respect for what soldiers and aircraft and all other members of the military have given to the State."
Trakka Palina was arrested on Monday in the location of Wasilla in Aljaski and charged with violence in families with assaults on women, arresting the family and possession of weapons in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a representative of the police station in Wasilli.
18 bound countries and the region of Colombia support the creation of a new asylum policy
Eighty-seven federal countries and the Colombia area support the legal challenge of a new American policy, which, in the face of torture or family violence, violates the right to asylum.
The NBC News Agency reported that representatives from 18 countries and the above-mentioned environment on Friday completed the court's claim to support the legal defence of the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which the American Association for Civil Liberties introduced against the federal policy, was not published.
She said that her partner and his "violent sons, members of the mob," violated her request for asylum on 20 July, but the American authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was taken to Texas.
The federal prosecutors of the Federal Republic of Greece, Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous applications for asylum in the United States have been described as countries that are facing problems with torture and family violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States in 2014 triggered the decision of the Committee on the Appeals of Migrants, which was not bound by an immigrant who fled from domestic violence, to apply for asylum.
The state prosecutor for the province of Colombia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "prevents the decades of national, federal and international law."
‘The binding law requires that all asylum claims be considered on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such prohibition violates the principle,’ the court stated.
The State prosecutors further indicated in the request that the policy that immigrants are entitled to enter is harmful to the American economy, as it would be more likely that they become entrepreneurs and that they would "encourage the necessary labour force".
The General Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has decided that June should no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and torture.
"Azil is available to those who leave their home country because of the persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," the session said on 11 June in its policy release.
Azil was never meant to solve all the problems, even the real problems that people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palau has doubled, but there are busy attempts to find survivors
The situation was worse for the survivors.
"The feeling is very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, when she approached her warm boyfriend at the evacuation center in the town of Palu.
"The rescuers continue to bring the bodies.
It lacks clean water.’
It was found in the ruins, returning to destroyed houses that had been moved through forced goods and tried to find anything useful.
Victims were overloaded in hundreds of people and hospitals that destroyed 7.5 earthquakes.
Some injured, including Dwi Hariz, who suffered the injuries of the back and the shoulder, were cured outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated with persistent severe childhood problems on the ground.
When he mentioned a violent earthquake that hit the hotel room in the fifth floor in which he was raised with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think it hit me against breaking the wall," Harris told the agency Associated Press. He added that he was with his family in the city because of the wedding.
"I heard the woman who called for help, and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses the Chinese 'adlegation' with 'propagand'
A week after the publication of a four-way statement of the official newspaper of China in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China Peking accused the abuse of the US press for spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned the supplement paid by China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register – the best magazine ever sold in the federal state of Iowa, after China accused the intervention in the American Congress on 6 November, as China's lawyer.
The Reuters agency reported that US federal officials accused Trump's claim that Peking tried to intervene in American federal elections described as a new phase in the most intense effort of Washington to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish commercial promotion announcements, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in all the more intensive trade wars in which you are exchanged with the introduction of customs on imported products.
The Chinese refund rates at the beginning of the war should affect exporters in the countries of the Union, such as Iowa, which supports the Republican side of the Republic of Cyprus, were made by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to the Chinese and former long-term Governor Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Peking was a victim of American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the weekly edition of the newspaper Des Moines Register, "now this extension is doubled by advertising propaganda in our own free press".
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has used a valued American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid announcement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path, as the city is severely monitored by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese journals rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not indicate which.
Republicans lose their volitions prior to interlocution with the province of Kavanaugho, warning analysts
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important republics who support and advocate the candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the coming internal conflicts with the loss of vote.
The feelings are extremely high here, and most of the Republicans have already done so that they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of politics at Maxwell University University in Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill magazine.
Reeher said that there's no doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI will be sufficient in the last minute to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national representative of the MovingOn Progress Group on Friday, after the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors shot 'November is coming!', when they demonstrated in the Senate hall when the Republicans, who are in charge of the judicial committee, decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment in spite of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's speech, reported the press portal Mic.
"The inspiration and motivation of democratics will overcome all borders," said the portal journalist Stu Rothenberg, a non-Special political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and keep it.
However, it could be even more powerful, especially among undefined voters in the provinces and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who do not like the President but who do not often like him.’
Even before the Ford's public talk, in which he described in detail his complaints about the sexual attack of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analytical actions were made to enable further Republican support to have a negative impact.
"This has become a big mistake to the GOP," Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Council, told the NBC News Agency at the beginning of last week.
"It is not only for the vote of the world or the final vote or of Kavanaugh's imprisonment; it is also for the way the Republicans accept it and treat Fordov," said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities Group, who supports democratic elections.
But the Americans seem to have a few divisions between them, whether they believe the story of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a few more support from the next.
A new survey of YouGov says that 41 percent of the investigators are sure or most believed in Ford's story, and 35 percent have done so to ensure or best believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of them thought that Kavanaugh was probably lying or probably lying, and only 30 percent said about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake FBA, he is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, and at least one prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
The Ford was a week before the Senate's court council, under oath, telling her that when she was 17 years old, Kavanaugh was attacked in a guilty state.
Ramirez's claim that she was a high court candidate who showed her sex when they were together at the party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The founder of the World Web aims to start a new Internet to match Google and Facebook
The team of Berners-Lee, the owner of the world website, opens up an insurance company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Googlu.
The last project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open-ended Solid platform of Berners.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's purpose was "to rule the world".
"We decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"The game for a historical moment."
The application uses a Solid platform technology that allows users to create a "private database for data storage" or a POD
This may include contact information, performance summary, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's similar to being Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal database for data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access the information.
The company calls it "a personal data recovery".
Executive Director John Bruce says that the intention of the company to combine the resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow access to the Solid platform to everyone.
The companies are currently forming Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the found developers for work on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
With this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group "with Facebook and Google don't talk about whether they could make a complete change that could remove all their business models through the night."
"Don't ask them for permission."
In a press release on the Media portal, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's purpose was to "ensure commercial energy and ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of a new network built on the Solid platform."
In 1994 Berners-Lee reviewed the Internet with the establishment of World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute for Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"In view of the following times of the network, I am extremely optimistic," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The holiday of the Victorian Cross from World War I · Global Voices
In the home city for 100 years they have been celebrating the award of a victorious cross to the sole priest of the Church of England, who received it as a war in the first world war.
Honourable Colonel Bernard Vann earned recognition on September 29, 1918, in an attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a bomber, so he never realized that he had been given the highest honor in the British military.
On Saturday at Rushden, Northamptonshire, two Colonels discovered a monumental stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that the stone was "extremely symbolic", that the stone was discovered about 100 years after the grandfather's act, with which he deserved the redemption.
After a report by journalist London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Quintina "with a very nice and powerful fire of war field and machine."
Later, he planned against the shooting squad and led on with “the largest gang” and then attacked the machine and handed down three members of the team.
Colonel Vanna was shot by a German bomber on October 4, 2018 – just a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of the old father were "something I know and could never reach, so teach me humility."
With his brother, Dr. James Vanna, they're on the parade that led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, also put a venison.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this paradise," and "that the courage of the real hero is reflected in the support that many people will express."
Excited over mixed battle skills were burned all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were part of Puise Pepe.
Imagine: Every night you lighted to watch the Bellator 206 fully sold, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose was attended by 13 people, including six in the main park, who were transferred to the United Kingdom to live on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to remember, observers in the United Kingdom were reluctant to find that the transfer was replaced by the premise of Puys Pepa.
Marcido wasn't even excited, because he stayed up to the morning's right because of the doubt.
One of the enthusiasts on Twitter described a child’s risk as "some kind of pain."
"In accordance with the government regulation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Bellator organisation for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Poussa Pepa."
The president of the Bellator organization, Scott Cooker, said they were trying to adjust the clock so that they would also be included in the future in the United Kingdom.
"When I think about reproducibility, I think we can fix it," said Coker.
"But then there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to do this until Sunday after our time or Monday after them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me that a number of messages have been changed during the transition and that not all of them have been accepted.
We tried to settle the matter; we thought it was only a technical mistake.
However, there was a real reason for the government regulation.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
Instead of six, we will carry five battles — as usual, and we have tried to offer more than we could expect, and we have seen ourselves doing so.
It is a very thankless situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "valueless" about sex.
Olympian co-rapporteur Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to everyone – but this gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that it was "not everyone" as I did when he entered high school.
In his first speech in the Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4 radio station, he said he talked about the rights of gays to give another "trust".
He also said that when he became an elder, his desire to win the Olympics was diminished.
The regular director of a long-term divorce, Kirsty Young, was absent because of a multiple-month illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outlaw in Laverne's first surrender, said that he felt less valuable than everyone else, since "he wasn't socially acceptable to have boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, these feelings of worthlessness and diversity are a real thing that gives me the strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” and said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his orientation.
Twice the Olympic champion became an influential LGBT lawyer, and twice a year he appeared at the Games of the League of Nations in Australia to call on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was speaking because he felt happy that he could talk openly without consequences and that he wanted to give others a "hope".
Three times the world's first said he was a novelist with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "prevented."
Daley was married to a 20-year-old slave, but he says that the difference in years has never been a problem.
'When you're so young' – at the age of 14, he took part in the first Olympic games, and three years later his father died – he said it's hard to find someone of the same age who would experience a similar setback and fall.
A couple of June adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says he changed his "all-view" with this.
"If you'd asked me about the launch year, everything you'd have to say is, "I have to get gold medallion," he said.
"But, you know, in the world there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of cancer on the brain.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had an entry for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first place.
I couldn't say to him, "You're just not going to be the first kind, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead, I had to finally admit that he was not harmless," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympic Games in 2012 and achieved a bronze medal.
"I knew it was the one I had dreamed of all my life – to compete in Olympic games in front of the household. There was no better feeling," he said.
It was also inspired by his first choice of songs – the Proud songmaker Heather Small, who followed him in preparation for the Olympic Games and who still wears his skin.
The delivery of Desert Island Discs is scheduled for BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson's Saturday Ryder's meeting took place.
The American Phil Mickelson will be playing his 47th game in Ryder's gift, setting a record, but he will have to go back in shape so that he won't be a lucky dancer.
Mr. Mickelson, who is already working on the 12-year-old record, let Captain Furyk sit on Saturdays.
Instead of being in the middle of the event, as was so often for the United States, a five-time winner survived a day as a runner and a part in improving his game in order to fix his weight.
Given that neither on the top of the career nor measured the best course, 48-year-olds do not match the most difficult game of Le Golf National, where the long horse inevitably punishs the wrong hits.
And if only the game wouldn't be scary enough, Mickelson will have a deal with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari, who was in the rush to win in all four games this week with the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who have at the beginning of 12 individual games less than four games, were to begin well, Michaelson's game could prove to be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, and he didn't say enough.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he chased me through my back and killed me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"There's a lot of confidence in you.
He was one of the famous and in the past, and he also brought the team a great deal this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought you were more than that, but that's how it went out, and we thought it should be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Falda on Sunday for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could indicate the conclusion of Ryder's career, which never really agreed with the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 swords, 20 shots and seven surprises, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"It's fun, it's sarcastic, it's a ghost, it's a work of man-made spiders and it's beautiful to have in the team space," he explained.
"I think young players were having fun when they moved with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be achieved
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, from experience, knows that a significant advantage can be achieved at the beginning of the last day of the game of individuals in Ryder's neck easily turns into an unpleasant ride.
In 1997, young Danec debited at the Valderrami game, where the captain, Seve Ballesteros, had five advantage points before the Americans, and the goal was to move only with the preference for the forest, with the result of 141⁄2-131/2.
"Don't forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrami; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but the coma," said Bjorn (in the picture) in view of the team Class of 2018 , who won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and told Le Golf National to tell from 10-6.
That's why the story tells me, and everyone in the team says she's not finished yet.
You play full tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need.
It's not over until it's written on the table.
We have a goal to win this prize, and we must remain focused on it.
I've always said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world."
Excited over the game of his players at the demanding game, Bjorn added: “You would never be overrun here.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Tomorrow will be in front of the individual game, so it will take a different flight.
It's nice to have partners when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfers are finally tested.
This is a message that you must pass on to the player: Tomorrow you must get the best out of yourself.
Now let your partner go for you, and he must draw out of you the best."
In contrast with Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordana Spietha and Justin Thomas, who reached three points from four.
Furyk was already on both sides of the translation in the last day, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out the "Court in Medina".
"I remember every word you translate," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, told his players on the final day of the game.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important courses, but we would like to start working as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this effort gets sustained, it's strong pressure on the middle of the game.
We've created an appropriate establishment and put the boys in a way, until we felt we'd do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was commissioned to try to lead the fight and match Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the second Europeans in the upper half of the class.
"In this group of boys, I have decided for this kind of order, because I think it covers all the schedule," Bjorn said about the selection of individuals.
The new German military ship has been relocated
The latest freshest German Navy would have to be handed over in 2014 to replace the old warships from cold war, but local municipalities will not be reported due to the distortion of systems and rapid growth costs by the next year.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship, led by the new class frigate Baden-Wuertmberg, is now transferred to the first half of 2019, the real journalist Die Zeit, who is appointed by the military representative.
The vessel should join the 2014 Navy, but the ambitious project will raise concerns after delivery.
The four classes of Baden-Wuertmenberg, commissioned in 2007, will be replaced by the ageing class of the Bremen class.
It is expected that they will have a powerful top, a kind of anti-teleletal and anti-attack explosives and some hideous technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include further maintenance – the latest frigates to remain outside the home port for up to two years.
And the continued delay means that the top military ships, which should enable Germany to exert its influence over the sea by the time the application began to grow older, says journalist Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
That was the first time it happened that the mariner came back to the shipyard after supply.
The reasons for the return are known only for a small number of reasons, and the German municipalities have identified a number of key "programmable and technical deficiencies" which would make the warship useless if they continued on the war mission.
The shortcomings of the software equipment were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuertertenberg class would manage the crew with about 120 marines – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is a heavy burden, reducing its capacity and limiting the chances of marines for its future recovery.
7000-tonnes of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship should be twice more difficult than ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the second world war.
In addition to the missing equipment, the whole project's price has also become a problem – including the training of crews.
This would reach EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) from the start of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates remain particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the mariners are actually "lowing ships suitable for attack."
The officer said that the issue was temporarily interrupted because the old ships had been wrecked, and the replacement vessels were not secured.
He regretted that the sailors can't join any ship from the Baden-Wuertmberg class.
The National Fund belongs to the secret life of non-terrorists
At the presence in Scotland, new research is being carried out that seeks to find out how non-tempirical people use food for food.
They hope that the results will reflect the conduct of these unique flight crews and help to focus on future conservation activities.
In the study, the scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small neutropires and small neutropires, and the rivets will capture neutropires and guide neutropires at the Inverwe Gardens estate in the Western Ross area.
In key locations, special photographers will be set up to monitor the activities of non-terrorists throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all the findings will confirm the frequency of calls for non-to-peer and what kind of action they take.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their management throughout the country.
Rob Dewar, NTSC consultant for nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most suitable for non-stop and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of grasslands and the preservation of forests for non-to-peat and other species.
The number of non-stop populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined dramatically in the last century.
It threatens the construction and development work that affects the shelter and loss of habitat.
Risks also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as mussels and certain types of chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Netopiers aren't really blind.
Because of the night's instruction, you're better able to help with your money than with your eyes.
For exact determination of error and error on the route, the pre-defined techniques of elongation shall be used.
NTS, responsible for supplying more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land per country, does not take very seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspection of the shelter and temporary solutions.
The organization has set up the first and only Scottish reserve, especially for non-profit purposes, at the presence of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for him.
"We have a great area for non-stop," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all quality habitats.
However, it is still very well known about non-smokers, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to accomplish."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of non-smokers prior to the execution of maintenance parts on the holdings, since possibly the destruction of one family member of non-smokers could cause death to 400 Sami and young people, which could mean the loss of the entire local population.
They are not protected, so they are forbidden to kill, rape or rape, and they are also forbidden to destroy their family.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Non-Discrimination Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about our people and we just don't know how to keep their people well."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence, and lawyers are preparing for a German magazine complaint
Cristian Ronaldo was accused of violence to be wrong, labeled him a "false news" and said that people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing a German magazine complaint with Der Spiegel's reporters who filed a complaint.
The attackers from Portugal and Juventus claimed that in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas, the US, named after Kathryn Mayorga.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay $375,000 for the event milk.
In the statement of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video more hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, reported for "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have done is false news," said the fifth-time Goldenjoge winner in the chamber.
“With the use of my name they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want everyone well," the smiling player added.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing for the Der Spiegel trial, which they referred to as "an unacceptable report of suspicions about private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for "unimposed damage to the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The daily incident should take place in June 2009 at the hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation submitted at the district court around Clark in Nevada, she should return to the playing room at the Mayor Club with Ronald after meeting, and this should strengthen her there anally.
Maiorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and said that he was a "99% good man" who was disappointed in only "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a sexual relationship, but he described it as an agreement.
Mayorg also claims that she went to the police and that she was photographed by her injuries in the hospital and later agreed to an external remedy because she was "seriously afraid of torture" and was concerned with "public humiliation".
34-year-olds say he wants to get a fair divorce, because he's still having a serious trauma due to the sudden event.
Ronaldo was just in the middle of a sudden attack from Real Madrid in Manchester, Manchester, U.S.A., and this summer, he moved to the Italian capital Juventus, worth 100 million dollars.
Brexit: United Kingdom 'will always regret' loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘will always regret’, if after the brake it would lose the status of the world’s leading car manufacturer, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "occurred" that Toyota UK for BBC said that the Great Britain exit from the EU without agreement would temporarily stop production in a warehouse in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the border could lead to the loss of jobs without agreement in the event of a broken down.
Tovarna Burnaston, which manufactures Toyotin Auris and Avenues model, produced almost 150,000 cars from which 90 % of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in the event that Britain would withdraw from the European Union by the end of March without agreement, production in our warehouse would stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Concern about how the EU's non-contractual exit will affect cross-border trade has also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW company, for example, has made it possible for Brexit to close its factory Mini in Oxford in a month.
The main ideas relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brakes.
Toyotin’s production line runs according to the principle ‘in the right time’, where supplies from the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles arrive at every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom emerged on 29 March without agreement from the EU, this could lead to disturbance at the borders for which Panamanian representatives say it could cause unemployment and unemployment.
Toyota in his store in Derbyshire would not be able to co-ordinate for more than one day, the company's representatives were involved, so the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that therese May's plan for future EU relations was "smartly dead to destroy such border verification".
"We have to reach agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will enable us, as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but to seize this opportunity," he said today's BBC-Radio 4.
"Data not only toyote, but also other producers are that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful collection of supply faiths."
Toyota’s company could not comment on how long the production would have been stopped, and for a long time it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in the Burnaston store for 24 years and is the founder of the U.S. union in the store, said that his members are more concerned: "After my experiences, the job will never come back."
The government representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The trumpeting with Rosenstein could be resumed, the real White House
An important meeting of Donald Trumpa with the deputy general prosecutor, Rodod Rosenstein, could be "presented for another week" by the White House on Sunday because of the ongoing colour of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugha.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian voluntary intervention, links between the Trumps and Russia and the potential presidential ban on the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will abandon the agent of the Attorney-General and thus jeopardise Mueller's independence has been under attack for several months.
At the beginning of the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of the hearing equipment for recording talks with Trump and the possibility of withdrawing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein left the report.
The last Monday, he visited the White House, the middle of the report about his intention to leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would “not forgive” and then stopped the meeting in order to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate court hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Fordov.
On Friday, Trump identified a single-unit investigation of the complaint against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote of the Senate.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: ‘The date has not yet been determined, so that it could happen this week, depending on all the rest of the case at the Supreme Court, and we could leave it for another week.
We'll see. I always want to make sure you're informed."
Some reporters would agree with this, and Sanders hasn't been calling the White House from the press since September 10.
The leader in charge of Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the number of meetings would not be opposed to "setting" TV reporters, but he said, "You couldn't deny that they are setting up."
Then she mentioned that the direct relationship between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president held more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding, "We have looked at the numbers without mentioning the source."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn their questions directly to the President of the United States, it will always be better than discussing with me.
We are trying to make this possible and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference that you can talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
A self-sustained press conference is rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why he showed himself to the armed journalists in a modest and somewhat unusual way.
Letter from the Minister for Health of EU workers in NHS Scotland concerning the horror related to Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote to the EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express appreciation for the country and want to continue the work even after the unemployment.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's release from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the cost of setting up the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued during the summer of the year, as we approach the decision-making process.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also speeded up preparations for a possible stage without agreement.
I know it has to be a matter of great concern to you all the time.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel fully at home. We really want to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
Tennesse State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, who was injured by a head injury at 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, stopped the emergency operation, reported Mike Organ from The Tennesean magazine.
The chief coach of Tennessee State University told the journalist that the damage happened just a little before midnight.
"He went to the game shop and somehow broke up there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen before they put it on the table and carried it from the game to further review.
Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, said that Abercrombie is responsible for surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the details of the type/wide injury are not yet known" and that the University of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, who is currently at the university, plays for the Tennesian State University first after moving from University to Illinois.
On Saturday he experienced five hits before he left the game, which his total number of hits in the season pushed to 18 hits.
Other buyers will charge higher rates in the United Kingdom when buying real estate
Other buyers will charge higher rates in the United Kingdom for purchase of non-premises and additional money will be used to assist the homeless in the new schemes.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
Increase in the amount will be calculated by those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The warehouse expects her to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, and she'll hire them to help the homeless.
A foreign buyer will calculate a higher rate of cash in the United Kingdom when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and the collected money will be spent on a loan, and theresa May will be reported today.
The stress should be understood as an attempt to neutralise Jeremiah Corbin's efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure a more affordable position and greater taxation of high-income people.
The increase in the amount will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will encourage government efforts to eliminate unemployment.
The benefit, calculated in addition to the current quota, including the higher levels indicated two years ago for other homes and non-premises for delivery, could not be less than three per cent.
It is expected that the measure will collect up to EUR 120 million per year from the introduction of the measure.
According to the estimates, the unsustainable United Kingdom should buy 13 per cent of the newly-equipped London estates, resulting in two prices and more difficult purchases of the first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirits” because the number of buyers who spend most of their time abroad is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the number so that young people could buy their first home.
A large construction company accused the price increases with the acquisition of a country that was not actually used, Mr. Mayev called for the release of quotas for price-free housing in order to correct the British "situated shame."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the supervision of rent and the completion of forced settlements without error.
In addition, the city council wants to give more privileges to build new houses.
Mr. Mayeva said: “In the past year, I have done so that I will renew my primary leadership of British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
It also means the correction of our non-performing housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be true that it is just as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as for garage British citizens.
For too many people, dreams about their own home are too far away, and humiliation is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to run a Scotland Club"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" has ever become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Schkot enjoys the challenge of the restoration of the North-East Club, currently seating the third city in the First League, with three points less than the first one.
He moved to the stadium of light this summer after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish Presidency in the last season.
"For my country I wanted to play as a player.
I took B capico and it was, "Ross told us about the BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up with the usual observation of Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that brought me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I had succeeded in running the club.’
Ross' predecessors at the head of the Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of the Alla Athletic Museum, who had previously rejected the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Towna, says that as a successor of such great names, he was not afraid.
“I succeed in measuring the question ‘Can this club be reinvigorated in the First League?’.”
In view of the structure and capacity of this club, it is undoubtedly falling into the First League," he said.
"The way to it is not easy, but it would probably be for success only if the club could take it there again."
Ross is doing the manager's work for only three years, after being a assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months part of the training staff of Hearrs.
Alloy then helped to prevent the exit in the third league, and St. Mirren brought from the mine the title of the first priority in the next season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than ever when playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real break," Alloe recalled.
“I was absolutely convinced that management is the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny to hear it because it's been like a good player, so I've lived a good life, and I've also achieved some more success.
But the game can become demanding.
We have to deal with a number of things every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management just feels like the right thing to do again.
I always wanted to run a club, and now I do it. In my skin, I feel more comfortable in my whole life now."

The summer’s heat increased the income of the British rainforests, but it also increased the pressure on religious restaurants.
In July, the group of pubs and barons increased by 2.7%, but the income of the restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who prepared the data, said: “Entirely solar time and participation in England’s global charity, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar example as June last month, when the incidence of pumps increased by 2.8 percent, only that the restaurants were more affected.
The traffic decline in restaurants increased by 1.8 per cent in June.
Traffic in pipes and bars with drinks has increased in comparisons more than the traffic in restaurants has decreased.
As a result of the sun time, sales also decreased in pipes that offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go to a drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sale of a drink increased by 6.6 per cent in one month, and the sale of food decreased by three per cent.’
Paul Newman from a group of free time and love analysts said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The biggest time factor and the impact of major social or sports events remain on the guest market.
It is not surprising that the Group of Restaurants continues to fight, although the fall of 4.8 per cent at the mid-year level will still be particularly painful because of some of the costs.
For locals with long-term meals, it would not be possible to arrive at more wrong time and only time will tell whether it will be necessary to restore the temperature we have experienced in August.’
The joint sale in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % on July, indicating the temporary introduction of trade marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, sales benchmark in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the success of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is established by an industrial rapporteur.
One of the five children has a secret account on the social network that hides it from parents
Research has shown that there is one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, on the social network a secret account hidden before parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 diakis showed the growth of false Instagram pages
The paper strengthened the fears of the disclosure of sexual content
Twenty percent of the diaries have been able to have a "main" account for parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, is making an account on social networks that is hidden before parents.
A survey of 20,000 diaries showed rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The paper strengthened the fears of advertising with the related content.
Twenty percent of the diaries have been able to manage the censored "main" accounts that parents tell them, and they also have private accounts.
Mother, who was on the secret side of a 13-year-old girl, noticed that the daughter of a visitor called to strengthen her.
A survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of Independent Schools (HMC) Networks showed that there are 40 per cent of 11-18-year-olds, and half of them recognize that they have a private account.
President HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many people are subject to temptation and you create a web space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will “vote’s voice” on the Scottish athletic board
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic committee as an imperfect director of the annual general assembly of the Management Committee.
Doyle was the most famous Scottish athletes in the field and in the free and president Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community. We are confident that the athletics in Scotland, with its involvement in the committee, will greatly benefit," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be able to act as a voice for the athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help in driving sports in Scotland."
The American , who won from the total of four Olympic medals over 200 metres and 400 metres in the Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for BBC, remained without the ability to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I was arrested.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors have said that he will only tell me the time I can repeat and in what way I can repeat it.
The work was hard, but I did everything I could, I learned to walk again, and today I'm running yours for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
The press release, which compares mothers to cows, has divided the online opinion
The company producing breast-feeding rats has divided opinions into a declaration that compares mothers to cows in the lungs.
At the beginning of the ‘first silent transmission belt’ marketing, Elvie’s consumer technology company has published a stimulating video message to show the mother all the freedom of aid.
The four real mothers dance in the company of cows in the snow, filled with snow, in a song that includes the following words: "Yes, I am tired, but I can't see any rain," and "If you haven't noticed, it's not my sister, it's my uncles."
The scroll continues, "Shut up, cut out, feed the baby, shut up, shut up, touch the baby."
However, the announcement published on Facebook’s website has caused an excessive divergence on the Internet.
After 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he saw mixed reactions of viewers, many of whom were working on the ‘grosot’ account of the milk industry.
"The use of the obligation to announce this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also suck and suck to produce milk, but children steal to them in the first days after the wedding," one wrote.
Elvie's haircut is discrepancies in the pancreas (Elvie/Mother)
The other commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and young people.
But why not use them to announce breast-feeding for mothers who keep their children?'
Someone else added: "A voice completely without feeling."
The others praised the announcement that one of the women admitted that she seemed to be singing "for church fun".
"It seems to me a great idea.
I'd buy it if I still had it.
I felt just like a cow.
The announcement was a few norm, but I understood it, as it was thought.
It's a generic product," another wrote.
One commented: “This is a funny announcement that aims at mothers who are milking (often at work or abroad) and feel like cows."
This is not a declaration that would praise or condemn the milk industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing with dark-fashioned bells.
The concept of actions is that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
Elvie Pump is completely quiet, without a rope or a rope, and is discrepancies in the breast milk, which enables women to move, hold the child, and even activity on the ground during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD on the subject, commented further. "The Elvies are so revolutionary that you deserve a decent and provocative representation."
As a result of the comparison between women who are breastfeeding, and the cows we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its challenges, and in this way, in a fun way that women can relate to, show an incredible feeling of freedom that will bring the new breast.
That's not the first time Elvie came to the headlines.
During the London Week fashion, the mother of two children at the Maneken step went to make Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants who are quietly moved to the chess court at the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has increased greatly, even though the number of months of the months of transitions remains unchanged, partly because the gross retirement and policies introduced by the Tromp's administration have made it difficult for children to be given sponsorship.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to risk their own residence in the country with a request for children.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities notified that potential sponsors and other family members of the household would have to issue fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Carino Agency, told the Congress that the agency had arrested more than ten people who had been asked to sponsor young people without training.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of arrested persons did not have prior criminal records.
"As many as 80% of the people who are sponsors of the sponsors or members of the sponsors are illegal in the country, and most of them are punished by foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to address children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court one month after they were arrested, and not 60 days after the previous standard, the workers in the prison were told.
Many will show themselves with the videoconferencing call and not personally to speak before the immigration court.
Those who claim that they are not eligible for aid will be expelled soon.
As long as the children are pregnant, it is more likely that they become pregnant or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts by the workers in the shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
The prosecutors said that these concerns were greater in larger institutions, e.g. Tornul, where signs of child restraints because of their size are more likely to remain undetectable.
They added that they can move children to a place of lodging, not to prepare them emotionally or to give them an opportunity to talk to friends, who are surrounded by a grass that many of them encounter.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to be removed immediately
Under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moulal of the Syrian refugees called for them to return to their homes, including in the country for the past eight years.
Moulal, who also carries out the Prime Minister's duties, said that foreign forces on Syrian bases were illegal, under the influence of a war against terrorism, and that they would “be treated in accordance with them as well”.
"Unreasonably and unconditionally they have to get away," the congregation said.
Moulalam said that the "war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 330,000 people died in 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, " Almost finished".
He said that Damascus will continue to "war this sacred battle until we clear the Syrian territory" both of the terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-discharged countries.
With regard to refugees, Moulal said that the conditions were appropriate for them to return, and he owed "some Western countries" to "increasing indiscriminate fears" that refugees were persuaded to remain in a foreign country.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their recovery in a more straightforward manner," he said.
"The political issue changes what should be the only humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have promised Syria that it will not receive renewables until Asad and the opposition reach agreement on the end of the war.
The U.S. diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a Tampone cone in the last important opposition area, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the massive attacks of the Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province where three million people live.
However, Moulalem stressed that he had an agreement "just a year" and expressed his hope that military intervention would be directed against the Jihadists, including the fight from Fronte Nusra, which was linked to Al-Qaido, which would be "resurrected".
Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon call the first meeting of the new committee, which will be composed of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a military constitution for Syria and press the way to the elections.
Moulalem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for cooperation in the Committee, stating that the work of the Committee should be limited to “the review of the members of the present Constitution”, and warned before intervention.
Why Trump's gonna get another mandate
Following this decision, Mr. Trump will win again in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to believe, his presidency has sooner ended with interpletion and scandal.
Which would no doubt be "the most dramatic final presidential ever!"
There's no sign of the weakness of viewers for now.
Since 2014, CNN's visibility during the largest watch has doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC's visibility has nearly doubled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers, more than four years ago after Nielsen had 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on the MSNBC channel has reached the largest number of cable players with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the drama "Designed Survivor", about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a well-known writer of comedy and author of the book "Only funny parts: and some hard truth about driving in the Hollywood Boys Club," offers a different explanation.
Remember driving with a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd love Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' he told me.
There's a fun value in the box.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe case against Wad on whether immigrant families can reunite themselves and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Despite this, the six-hour review of the range of experts discussing the use of the source “from the deep background” for the book “Strah” Bob Woodward, USD 15,000 worth of new dreams ("training, heavy fueled by the blast," said The Washington Post) and the shocking descriptions of Trumpov, khm, anatomism.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria again.
"A part of his start-up, which stimulates the spirit of real giving, is that he offers something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the chief director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment company, and the founder of Pawn Stars about the assembly of Trumpo's show and the daily closing scenarios (twice with N.F.L., thank Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to let go of any episode, because you'll be in custody.
When I talked to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the north coast of Kauai at 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was confused inside when he shot CNN.
There was no way he could withdraw, nor did Brett Kavanaugh meet with the Senate Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was high in the air.
"I remember that we then created all these crazy wastes and people said, 'It's the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign money is available in preparation for the most intimate inter-mission election
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, the flow of money was observed, as two candidates were found in the streets for the same seat because of the reorganization of the convention environment.
This was shortly before the newly split Pittsburgh, the home of democratic representative Conor Lamba, who won his seat on special elections last year in the second round.
Lamb competes with another candidate, the Republican Keithom Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is heavily covered with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-enacted when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old environment was anti-repaired for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the new 17th century, the struggle for financing the campaign between the main foreign financial telesomas, the Congress Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed March special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been seating for more than ten years by the Republican, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the vicinity.
Political commentators point to democracy's poor priority.
In the United States, they were considering sanctions against Salvador for the support of China, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with only a little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners had removed the leadership of the Trump's organization.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to suspend the American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, in addition to "renewal decisions on the withdrawal of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the representative of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered by Salvador, which would have received US$ 140 million after the 2017 evaluation, including aid for combating drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a strong impact on the Central American country with great unemployment and the number of deaths.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development, which would continue to hold a similar meeting during the year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the United States.
By mid-September, however, the highest government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, with which they concluded views on the sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now obliged to negotiate a conference that is now planned for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance of the American government for the meeting, the diplomats have added.
Three American envoys returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in the meantime without new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed on their appointment under the terms of anonymity.
Their speech confirmed an external analysis that was close to the government, and he also discussed it under the terms of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to the judiciary, which is now very strong in public records.
Mr. Mueller should also focus on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was working with Russia in an attack on American elections.
If the convention is to change its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before the authorities and perhaps even before the wedding of his colleagues at the moment when he is ready to reopen his voters.
There are a lot of questions in this regard and I do not want to say that Mr Trumpa's accident is inevitable, nor are his relatives in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the war could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to launch an attack on Hitler if the West invaded him and supported him in Munich.
We didn't succeed, so we missed the chance to avoid the clans that followed.
This kind of transition changes the flow of history and speeds up or closes an inexhaustible process of democracy.
The Americans with several of these alternates agree right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump leaves the deputy of General Prosecutor Roda Rosenstein, a man who has in hand the case of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in prison since he reported that he had proposed a secret video of the president and expressed his inadmissibility to this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of The Times was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested investigation by the FBI Bretta Kawanaugh is not to be exhausted or honest or if it is to be named as a senior judge in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interlocutory elections for the Congress, which will require Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we're going to get down to these tests, we're waiting for a long winter democracy.
But I'm sure we won't be disappointed because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - speaking Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat in my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to wear a swastika hat on the table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before encountering Rapid Vienna
In the fourth quarter, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, making it clear that they will win over Austria by an impressive campaign against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, which will put them in a reliable position to qualify from the Group G of the European League.
The damage of the train was prevented by a related player, Graham Dorrans, from appearing first in the season in front of the camp with 2:2 against Villarreal, but I think that Rangers can use it as a delay for more achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal was a powerful team," said 31-year-old.
“In the game we entered into the assurance that we can achieve something and take the point.
You might be able to play a victory at the end, but it's probably an e-mail result on the general team.
They were probably better in the first half, so we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a hard game because in the final game, we have a good outcome, but I'm with a lot of confidence that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year was extremely difficult, in view of everything that happened, including damages and changes in the club itself, but I now have a good feeling about this end.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season for ourselves and succeed."
A poor Spanish woman because of the fear of funerals
Despite having a clear picture of how to care for her, the investigators talk to their family members about it.
Half of the investigators of the National Insurance Agency's investigation have done so that they are legally talking about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them were able to talk to children about it.
"People want her to care for a family member, but they don't try to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector at the National Insurance Agency.
You can start in the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare to take care of yourself if you don’t talk to her about it in time .
Talk to the consultants and the family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include a financial adviser: Your financial adviser can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your selection of long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative to determine the trust of a valuable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the authorisation of persons for their own finances.
Choose the trust of a valuable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these data into the action plan to be prepared.

Poets and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the officials took action, and the number of victims was to increase further.
In the closed communication links, rescuers from the Donghunga region, north of Paluja, near the epicenter of magnitude 7.5, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key data on Paluja and Donghi on Sulawage:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesia, a region located at the end of the lake’s lake on the west coast of the island of Sullavazi and is expected to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The town celebrated the 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donghea is a landscape that extends more than 300 km (180 km) west of the island of Sulvazzi.
The municipality, the administrative unit under the territory, had a population of 299 000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi region are fishing and farming, especially in the central region of Donghen.
In the country, there is also an important activity of mining, which is mostly carried out in Morovalia, on the opposite side of the Soviet Union.
After reporting to the Indonesian Agency for the Exploitation of Natural Disasters in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggio have repeatedly been affected by tsunamis.
In 1938 he caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghi.
In 1996 he also struck north Donggio and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on an active Tihocean fireplace, so the fires appear there regularly.
In recent years, there have been some increased tensions and nightmares as follows:
2004: More floods on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and caused 226,000 people to die along the Indian coast, more than half of them in Acehu.
2005: The type of violent persecution has been attempted by the West Sumatra late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Postres magnitude 6,8 hit the southern part of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, and broke down with the tsunamis that flooded her southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: The magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra region.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Potres magnitude 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai and blew up the peaks up to 10 metres that destroyed your duds and caused about 300 people to die.
2016: Pidie Jaya's reign in Acehu was a tragedy and caused death and panic when people remembered the 2004 death and tsunami.
This time, he did not jump to his knees, but the collapse of the building caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: More attacks have affected the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Potres destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
Arrest of the oldest son of Sarah Palin for violence in the family
Track Palina, the oldest son of Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the violence in the family, the ban on the notification of violence in the family and the arrest of the police agency Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin knew that when he tried to call the police to report the alleged criminal activity, he took the phone.
The palace was closed in the Mat-Su Pre-Case Station and is in custody under an unsecured guarantee of USD 500, the television network KTUU reported.
He appeared at the court on Saturday, where he said he was 'surely innocent' when he was asked about the complaint, the network reported.
The fuel was charged with three category A infringements, which meant that it could be closed up for one year and punished with a deep amount of $250,000.
It was also charged with a cross-sectional category B, which is punished on the same day in prison and deep in the amount of $2000.
The fire of the criminal action is not charged first.
In December 2017 he was accused of an attack on his father, Todd Palina.
Mom, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a mental attack.
The example is currently before the Aljas veterinary court.
In January 2016 he was accused of violence in the family, involvement in the notification of violence in the family, and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
The Palin's girl said he hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by the Veterinary Group when his son’s violent conduct linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning to military service in Iraq.
Funerals in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake, which struck the Indonesian island of Sulawez on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake blew the tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks have been interrupted, and the number of deaths should increase in the coming days.

On social media, video clips show the moment of the attack.
When he hit the coast with tsunamis, more than a hundred people were held in the city of Palu at the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York require a death sentence for Sajfula Saipov, a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been committed for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, to use a delivery truck for the execution of the attack on the coast along the West Side highway in South Manhattan, when he drove several passengers and passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's “natural” killed eight victims and caused serious physical harm, recorded in the report on the request for the death penalty in the South of New York.
According to the court document, the cause of the death penalty may be any of the charges.
More than a week after the attack, Saipov's large-scale jury reported with a complaint in 22 points, which included eight murder charges, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for a "known design and appeal", the prosecutors who described Saip's ways as "study, cruel and vengeful".
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchia, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pannuccoa," wrote a notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the South Environment has condemned the last death penalty ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnesa was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In New York City, the death penalty was last pronounced in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who died as a result of the deaths of the Soviet Union between the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenberg died at the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, citizens of Uzbekistan, during the days and months following the attack, did not show any regret after the court documents had been made.
According to police reports, he told the investigator to feel good about what he did.
According to the complaint, Saip told the authorities that they were inspired by ISIS video crews who were watching them on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said he asked for an ISIS ban to be released in his hospital room.
In view of the 22nd point of the complaint, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were 'expected' by the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the patience of the event," Patton said.
The Saip's defence team asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
In order to negotiate with Brexit, Nigela Faragea, a true Turkish ambassador should be obliged to delay negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage, protest at the Toric conference, promised to "improve the human army".
The former leader of Ukipa said that European politicians must feel the heat when one of his own envoys Therese May suggested that he should be held accountable for negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Ambassador Peter Bonne, on the occasion of Birmingham, said that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if he would be a secretary for Mr Farage's bronchitis.
However, the challenge that confronts him. Mayeva, in coordinating his deep-distributed species, still highlighted the obstacles of the brexitis, which joined the separate protest against brexitis in the city.
The priority is to keep its plan in place between the attacks of Brexit prisoners, the opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva, in Brussels, would try to reach agreement despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and laburs to choose between their packages and "casosom".
Mr. Bonne is at the Leave Means Leave (the exit) in Solihul that "he wants to destroy the Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage for the rapporteur and assign him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been held responsible, he would still be outside."
The messenger from Wellingborough added: "I'm going to break up, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
His opposition to the EU was described in the following words: "We have not fought in the world wars to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bonne rejected the proposal that the public opinion since the 2016 vote had changed: "The idea that the British thought and wanted to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
The agreement was also made by Turkish Brigade Andrea Jenkyns, who said to the rapporteur: “I just say: ‘Minister President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan for the general public is not welcomed, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unwelcome with our parties and our activists, who are active in the streets and even lead us to the election.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.’
In the message, directed by G. Mayev, he added: "The prime ministers shall keep their service when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage agreed that it was necessary to give politicians a "feeling of anger" if they were to issue a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – humanity – and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to send out a piece of bread, and today we gather together to say to them, 'We will not let you do this.'
In the message, the excited majority added: "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class, which is on the job of handing brexite."
"We mobilize the human army of this country, which has given us victory over the brexity, and we will not be at peace until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
While the repairers walked through Birmingham, where they then had a court meeting in the city center.
After establishing a group of activists this weekend, the Torics' arrests against the brexitis were set up.
The Laburist tribe of Lord Adonis laughed at the conservative because of security problems in applying the application of the party after the opening conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all technology for Canada's agreement plus, for the border without restraint, for easy trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a perfect step.
There is nothing like a good brexite," he added.
Warrennova will be able to negotiate the position of President "studyly studied"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "cooperation in the presidential city will be thoroughly studied" after November's elections.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warrennova, who is often critical to President Donald Trumpa, will be re-elected to the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trumpo's volunteer campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It's in the center of speculation to meet Trump in 2020.
The event in Hollywood on Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of "town hall", since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to negotiate for the president's place.
Warrenov replied that it is time for "the village of women in Washington to fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman on top."
Arrest after the death of the LSU Sims player in shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that on Friday the suspect was arrested for shooting the LSU Wayda Sims basketball player.
The police station in Baton Rouge reported on the 20-year-old Simpson arrest at the press conference at 11 a.m. after sunrise.
They published a video of the fifth shooting and asked for help in identifying people on the screen.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed on Friday at the South University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and died of it at last," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, reporting 247sports network.
Wayde figured out to protect a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the end of the incident that he had a weapon and that he shot Wayda Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without arrest and taken to police station East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter teenager who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games from 10 in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps in the game.
Russia's big prize: Lewis Hamilton drew close to the title of the World Cup, and his team ordered him to defeat Sebastian Vettlu
On Saturday, when Valtteri Boltas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "Mercedes will have a powerful impact on the shore".
Bottas started well at the store and almost left Hamilton on the roof when he defended his position in the first two arrests and invited Vettla to attack his own master colleague.
The winner took the first one into the box and let Hamilton drive on the traffic deck, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him into the box later and left him for Vettlo, but Hamilton, after some driving operations, noted that Ferrari's unaccompaniedness leaves the inside of the door open and risk that after two attempts to protect him in the third wheel.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and was at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in the seventh place.
After that, most of the car races without changing the tires, as he intended to take out the fast finish, skip Kimia Raikconen and set up the fourth place.
In the box he ended up in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was unable to increase speed, so he sat in the fourth town of Raikkonen.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was a fantastic car all weekend and was a real horse when he left me out.
The team did a really great job to get first and second," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body talk.
President Donald Trump spoke on Saturday to Senator Diane Feinstein because of her persistence that she did not reveal Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
According to West Virginia, the President did not directly affect Ford's talks before the Senate's investigation commission, but rather, he said that what is happening in the Senate is that people are "bad, corrupt and lying".
"The only good thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see the anger when you can see that people are cruel, corrupt and lying," he said.
"When you look at the advertising and the disclosures, people say, 'No, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you opened the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not reveal it."
Okay, wait a minute.
We discovered it... no, we didn't," he added about the senator's accent.
The Forum sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was discovered in early September – but Feinstein's client came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's complaint, I did not reveal her letter," said the Commission after the report by the journalist The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for confidence, and I kept him confident, as she asked."
However, her disappointment was evidently not the case with the president who agreed on Saturday night: “I tell you, this was a really bad speech of the body.
It may not be true, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
In the defence of a candidate for a Supreme Court accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the President intended that democratics abuse the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen violence, cruelty, no matter who they are trying and who must drive to overcome power and control," the President said after the report of the Mediaite website.
Elitena link: Dundee Stars v. Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two bullets for the Great against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were bought for the fifth loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants with winning on the Saturday game in Dundee with 5:3.
Ginants were told about two hills on the grounds of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were chosen for the home page, and then Dwyer again came to the advantage of Giants.
Francois Bouchard went out for Dundee before they won two grand Lundvald Nielsens.
This was the third episode of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who was defeated on the west of Dundee by 2:1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the monastic season, during which Giantsi was defeated in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal in the game came in four minutes from 3:35 with Kendall McFaulla, Beauviller's assistant, who spent four minutes later, and David Rutherford gave.
In an intensive initial work, Sullivan at 13:10 again placed in the game at home, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowni a surprise at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of Giant's leadership in the rest of the day, when at the end of the first quarter he had his second round of dinner.
The home page was reassessed, and Bouchard's remains came up with a violent cloud at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped to bring Nielsen to Dundee's advantage at the end of the second triangular and provided for the victory with the fifth round of his sword in the last half.
Gianti, who now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game at Milton Keynes Friday.
The air traffic controller, with his death, allowed more than a hundred people on the plane to flee before the attack
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as heroes, after sacrificing their lives to fly with more than a hundred people safely.
In the fifth earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by the tsunami, more than 800 people died, and many were missing.
The areas continue to stress the strong tropical sun, and many people are caught in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the employees escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a powerfully swirling control chair at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed in it so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the airway, could safely fly off.
Then he jumped out of the control chair because he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved more than a hundred lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to Kalinantana to a large hospital in another town.
We're sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart is on the market when we hear it," he added.
While the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach more than a thousand, the accident relief agency in the country has been limited to access to the city in Donghi, Sigiya and Bouangang.
"The number of the dead should increase further, as the number of bodies were destroyed, and many of us could not reach," said the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
The floor, where many funerals will take place on Sunday, was abandoned with waves, up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the rescue vehicle carries the body.
He's missing clean water.
The minimum marks have been dropped everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help me survive, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy that can become even worse."
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu and told the national army: “I beg you all to work night and day to fulfill all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" after reporting CNN.
In Indonesia, at the beginning of this year, more than 550 people died.
Micronesian Air Navigation Company Air Niugini now claims that after air traffic controllers fail one person
The airline that operated the flight that flew into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia is now saying that one person is missing, after first reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the passenger plane.
Air Niugini's company announced on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
In the airline, it was reported that the search for the wrong was accompanied by local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The invitation for more information on the passenger, such as his age or his nationality, was not immediately answered.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews, after the plane crashed along the water when it was trying to reach the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said they took seven people to the hospital on Friday.
At the airport, it was reported that there were eight passengers in the hospital on Saturday who were all in a stable condition.
The reason for the suspension and the exact order of the events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have been informed that the plane has arrived in the valley just before the stage.
Some stories made it clear that the plane was wrong.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was going down very low.
"That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers had managed to cross the passage through a stream of drinking water to violent exits on a floating plane.
He said the guards were in a panic and drunk, and I suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy also announced that seafarers who had repaired wells in the vicinity had been helped by the use of a steaming coal that people had carried to the ground before the plane crashed about 30 metres (100 feet) deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last two decades in the airport accidents in Papua New Guinea, 111 people died, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
Analyticals determined the time of the night when a woman's life was claimed
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in the retrial of a man who was charged with the claim that a woman from Mississippi was alive in 2014.
An analysis by the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett has been talking for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described how he used the phone tape to determine the movement of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was received from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were at the time of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with a friend of Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him, but Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford warehouse that night, he said he was "false, because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second misunderstanding was that Tellis said that Chambers knew about two weeks when she died.
The phone records say you've met only one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, in time after Chambers' death, deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence should present final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury would judge the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What's the Western hippo?
The hipop trio wants to challenge the negative kind of general by filling up its voices with positive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that the hipop has departed from the original political and social commitment.
They want to go back to their roots and make a contemporaneous favorite again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence of artists like Akal and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another nigger?!
The New York Barrier accused a couple of leaving her because of a "racist" message
The New York Guard accused a couple of being discriminated against after receiving the wrong message from a mother claiming to be "one black."
A couple of delays in the growth process and a complaint are compared to "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when a new guardsman, Giselle Maurice, found that he was a black man.
"NEEEEEEEEE another ČRNKA," she wrote in her letter to her husband, the Plastic-Flaxmanov.
But instead of sending him a man, she sent him twice to the G. Maurice.
Following the discovery of her pregnancy, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "favorable", left Mr. Maurice, saying that she had done a poor job with her ex-wife, who was an African American, wanted to hire the Philippines, reported a New York Post journalist.
Mr. Maurice received a pay for one day's work, and then they sent her home with Uber.
Maurice's money is now at the court's request for compensation and at a rate of $350 per day for six months for the work to be done for which she was first hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, you know, these things aren't going to happen," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the racial complaint that the release of Maurice was reasonable, since they feared that after their complaint they would no longer be able to trust her.
"The woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
Not a racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband to Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone to whom you were innocent, even if it happened with aid?
Your newborn?
Come on.'
In comparison with the "extremination" complaint, Plasco said his wife was born two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
“Are you going to get over someone like this?
This is not good," the investment banker added.
Although the court proceedings are still pending, the Court of Public Opinion has ruled quickly on social networks because of its conduct and way of thinking.
The stories about the Paddington bear have been told not to connect to the speaking bear, a new letter has been published
Karen Jankel’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of her letter: “It was hard to put into the skin of someone who had first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to do this now when Paddington has become an outstanding achievement."
She was saying that her father, who first worked as a cameraman for BBC, before getting the inspiration to write a book about a small bear game, would be angry when she refused her work, added that after her death she was a 60th anniversary of the book "Grenko-Slave".
With regard to the widow Paddington, who described her as a "very important member of our family", she said that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a man who didn't like to praise himself," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if he had achieved something to your child: You are proud of him, although you don’t really do it yourself.
I think that Uncle Paddington was looking at something like that.
Although it came to his mind and his opinion, success has always represented the bear Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to make a phone call from her.
Her daughters moved to Louis Pasteur's Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to preserve her life.
"It was a regular call to tell you that it was really bad to feel that she didn't expect it to happen," he said.
"Then I got Nad's call. He told me she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to swear to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, that's how I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart steady were slowly taken and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit and wait, you know, it's all going to work out.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position when my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to hold on."
Ednan Laperous, who has already complained about the loss of his daughter, jumped into the plane together with other passengers, unaware of the experience that stops her.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head cut off, and all the time they were on my face in the shower.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling toward Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Laughing women's leopards crying to prevent automorrows on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide attempt to deny life to others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys at the Valzian Bridge, you are crying with inspiring messages and phone numbers on which people can turn to support.
Mr. Tyler was 13 when he fell into depression and died at the age of 18.
"For no parent I don't want to feel as I do every day," she said.
Mr. Davis, a 45-year-old living in Lydney, said her son was a busy cook with a funny smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always made his smile shine on every room."
However, before his death he ceased to work because he was “a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took that life.
Mr. Davis said, "I don't care if there's a domino effect coming up."
Mr. Davis made a complaint, "to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's for friends.
Do not sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mr. Humphreys, who had been Davies' friend for years, died shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say to feel tired, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Sunday he was completely asleep. When the children opened the gifts, he didn't make an eye contact with them or anything like it."
She said that her death was a terrible tragedy, but they had to convince her: “She has been torn in pieces in the family.
She betrayed us.
But we must continue to fight and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh all at the beginning of the FBI air investigation
"I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – after the duration and scope of a limited investigation, it might be a point for us," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would be "reliefed" because of the strong side of the country.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is the result of the time in which the investigation would take place.
Up to the interlocutory elections that will take place on 6 November is only five weeks – if the Republicans, as expected, do not do so, it will be very difficult for them to choose a willing person at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senator several times to provide support to Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who was presenting him to his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will take place at the Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could have gathered at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would have led Mike Pence, Vice-President, to win the war from the position and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased below Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea has fallen in South Korea since Kim Jong Un arrived in the area seven years ago.
The Byeong-seug Park, referring to the data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, said that 1127 people had escaped in the year 2011 compared with 2706.
Mr. Park said that they were a key factor in better border control between North Korea and China and a price increase required by silencers.
Pongjang hasn't made this public comment yet.
Most refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegal.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to overcome than a highly protected demilitarized area between the two of Korea.
China's count of refugees for illegal migrants and not for refugees is often severely repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South – which have been technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang at talks focusing on the suspension of the negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after a June historic meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong Unom in Singapore, where they generally agreed on the efforts for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, then, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong handed down the US sanctions for his detention.
"Without US confidence, confidence in our national security will not be trusted, and in such circumstances we will not be united," said Mr. Ri, under the command of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi marked Bretta Kavanaugh for "hissterical" and said that it was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court
The minority head of the representative's house Nancy Pelosi, a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, marked "historic" and acted that he was not significantly qualified for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosie did so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of anything else than that a woman would, if she did so, mark "historical," Kavanaugh's fourth speech was made before the Senate Commission's review.
Kavanaugh was furiously ignoring the charges that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were still in custody.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, often nearly involved and discussed his family and middle - aged souls.
He also strongly condemned democracy in the Commission, and the charges against himself were "great and coordinated" organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosie said that I believe that Kavanaugh's speech proved that he shouldn't be named as a Supreme Court, because it showed that he was a protester to the Democrats.
"I believe it has been discrepancy with such statements and ways of fighting Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosie's question is whether the opposition of Kavanaugh would try to file a constitutional complaint if it was confirmed and the democracies were to receive most in the representative's house for a moment.
"I will say so – if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court in which it is now," Pelosie said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Federal Appeals Court.
Pelosie has done so as a democratic concern about Kavanaugh's decision against the Law on Access to Health Care or the case of Roe against Wad, since it applies to a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would delay certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time to go hysterical, face-to-face, and expect us to say, 'Is that not wonderful?'," said Pelosie.
And the woman needs to be taken care of.
It's a fair outcome, after months and years of verbal abuse, and it can't express it without a cry.
"We cry when we're hungry," she said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, what do you think?"
She continued: “The woman who was a directory that was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, and that is, when she was upset and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘ Maybe I am sorry because I am crying.
I'm angry."
Then she just went on.
It seemed to me a lot higher."
The salts are as an exit for no more than a part of it because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories from early careers, when I was still working in the office where men were ruling, when I once found a jockey in an inexhaustible rage, was when an older woman grabbed me by the door – the cold water that I was always a few feet away from the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand that you're mad.
They will think that you are sorry, and they will rejoice that they have touched you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congressional from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was hit by a jump across the board in a corner called Monkey Business and had to get out of the game, he found that there was no reason why the president could not apply for it himself.
"This was not a well thought-out decision," I said 30 years later in my smile.
"There were already seven other candidates in the game and another one was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone then referred to the game as ‘Sneguljčica and seven arrows’.
Since the last campaign was joined, she stayed in the collection of funds, so she decided that she would not be in the race unless it was $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the man, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a break?" she asked.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings – the gratitude of the people who supported her, the discontent with the system that made her so hard to collect money and focused on voters instead of delegates, and her anger over sexism – were so overcome that she began to breathe.
"We'd think I'd have a nervous disorder," he said. Schroederev recalled the media's reactions.

How a war between the United States and China could be used by Beijing
The initial trade agreements between the United States and China have been overwhelming, and although the battle has not yet been over, experts say that it could be long-term use of Beijing.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched his first warning at the beginning of the year with the taxing of key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important issue took place this week with new goods prices of USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which effectively means the taxing of half of all goods coming into the United States of America from China.
Peking was constantly punished with equivalent recovery measures, last with rates of 5 to 10 per cent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving around with the United States and probably not to interfere soon.
In order to be able to leave Washington, China would have to agree to its demands, but it would be a public withdrawal from the United States for Chinese President Xi Jinping is too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knew how to withdraw the right movement, US pressure in the trade war would have long-term positive effects on China with a view to reducing the mutual dependence of both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic repression in any country is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far," said Abigail Grace, an expert associate who focuses on Asia at the brain trust of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, true Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for voluntary return of refugees, and requests for assistance in the restoration of the country, which has been abandoned for more than seven years in the war.
In his statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moual said that the situation in the country improved.
"Today conditions on the ground are more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to dream of areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
All the conditions have now been met to voluntarily return to the country, which had to be abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moulalem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the abandoned country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsored by sponsors.
Europe won victory in Ryder's palace in Paris
The European team won Ryder's win in 2018 with a final score of 16,5 against 10,5 at the Le Golf National game in Paris in France.
The United States has now lost sixfold on European soils, and Ryder's hotel has not won since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorna team reached 14.5 points needed for victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the premiers, died on 16th of July in a par-3 game at his initial hit by the goose, which made it necessary to deliver to Francescu Molinari.
The Italian golfist Molinari has spread across all sides and has become one of the four players who have ever achieved the score of 5-0-0 since the beginning of the initiative in the present form of 1979.
American Jordan Spieth won with 5 and 4 the lowest ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Jan Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's past.
Veteran of eight Ryder's gifts, Spain Sergio Garcia, has become the most powerful European player at all times.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he took me and trusted you.
So happy, I'm so happy that we won again.
It's for the team and it really makes me happy that I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The keynote address is to John Ramu, who won the American legend of the Tiger Woods golfer on Sundays 2 and 1 in individual games.
"I feel incredibly proud that I managed to defeat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods in France lost all four games he played, and now has a career record in Ryder's pool of 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistics for one of the largest players of all time, who won 14 great titles, immediately after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying hard every week to find the right way, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played golf all the time of the entire presidency.
The American captain, after a poor move for his team, said, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we pressed a couple of pressure on Europe.
We've been down.
The club down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to get together again, I'm going to work with the US PGA and our Ryder's Committee and move on.
I really like these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Get down.
We have been defeated."
