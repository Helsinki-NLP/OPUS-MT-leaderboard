Members of the Galles Assembly are worried that "they identify as Mupets"
Several members of the assembly expressed their consternation before the proposal for a amendment to their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Galaxles Parliament).
This Polish has come up against the plan to change the name of the assembly by the Gallares Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a cause of jealousy.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "recorded with Twp or Pwp".
For non-gallon readers: In galalés, twp means stupid and, pwp, excretion.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the party's group "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed various alternatives.
On his behalf, a Galchelles conservator said his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there is a very small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be said that the letter "w" in galleys is similarly pronounced in the letter "u" in English from Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee responsible for preparing the legal removal to introduce changes in names: "The final decision on any qualification to name the members of the assembly will inevitably fall within its own members."
The Law of 2017 of the Galchles Government gives the Galchles Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Galileo Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was deposed by "Members of the Galaxles Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was that it received more support in the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the House are suggesting different alternatives, however, the attempt to raise a consensus may assume a whole mess for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to be present on the change in the week.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes relating to the functioning of the Assembly, such as now standards on the dequa­calization of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final vote on their appointment during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in favour of the change in their country's name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether they want to change their country's name for "North Republic of Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a very long time on the fact that the name of its northern route represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the efforts of this country to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, contrary to the populace on the change in name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev now, believe that the change in name is simply the price to be paid to become EU and NATO members.
St. Martin's campaigns stop singing: the difficulties of the Harlem churches
" Historically, the great people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, don't stay here, both of you."
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have already left off being that kind of room for the neighbor where people went periodically."
As for the church, he's worried that the money that comes from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as their leaders "and that later or later they go back to where they came from."
The churches, it adds, could end up being replaced by apartments and condoms with the kind of people who will not have any help for the temples that remain in the bar.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and therefore what they will do will speed up the closure of all churches, since most people who move to these condoms have become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white man who had been in his early 30 ’ s left the white congregation.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Governor John Howard Johnson, who led a boy to the retail tradesmen of the 125th street, one of Harlem's main commercial streets, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the gladiators of the Reverence Johnson planned to rebuild it, it was then when they carried the cart.
Reverent David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, described the career as "the campaigns of the poor."
The expert who made the scroll sound the Julian described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also observed that it was also the first carillion in the world that was touched by a black race music, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carillion of the Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has sounded to St. Martin's during the past few months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them taken by the lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July all of its concern that diocese "proceeded to transfer costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some happy people have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A tower hits a 13-year-old boy while he was looking for refuge in California
A tower attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while he was making an intrusion to seek refuge in California on the first day of the refugee season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel explained to the KSWB-TV of San Diego, he spent half an hour busing with friends on Sunday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help. Then they stopped with a group until the boy was found to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy he had taken a lagoose, but then he realized that he was crying 'I've moved!'
I'm tired!'
He had all the stuck keyboard," observed Hammel when he arrived to the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I cried, 'There's a tube in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he got into a bad state.
You don't know what kind of storm is responsible for the attack.
In a press round, deputy Larry Giles commented that he had been working for a few weeks that a tower had been detected in the area, but it was decided that this kind was not dangerous.
Gilles added that the victim suffered traumatic wounds in the upper part of the tower.
The authorities closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of tuberculosis in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plans, to the United Kingdom's beautiful products market
Sansbury's decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large passes are only part of a considerable investment in the United Kingdom's beauty products market, a market that moves about 2800 million GBPs and that continues to grow while the fashion and country's products are behind, and they will be tested to 11 bottlenecks from all over the country to increase to more bottlenecks the year it sees if the test is successful.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the advertising of supermarkets to use the space in their past performances for televisions, microwaves and products in the country.
Sansbury's says he will double his beauty offer to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelin and Burt's Bees also provide more space with areas of markings similar to those that can be found on boots like Boots now.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relieving its range of Boutique makeup products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, a aspect more often demanded by younger consumers.
The minority chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two stores in Saninsbury's. The first one did it in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Internet shopping and changing a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day to small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Saninsbury's, bottlenecks will always be compared to large stores in an attempt on the supermarket chain to fight the Aldi and Lidl supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's gone for sale points from Argos to many of his supermarkets, plus a number of habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he said, has served to slow down the sales of waste and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt at the supermarket chain to relaunch its departments of beauty and pharmaceutical products resulted in a failure.
Sansbury did a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended prematurely without agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy came after the sale three years ago by Sansbury's business of 281 pharmaceuticals in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of product luxury brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four bottles.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sansbury's, comments: "We have transformed the aspect of our beauty products landscapes so as to improve the face environment for our customers.
We have invested in workers in specific formats that will be of great help at the time of offering insurance.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and reject the traditional way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "fry" after Holly Willoughby's behind an 11 million GBP deal.
Dragons' Star De Peter Jones went "furious" after Hollywood Willoughby's television show was made behind an 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand trade to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to spend in the joint sale of land products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had arrived compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old representative used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Star De Peter Jones enthusiast by withdrawing into the last minute of the joint business of life-style branding to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "frequent" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held at the center of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new bids of the presenter, at a value of 1.5 million GBP, meant that it would no longer have time to devote to the common brand of land products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to compare with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and hoped to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce his trip to Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his vacations outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly's main priority.
He was destined to be his future in the long run and where we would see him during his next twenty-three years.
His decision to go back left without words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a lot of stores in your Marlow center to be sold."
According to experts, the march of this morning's representative, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the important investment made in products, from kitchens and mirrors to clothes and clothes for the country, and from the possibility of delays for its release.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined the president's office last March.
In addition, Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm at the I'm Celebrity of the ITV program.
A source next to Jones commented yesterday that "We won't comment on his business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love with each other."
He made a joke of the possible criticisms he received from the media to make a comment that some would consider "a little bit of a president" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, all in a tone of voice by a news reporter:
"I didn't give up anything."
He observed that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are under way.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Sunday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" response by the US to the first disarmament initiatives undertaken by its country.
However, he noted that the US continues to apply sanctions with a view to maintaining the pressure.
Trump's point of view, in turn, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to declare war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we keep this big relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results: end of tests with missiles, help free hostages and return home from the rest of American soldiers.
And he defended his little habit of talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this recent crowd, we'd have about 200," said Trump, pointing out the crowd before him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared necessary in order to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have left it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so that the situation is very demanding," said Mrs. Sumong.
If, however, Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, rapporteur for the National Disasters Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies were allowed to contribute at the time of offering assistance.
Given the constant droughts that afflict Indonesia, the country remains in a state of low poverty prepared for the anger of nature.
Although Aceh has built shelters in case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of Indonesian islands is, in the best of cases, all a sudden.
And natural disasters make it even more difficult for logistics.
A hospital ship caught in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now headed to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was a central element of his electoral campaign to improve the poor infrastructure of Indonesia, and has invested enormous amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government is facing the year that comes to the re-election of funding deficits.
The game is also faced with the pressure of the country's permanent sectoral tensions, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative falling faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of wars between Christian and Muslim gangs with swords, bows, arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge del Liverpool makes the tip of the empat with a yellow hole in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of Chelsea with his head marked at 89th of a day in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri to about 27 metres from the Chelsea port when his team went missing from 1 to 0.
The pilot sat on the left before leaving an incredible suit directed towards the second suit.
The shooting created the whole area with a great rise as it was propelled to the right corner of the port.
The pilot finally started down over an Arrizabalaga Kepa in full swing to try to stop her and she ended up at the base of the network.
"I just tried to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it all along, so I tried to create the maximum possible time," Sturridge said in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté came, I made a joke, and I didn't think about it much, I just dedicated myself to gambling."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at the discount after marking a gol at 25 minutes through his Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the front of the Blue team returned a pass to Matthew Kovacic before starting almost half the camp and printing to Liverpool camp.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the camp.
After all, he did a great deep past, which left Hazard in the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard crossed the defense to finish the second suit with a left bed where he could not reach the port of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoles at the stage of groups of the Camping League next Tuesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play videoton at UEFA Europe League at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths for Indonesian tsunamis up to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the exposed buildings due to the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 that took place on Fridays and caused waves up to 6 metres, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press round.
The city of Palu, of the more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man as suspected of murder after finding a woman who was kidnapped.
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The woman, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 with several fines in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police have asked the residents of the area who have seen or heard something about the crime they are facing before the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statement, "While the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to everyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious, which is placed in contact with us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxis who have been able to catch anything through the car's board camera, which is in contact, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman's body they found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his room, but the police have informed him that no one has permission to enter or leave the building.
When he learned what had happened, he became disillusioned.
He's warning the residents that they'll spend hours until they can come in again.
He could feel like a police officer explained to a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the crying scene.
Don't stop repeating "It's terrible!"
At 14:00, two police vehicles were found in the area agreed to by another car parked outside.
A number of Romanian agents in the agreed area controlling the block of spaces.
It is requested that anyone who can have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call to 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 and e-mail the 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of the British Parliament was the last monument affected by the discussion about "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the purest style of the Taliban of many cultural and religious objects in England by their fans.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bugery" and a "recording attempt".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of states, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was never ordered nor until the end of Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for his past actions that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being remembered.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than not now, as a defence of the parliament before the external pressure, in his obvious case of monarchy.
Whether or not this event constitutes a fully-fledged Roman historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-first century conflict was consistent with the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a band of this division.
His assolations as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and remembered."
A pig killed by a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and still covered with blood near a piece of pigs on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, according to reports on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs into a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As you know, he had traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a piece of dirty pigs.
He said that in court there was a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg grain had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My hair had broken and filled with blood," said the cosy, known as "Wu," according to the news of Guiyang's evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. of days to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned nor owned by Yuan.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained closed and isolated so as to avoid any further attacks, while the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Even though it's very rare, there's previously been cases of human assaults.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, about 300 kg was caught by a galley farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC news that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "disappearing".
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of doing bad.
They just need to be given the respect they deserve," he commented.
The rest of Rosa's hurricane will bring torrential rains all the way south of the United States.
According to the pronoses, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it progresses over the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains across the north of Mexico and the south-east of the United States during the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, itself from Category 1, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, U.S. hour, and was located 620 km south-east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is starting to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start leaving a strong tropical humidity in the north-east direction of the US.
The Rosa will leave the moons up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
After all, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate torrential floods that are generalized throughout the south-east during the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, streams of waste and the possibility of land leaks in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause close to 50 to 75 mm precipitation indexes per hour at various points, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain to parts of the south-west, especially most of Arizona.
There's a chance that it's becoming riveted, since the situation is very fast because of the different character of the tropical raindrops.
It is entirely advisable to enter the desert just before the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential floods could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, the storms can carry wind and dust rats at specific points.
The depression that strikes will bring torrential rains at certain points from the south coast of California.
It is possible to record a total of precipitations over 50 mm, which could cause lower residue flows and relative paths.
It would be the first precipitation of the rain season in the region.
Tropical rain rates will begin to reach Arizona between Sunday night and Sunday morning, before the rain becomes more generalized between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Cantonians on Tuesday and will continue throughout the afternoon.
There will be several important temperature oscillations for all the United States as the Arctic cooled, though the tropicals will fall strongly cold.
This phenomenon can lead to dramatic changes in temperature in a little distance.
The Central region of the United States Sunday is a clear example of dramatic temperature differences.
Some 20 degrees of temperature have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the constant heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will start with great heat in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the south to the north-east.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities to record temperatures above average in the US east during the first half of October.
More than 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw the passionate witness of the candidate to a member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was supposed to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was sent back to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political force continued, with the issuers interrupting the usual Sunday programming due to a series of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arison Jeff Flake because the FBI is conducting a case-by-case investigation for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh had touched her out and tried to get her clothes off at an institute's party.
Kavanaugh, in a high witness, said he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC viewers.
The auditing figures were not immediately available for other cadets that were retransmitted to the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen's only got problems at the time of counting the people he's seen from his office.
In perspective, it is a similar audience to a party of American football players or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the chain with more audiences, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the whole day witness, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS achieved 3.1 million, the NCB 2.94 million, the MSNBC 2.89 million and the CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
Interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of the Sunday drama.
After the moderated republican office issued a communiqué saying that they voted in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was incribed by demonstrators when he was trying to get up to an elevator to go to a court hearing.
Flake had a couple of minutes with the naked eye while he was getting back directly from CNN TV.
"Here you have me, before you," said a woman.
"You think you're telling the truth to the country?
They told him you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!"
Flake said his office had hired a communiqué and, before closing the elevator doors, said he'd have more to say in the Committee's view.
Within hours, all cable and diffusion chains were being forwarded directly to the time when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate's plenary to vote.
Flake said, on the other hand, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the appointment of face to the week that he saw, the condition required by the majority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations that she had with her friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made her decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation for allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses the critics of "swearing politics" in relation to Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to leave the European Union to "go politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to reduce national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended a Conservative Party convention in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a further interview with May at the end of the day, the former Foreign Minister of May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he says that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU are repeatedly withdrawing taxes is "by far the absurd."
Killed by Wayde Sims: Police stop Dytheon Simpson's suspect for the death of the LSU team's player
The police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who fought in the LSU team.
Dytheon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and sent to a murder-related prison, according to the baton Rouge police department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his eyes during the battle.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claimed they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS WAFB's report.
After asking Simpson, he admitted that Wade had died of a stroke, according to the police.
His loan is set at $350,000, according to the lawyer's report.
The East Baton Rouge District Forensic Office published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a weapon wound to the head towards the neck.
The department appreciates the operational refugee group of the state police in Louisiana, the state's crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the assistance provided in the investigation that has taken place in this detention.
LSU's export director Joe Aleva expressed his appreciation to the forces in the area order for his "diligence and to seek justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
In the middle of 1,98 meters, he played to go and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player in the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces from the past period.
On Sunday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach commented that the team is "damaged" and that Wade's death was "a very strong time".
"It's like these are the ones who hurt you all the time," said Wade.
A scaffolding Volcano in Mexico City
The fall from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern bars of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on the Sabbath that they would stay away from the volcano after they had been active in the crater and 183 gas emissions were recorded and spent 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several strokes and traumas that had recently occurred.
Images on social networks where a fine set of car parades is appreciated in Mexico City bars like Xochimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists a little before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Thursday after protesters in favor of independence faced with the anti-avalot police and thousands of people joined in protests to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalunya on his session.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avalot police began throwing eggs and painting them into dust, causing the presence of dark clouds of dust in the streets normally sealed by tourists.
Later the same day, there was a riot with the police, who used their bags to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" face-to-face with Unionists who called "Long life in Spain".
Four people had to be attacked by injuries suffered during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of independent thinking a year after a referendum was held on 1 October that was considered illegal by Madrid but also due to the end of the Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation index was low, since the opposition to the session voted mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote by entering the electoral colleges throughout the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night in order to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration took place at the same time, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of the possibilities of Catalunya associating independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw how my parents were happy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, however, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain this year's fine, since many of their leading leaders are in a self-imposed exile or detention in hopes of being judged by their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, writes the police support demonstration on his phone, and says the conflict has led to both sides' politics.
"The tension only increases," he says.
On Thursday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial at the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate to the European elections is the best way to declare the retreat in democratic values and the repression we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after building a house with a car
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age have been arrested after a car repeatedly committed against a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent the day before 19:30 a.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a ballast against the car.
A Menga game that gives the victory to Livingston for 1 to 0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
Livingston, who had graduated from the class this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which it is just the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 parties as the trainer of the Ibrox bar club.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team can take the second position, which they share with the Hebrews.
Gerard's men, on the other hand, continue without winning home at the Premiership this time, the next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them from eight points.
But before that, the Rangers get this day the Viena Speed in Europe League.
Livingston, in the meantime, extends up to six parties his rat invasive to the league, with a Holt as a trainer who still doesn't know what the defeat is since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitor's direct game
Holt's team should have gone in front of the marker long before the goal, since his direct game caused all kinds of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he missed his chance when he found himself in front of the gate. Then, Alan Lithgow sent the pilot out trying to finish Craig Halkett's head, who created the gate.
The locals were already going to let the Rangers go to their area, as they knew that visitors could be in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive gorilla got here.
The archipelago was a failure against the interests of Rangers, and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined because Menga could play it first and finish it from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but he found himself with an impenetrable defence and a porter Liam Kelly who had a little work along the party,
The scene was repeated on the second side, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop the murder.
For his part, the Rangers porter Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an opportunity from Scott Pittman and Lithgow ran away from another Livingston combination game.
The Rangers dedicated himself to punish once and for another pilots in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two prisoners were charged, one for a alleged entrance from Halket to Glenn Middleton's replacement, and the other for hands.
Livingston "fenominal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great action and great success for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they're still going through all the expectations of this rising trajectory.
His style of play and almost never changed from his return to the highest category, although most of the merit has to be attributed to Holt in the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be in Menga's custody all the time.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the bright moments with Gerard as a trainer, they have certainly not been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly exceeded local defense), and that Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Agrarian reception for Erdogan in Colonia
All were clear shadows and skyscrapers on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met to breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the Polish visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These have been weakened by human rights issues such as now, the freedom of press and Turkey's invasion of the EU.
Erdogan, however, moved to Colonia to renew a new giant mix.
And this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police set up security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers were applied to the rounds so that they could see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them deaf, also felt as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to grant him a welcome welcome to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero for some German Turks and a titled dictator for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist died in a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the top of the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street streets, an area with a transit force from Deptford, south of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics were waiting for the cyclist, he died on the scene.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a case of escape at Childers Street, 1.6 km from the scene of the accident on Sunday.
The Metropolitan Police said their agents are working to identify the man and inform the relatives of the facts.
The road has been cut down and deviations have been applied to bus routes. In addition, drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long Lattin Prison: six wounded agents in an altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an alternative in this high-security prison center, according to the center's office.
The facts were produced in Long Lardin prison, Worcestershire, at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still missing.
Specialized "turned" agents were moved to the location of the events to end the shift, where eight prisoners were seen involved. The aircraft could be held by a band.
The agents had to be shot for injuries to the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison guard: "We have deployed special-trained prison personnel to try to solve an incident caused by Long Martin prison, which is still missing.
Six employees must have been wounded.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We must be sure that those responsible for this change will be kept accountable to the police and may have to spend more time in the custody."
There are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals, in the prison centre of Long Lartin.
In June, he learned that the prison chief had to be in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-evaluators took action to get to the prison to solve a serious change in which the center staff were attacked with billboard balls.
Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important rivers (areas that could otherwise benefit)
It's not normal that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that's exactly what it's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that you see when what remains of the Rosa hurricane passes through the desert of the south-west, with the resulting risk of rivers.
The national meteorological service has already been warned by rivers for Mondays and Tuesdays in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and that it will be close to the night of Monday with tears.
The national meteorological service of Phoenix commented in a Piulada that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of tension or tropical depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the national centre of hurricanes provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they will be registered up to 150 mm in the Arizona Mogolon.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central Rocalos and the Great Conca, could be recorded from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas beyond the risk of rivers, the rain of Rosa could become a very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although the rivers are a major cause of concern, some of the precipitations could be very beneficial, as the region of the south-west is currently suffering a drought.
According to the U.S. sequential control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers as at least extreme, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Rosa shall touch the ground in the pool of Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa continued to be strong on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes me lose my strength.
So it's expected to touch the land in Mexico with a tropical storm at night or at night.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a significant risk of routing.
According to weather.com, "expects 75 to 150 mm of total rain from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 250 mm".
After that, Rosa will head north believing Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona in the first hour of the morning with tropical depression, to finally create the state of Arizona and to the south of Utah well entered the night of the Tuesday.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what remains of him is very strong precipitation in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west desert of the US," according to the national centre of hurricanes.
It is estimated that the floods cause dangerous rivers and streams of waste in the deserts, but also earthquakes in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four hostages attempting to kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy has been found in Somerset.
The teenager was found with wounds in the Middle East Highlands area, at 4:00 a.m., at the local time.
It was transferred to the hospital, where it's "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two of 18 and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in Radstock's area, according to Avon and Somerset's police.
The agents have made a call because anyone who can have any kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone is in contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the hypocrisy and anger" of the democratic party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rebuff to the bitter and inignant tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump declared in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "pained the mix and anger" of the democratic party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh declared before the Congress daily, denying consistently and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's claim that she had been sexually abused decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also declared the view in relation to his allegation.
The president said on that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the validity" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most bright thoughts in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an amazing trajectory of service in the city," said many sympathetic people in West Virginia.
The president referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the index of participation of Republican voters in the election of half of the mandate.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obscenity".
It is expected that the first procedural vote that will be held at the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as soon as Friday, according to a representative of the party's leaders informed CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
As at least 384 people have died, and many have been arrested by the giant waves that were shouting against the beaches, due to a terrible earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Sundays due to a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters affected the coast of the capital, shooting many people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people were still going to finish their activities on the beach and they didn't run after it. That's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the leader of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, broke cars, trolls, houses, destroyed everything on earth," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who got up on a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of damaged goods and buildings, bridged and exposed bridges and a mix of water is appreciated.
The response continued on Saturday morning in this coastal town.
The earthquake series were heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The assessment and application agency of Indonesia's technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the earthquakes on Friday was 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bath, could have increased exponentially the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the dangers as "considerable" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels were scattered.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found hidden between the ruins of the exposed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 displaced.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damages could increase to the coast about 300 km north of Palu, a area called Donghea, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and so there was no kind of information" in Donghea, Nugroho says.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Creu in a statement, adding that his workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could hardly end much worse," I think.
The agency was strongly criticized on Sunday for not informing of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, even though the agents said that the waves arrived during the time the notice was issued.
In a recording of an affidavit shared in social networks, it can be felt like a man on the top floor of a building giving desperate warnings to people on the street about the tsunami that is happening.
In the matter of minutes, a water wall is hidden beyond the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate the registration immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general cut in electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, refugees continue to urgently need food, as well as other basic needs.
The city's airport has been opened only for relief tasks and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the summer centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death figure for Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
It's very difficult.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donghea were able to reach the city of Palu without being able to escape, the employees paid for refugee shelters from lanna installed at the foot of their office, Doseba says during the course they had to present scenes of total destruction.
"I said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a disaster.
Although the relief groups had done the dissolute management of starting relief tasks, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While he was crying the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, friends and family of the missing people maintained the hope of the miracle and their loved ones elucidated the devastating report of natural disasters.
On Sunday, a boy was rescued in a locker.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the run for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandon, the trainer of the Indonesian national team of parapents, had trained two of the missing parapenists for Asian Games, which were concluded early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandiya, among the people arrested at Roa Roa Roa, there were his students.
"As a senior in the parapet area, I have my own emotional burden," he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the fact that he was passing the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Roa hotel between the parapentist community, he had unexpectedly sent messages from whatsApp to Palu's competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appear with a gray check mark instead of a double blank mark.
"I think this means that messages were not received," he added.
Several chains carry $26,750 while filling an automatic box at Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a worker from Brink's who was filling up an automatic wallet in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Department of Police in Newport.
Agent Dennis McCarthy pointed out to the communiqué that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the automatic boxer to the maintenance complex and was preparing it for more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "he got running behind Brink's employee" and stole a lot of money for the distribution.
According to the report, the witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about his identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change to Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
Some time ago, 41-year-old West had the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eight album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, where it is expected that there is its new album, entitled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation by "emotional motives", according to the author of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West at the beginning of this year, while talking about the title of his album to the video player Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us.
I've gone through Kanye, which means the only one, just Yes, that's a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more easily a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has met him with several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-laborator, has been valued by his nicknames with or without a guide and a maesculin.
Mexico's President, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The President-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is required because the country is completing the 50th anniversary of a cruel repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Sunday at Tlatelolco's place that "the military force would no longer be used to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when the student movement on the left was approaching Latin America.
Lopez Obrador, who has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the attitude and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel trapped by criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to IA
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the North American Government have announced IA measures, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in IA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become world number 1 for innovation in IA in 2030.
"Dublining the budget for IA research would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are very behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the real progress in the IA field," Lee said.
"Dublining funding could double the opportunities that the US would attach to the next major discovery in IA," Lee told the CBC in an interview held this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the company Synovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent companies in China.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that exceeded Othello's American player with the best rating and later served as executive to Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively appreciated previous technological competitions by the Government of North America, such as now the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when it would take place next to identify the own visionaries.
"Most often, North American researchers have to work long enough to get public benefits," Lee said.
According to Lee, "it's not China that drives academic leaders; they're businesses."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have engaged in university emulations to work in the IA field.
Lee commented that the role of the US in the IA could also be seen driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think you should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the state Council of China presented its latest generation's Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funds to persons of academic institutions in the same way that the U.S. Foundation of Natural Sciences and other public agencies give money to North American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
At the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Defence created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to participate in the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Artificial Intelligence Committee.
Moreover, this month the DARPA announced an investment of 2,000 million USD in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Foundation of Natural Sciences, it is currently spending more than 100 million USD per year on IA research.
Meanwhile, months ago no measure was applied in relation to North American legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide whether they change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the name change in the Northern Republic of Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a dispute that had existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its north-east route constitutes a claim of its territory and has invited it to join NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would save the ethnic identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has shown that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether it will be at least 50% of the necessary participation since the referendum will be valid.
The question mentioned in the referendum paper is, "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The parties to the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to speed up Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that were created following Yugoslavia's deintegration, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote today for the future of the country, because Macedonia's young people can live freely within the European Union, because it means that we all will have a safer life," Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that it will result in the vote to make it a decision.
In order to change the name, a majority of two-thirds of Parliament is required.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 13 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66 per cent of the recorded people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, in the capital, Skopje.
First Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the change in the country's name, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would book the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of European integration."
First Minister Zaev states that NATO's incorporation will be accompanied by more investment than you need in Macedonia, which has a rate of higher than 20%.
"I think the great majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev showed that a "yes" would assume the "confirmation of our future".
In a published survey last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure under the minimum participation required.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of the respondents are planning to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, participation must be of 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would assume the first difficult time for the proocdential government's policy since it took place the month of May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Ağoro, from Manchester City, takes a bullet after all the Bridgeton defense
Sergio Ağero and Raheem Sterling announced the defense of Brighton in Manchester City's victory for 2 to 0 in the party at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Sunday.
Aguro marked a gol at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The front silver received a pass in the middle of the camp at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran at a speed between three Brighton's defenses, dragging what came out to him through the game field.
Then Aguro saw himself surrounded by four green shrubs.
He ordered a defense before he crossed some more on the bridge area.
Then he made a pass on his left that he found Sterling.
The former English returned the pilot to the first touch, inside the area, to Aguro, which, with the right leg, struck the gate of Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a hole that ran into the inside of the network on the right.
"Aguero has trouble at all," said Pep Guardiana, a city trainer, to journalists.
"We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky I've marked a bullet at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in fighting for the First League.
His gol arrived at the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguro received the pilot deep in the Brighton camp and
He made a beautiful passage through space for the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before passing her to Sterling's long suit.
The Sky Blues front ended the pilot inside the network before leaving for the background line.
The City faces a Tuesday at Hoffeneheim in the stage of the League Championships groups at 18:55 a.m., in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the fight for play-off, there was no reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, is waiting to come out to the launch mount Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, if the Rockies, who hold an advantage over the English Dodgers in the West National League, have the opportunity to play the playoff.
The Rockies secured a comfort with the victory for 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking for their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can go out to launch the environment here, in Denver, and know that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this party?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launch for Sunday, but they seem to be willing to let Scherzer leave if this situation occurs.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a daily heating session and would launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-hand launch has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strip removals in 220 2/3 entries this time.
Trump makes a meeting in West Virginia
The president referred directly to the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the participation of republicans in the election of half-mand.
"All we've done is in play in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great, great. I don't present, but I actually do. That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power for all the means necessary, they are seen as their blending, their evil intent.
They don't care who's doing evil, about who they're going to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is "stop and stop."
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he protested, and he titled the democracies of "unnuts, machetes, gross and false."
Trump highlighted Diane Feinstein, the highest democratic senator of the Senate's Judicial Committee, who had provoked a strong written public opinion.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... this was a very painful physical language expression, the worst physical language I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party has stopped being a different party.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it didn't surprise me.
In the end, I'm the last of a series of British parliamentarians who told us that we were not welcome, all to say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because he showed determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censorship, I was criticized for disclosing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe.
In the wake of the meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party on Friday, it was reported that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local parliamentarian, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long been forgotten about the promise of "more generous and kind politicians", if it ever existed.
It is always more obvious that divergent opinions do not tolerate the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as his former colleagues thought he was sharing a political vision, hoping that I would make a 180th round and take positions that would never have been adopted, either on national security or on the single EU market.
When I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my application is not renewed, they are accused of central policies and I am told that it shouldn't be the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I receive are often political.
I'm impressed by the professionality and determination of the colleagues who have to face a torrent of existing and racist attacks every day, and they don't go down.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this was politics is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so different, and with every "non-trust" movement or every change in selection standards, the party became more extreme.
In the last two years, I have received much advice and have recommended that I keep my head down, that it wasn't so expressive and "all would be fine."
But I didn't get involved in politics for that.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 years ago, in my time of studying, inspired by that strange government, which left my whole class literally in focus, I try to defend better public services for those who need it, whether as a local adviser or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will damage the lives, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to deliver did not lead to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, either workmen or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of not renewing my application or any political interest will prevent me from acting, according to my father, in the interests of all of you.

John 38 - 17 Melrose: One of the heads of the governing body
Two last-hour attempts have broken the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs have increased the victory in this vital part of the Tennt's Premiership's day.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of ten, take the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team thanked its defence superiority and that he knew better to take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The parties we've played so far have tested us and still go on, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Blessed for the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's test at 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, put before the Ayrs, but a rough map for the Scottish international Rory Hughes, cast for the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority, and Jason Baggot recorded an unconverted test.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just in the middle, recorded and converted an attempt to put the Ayr marker 17-5 in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Then the party stopped for a long time because of the severe injury that happened to Ruardh Knott, which was withdrawn in a letter, and the Ayrs again expanded the distance with a test by Stafford McDowell converted by Climo.
Next, the supple captain Blair Macpherson was amnesty with a rough card, and again, the Melroses enjoyed the superiority of a more man with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a strong press moment.
However, the local team responded, and when Sruan Hutchinson saw a rough map to make a beach in Climo without a pilot, from the sanctions alignment, MacPherson recorded a password behind the airstrip.
Climo noticed, as he had done nearly since the repression, after Kyle Rowe collected a piece of David Armstrong and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to record the five local team searches.
The Still Game series star seems to be about to launch a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be about to pass into the hotel sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company with a license.
The actor, 56 years old, interprets Jack Jarvis's character in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-proteinizes with Greg Hemphil, his best friend for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of Afförmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source of The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "floint sector of the restoration" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, without the coast, expects the court to reopen the road to the Pacific
Marines patrol for their ship covered with ice in La Paz.
Public buildings hold a sea blue flag.
The bass from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are empathized with the theme: "The sea is our right.
Getting it back is a debt."
Around Bolivia's unliterated territory, the memory of a lost coast in front of Xile in a conflict of resources that is going on in the 19th century continues to feel very alive, as it is the anchor of re-boarding for the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and seriousness, and, not to say, wait with a positive position the result," pointed Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TJ resolution in large screens around the country, with the hope that the Hague Court has declared in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Xile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the Indian charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a Polish struggle for re-election the year he sees, also has many hopes set out in the resolution on Mondays.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favor of Bolivia and that if it did, things would not change very much.
The United Nations organization based on the Netherlands has not been able to assist small territories and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The IJ resolution, which was produced only six months after the final statements were submitted, indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert at international law.
And far from seeing her in favor, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has secreted the issue of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
"The beautiful rhetoric of Morales has mined any good-willed gesture by Xile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Xile will continue talking for a while, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries did not exchange Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in La Haia, rejected the idea that the Tribunal's decision was extremely rapid.
The next Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Xile" and an opportunity to "lay up to 139 years of discretion, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be produced unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The Minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a moment when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo is about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a shame to think that the continued sanctions and the United States objection to a declaration that put an end to the Korean War can make North Korea ever worse.
Washington is disappointed to accept the statement if Pyongyang doesn't make important disarmament movements before.
Both Kim and president. North American Donald Trump wants to celebrate a second.
However, there is a generalised exception to the fact that Pyongyang takes seriously the issue of giving up an arsenic that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second camera between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashions reveal the last range of large size bars, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of bars or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to her in the past a range of extraordinary barrets of disproportionate sizes from their SS19 collection, which included the style defined at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been attracted by very few practical barriers, and these designers have brought their amazing creations into the past.
The most prominent part of Valentino was an exhilarated beech barret, decorated with a wide area, with a plome form, which turned the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were happy sandwiches, a barbecue and, even, a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the hot head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extraordinary masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of live colors, had costumes and seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than not high costumes.
A creation was similar to a full team of submarinism, with tubes and glasses, while another seemed like an empty gelatant.
And if you keep the big trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge bars could be installed on the main streets near you.
Large-scale bars handle "the Bomba", a wooden bar, with two feet wide open, which everyone has brought from Rihanna to Emily Rattakowski.
The label of worship behind the barret so little practical that it was scattered through the social networks brought another great creation to the pass: a wooden box for the beach, almost as big as the model with the bathroom that carried it.
The graphic box, of dark taronja color, decorated with scratches and finished with a white leather nose, was the most prominent part of the collection La Rivera SS19 from Jacquemus on the week of the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to F.D.: "I hope to see people carrying large bars and plate boxes on the main streets the next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity to ignore the demand of large-scale accessories.
John Edward: Language competencies are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain an academic excellence trajectory that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exams, which is strengthened with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are working to provide a service of the best level for students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for later and higher studies, for their careers, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desired electoral matter in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the enguana exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with higher qualifications in independent schools.
68 per cent of the students who studied foreign languages received note A above.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students received a higher A qualification in Mandarí, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, such as electoral assignments, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the United Kingdom Employment and Competition Commission revealed that for the reasons why entrepreneurs gave them the cost of covering vacations, 17% contributed to the lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more potential jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that a person pursues, if he pursues a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like this.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of your competence.
According to a survey carried out in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% could not speak a foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for children today.
Learning a variety of languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find an important job.
There is a difference between schools in Scotland and what they teach in languages.
Some schools focus more on the more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, towards 2020, such as the Japanese or the Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he will always be able to choose between a series of languages in independent schools, which are staffed by a specialist teacher in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what the future holds.
In the global commercial environment of the present time, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital for the country's future, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication competencies".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
You have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Independent Schools Council
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
The wait has virtually ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play the first premier party against the Demer Nuggets in San Diego tomorrow.
But they still have to figure out the minutes they're gonna play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton to the Lakers' official.
Mike Trudell, editor of the Lakers, killed that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the training of the principles of this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six early Lakers.
"I don't need pre-primary parties at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trump mix in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a campaign campaign tonight at Wheeling, Virginia, West.
It's the first of five Trump's programmings for the next week, which includes visits to sympathetic places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for confirmation for its candidate to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump seeks to obtain support for the next half-mandate elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
What time is Trump's match in West Virginia this night, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, Virginia, West, is scheduled for 19 a.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The mix of Trump in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via direct video transmission via YouTube.
It is likely that Trump withdrew the hearing initiated this week with the candidate named at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was under arrest for sexual abuse charges against him, while the expected confirmation vote of the Senate was pending until one week and the FBI investigated the case.
But the main goal of this round of talks is to help the Republicans who are present at the delicate November elections to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five talks from President Trump's campaign scheduled for the next week are directed to "encourage volunteers and sympathetic people, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, at the time we are headed for a time of campaign," said a porter from Trump who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
This evening's meeting, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather sympathetic "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time Trump visited Virginia in the West, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate republikat at the West Virginia Senate, who is experiencing adverse results in the polls.
"It's not a good signal for Morrisey that the president has to come to push him into the race," said Simon Haeder, politician of the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: North American team shows its ambition to keep alive the hope of face to individual Sunday parties
After three different sessions, Saturday afternoon's forums were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The bascult pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
"They've got a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive track," Jordan Spieth said while leaving at the end of the day.
Clearly, Europe has a advantage, four points forward, with twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little to their liking and has many reasons to be animated, largely by the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both count with three points four.
Spieth has been relative from tea to green and is setting an example.
The guitar screams of celebration rose from intensity as he continued his turn and stood a crucial spot to embody the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two forts.
He celebrated the poem that made them win the party at Fort 15 with a similar scream, which indicates that he believes that the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to do your best and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 forts to leave print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the incredible feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but praiseworthy European couple bear four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey Sunday morning, and also avoided Sunday mornings and Friday evenings, and the last nine fortnights in the morning.
For this result and the way its energy seems to flow to and from public bubbles, it is reaffirmed that they are players on a Sunday battle, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
It prefers both at the same time in different places.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's forums, who made him a partner with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the new first forts put the Spanish and Swedish into a hole where they never had any choice to go out.
The next day, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The forums and forums are very fascinating to see for the interaction between the devices, the advice they give and those they do not give, and the way a strategy can change from time to time.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this forum session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have asked.
Europe at the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable 10-6 marker
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after the end of the holidays and Sundays with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspiration of two formats for Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and to leave his record, up to the time, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, captain of Thomas Bjorn, who aimed to preserve the trophies that had been lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team slightly concorded in the morning's forums and put the series on 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the forums and won two parties, but they could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points to 12 individual Sunday parties to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European debate that achieves four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood after a week's sensitization, are only the second couple who win four points in their first four parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After spending Woods and Patrick Reed in the suburbs, they called for a brilliant act to beat a Woods deinflate and American depravity Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been arrested on two Sundays, showed spores of sporadic genius, but he lost 19 of the 29 parties in furballs and fursoms, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in the breakfasts in the morning, returned to work with Henrik Stanson on the ovens and fell by 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have all of this in a pleasant and windy day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament campaign, and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for Americans getting two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the suburbs and, later, they won Poulter and Rory McIllroy for 4 to 3 in the suburbs, after losing the first two forts.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history a team had raised a difference of four points to individual parties, although Furyk's team, the champion of the title, just needs to emulate to preserve it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems like a day-to-day attack that you see is out of your ass.
North Korea states that no one will be unarmed “in any way” if they don't appreciate signs of trust
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs announced to the United Nations that continued sanctions were intensifying its distrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had taken "greatly good will" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demanding the nuclear testing centre and committed itself not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we observe no response in the US consensus," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
If Ri re-taken North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to a "per phase" denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps in parallel, his statements seemed significant because it did not reject the full unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim committed to working in the "Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formalize the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has reported that prior to Pyongyang, it must eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to ease the heavy international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization must first be produced and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, in addition to countering the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions will make us angry is a quarter of the people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Moon Jae-in South Korean leader in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stage of extinction".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what it had kept last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that focusing on the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled "Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
According to the United Nations, Trump, that last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take disarmament measures, but showed that she still has much to do and the sanctions have to be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Yesterday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if two years, three years or five months are taken."
China and Russia support that the UN Security Council should pre-primary Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue with and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization".
The Security Council has imposed sanctions in North Korea unanimously since 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of the ballistic and nuclear missiles programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then reported that he would come back to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang the month of July saying that progress had been made, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "the own requests of a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon held this month, North Korea committed itself to disarming a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consensual measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "consensual measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students make a course on rest habits
Enguany, a new course at Harvard University has allowed his students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight culture, more and more, to study all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic observed that students at the University of Number or the World are often disappointed by the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after having a discussion about the impact that his privacy had on learning.
"At the end of the conversation, a girl approached me and said, "Why are they telling me now, all of this in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sound, which surprised me," reported the newspaper The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts about how good habits of music improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffer from a severe loss during the week.
The course, for an hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there's an image of a sleeper, where students have to click on coffee, potatoes, potatoes and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects the sports performance of the lack of sound, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sound privacy can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the camps with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily course.
"We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as a person has the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes for health," Professor Czeisler pointed out.
The culture of pride to keep awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and pressure increase the students' suffering that the privacy of the sound is a problem increasingly.
To enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid weight gain, as the privacy of his brain puts him in an innination mode and makes students always win.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course throughout the camp.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to implement a program of similar studies before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they are alarming when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "white light" that emits electronic screens and LED lights, which can change the harmony of the circular rhythm and cause sound problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's gol ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's gol condemns Steven Gerard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house, which assumes another suspect outside.
The group of Ibrox sought to sum up their first victory at home from the triumph of the past February 4 to 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked the second defeat in Gerarrd in 18 parties as a trainer to leave his team in the derivatives, at 8 points from the Hearts, unfavourable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga recorded the goal seven minutes before the middle part, and it never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, was about to match the marker.
While Rangers now falls to the sixth place, Livingston takes the third position, behind the Hebrew for a difference of waves.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a wound to the head caused by an object that appeared to be dropped from the grade.
Gerard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that the Ayrs threw into the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleventh title that started a point against the Hearts last week.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston became more dangerous when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should've marked the two-minute party, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone before Allan McGregor, but the migcampist laughed suddenly and took advantage of the great opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' missing launch met with Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only made a quick cut in the later skin.
The Rangers did control, but they seemed to have more hope than believe in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but Arbitr Steven Thomson ignored Colombia's claims.
The Rangers only drove two shots to the front gate, but the first porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the doctor before Ovie Ejaria.
While the first play of the Livi could have been against the race for 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't break up with Jacobs' workmate.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard took action at the break in changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent. The change had an impact practically immediately, since the extreme had taken a break in Morelos, although impertinent Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have sent the direction to the final stages, but McGregor kept standing to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a sudden cut from the corner.
The replacement of the Rangers Glenn Middleton still demanded a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made the big eyes.
German: Geiger Computer Inventor
And now a page of "Sunday Morning" Germanic: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physical of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave place to the device we know as the Geiger computer.
Counter Geiger, who has been a science pillar since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, such as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", protagonized by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly failed physical vacuum cleaner:
Man, "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger accountant, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these auriculars, you can listen to the effects of atoms that generate radioactivity in minerals."
Evans says, "I'm sure he's clear now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of the treatment
Method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient and modifying them to the laboratory
You can see a common protein in many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells, saw the ovary cancer that had passed on for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient, modifying them to the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein is present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then re-inject them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we've achieved suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 protein "failures the growth of various types of cancer," including mother, ovarian, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "instructing" these cells like treating cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West broke into a pro-Trump diaphragm with a MAGA gor after her act on the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written to the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a catholic act in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said it would be presented to the 2020 elections.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a dress from Make America Great Again, he began to criticise the Democrats and repeat his support in Trump.
"I always talk to white people say to me: How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, where Hollywood's star was a witness to Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee for sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it didn't show up, the eater Chris Rock picked up the recording of West's disapproval on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to redefine West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that it was not treated well between vessels because of the dirt he was wearing.
"I was threatened by bastards.
They told me you didn't come out with that shit.
I'm an asterisk.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said he would put Superman's sword because that's why they couldn't tell him what to do." "Do you want the world to go on?
Try to love."
His comments provoked public writers at least twice, and the program team members seemed ashamed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained to the publication, "The whole study was completely mute."
West took it as a replacement for Ariana Grande's last hour, the ex of which, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a good part of the audience with the interpretation of the song and Love it, decorated with Perrier's ampoule.
West got the reception of the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who threatened: "To one of the most brave spirits: Thank you for putting it into the MULTITUD."
But the chairman of the debate programme, Karen Hunter, threatened that West was just "be who it is and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by giving support to his "art") that I think he's adopting and spreading an ideology that damages my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had been changed and that he was now "the first known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, before he was called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince's music changed his name by a symbol and, later, the artist known earlier as Prince.
Murder in an attempt to rape a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was shot in the east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will be compared to the first instance of Belfast Tuesdays.
The tax will review the charges.
The throne star, Kit Harington, claims a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of army Jon Snow in the violent media fantasy series of HBO Trolls.
However, the actor, in his 31-year-olds, has denounced the virile heroic stereotype, saying that these papers make it clear that young boys often believe they have to be strong enough to be respected.
In an interview with the Culture magazine of The Sunday Times, Kit said that he believed that "something was going wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who's recently married to the co-protagonist of the throne game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted to be strongly determined to deal with this problem.
"I personally wonder where we've been wrong about what it does to masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development about the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can be a part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its virility.
He added, "What's innet and what's acquired?
What does TV and the streets teach young people to feel that they have to have this kind of violence?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
'Cause there's no doubt something wrong with young boys."
At the interview, he also admitted that he wouldn't do any sermons or follow-up of a throne game when the end of the series is scheduled for the next stage, saying he's made of battle and horses.
Since November, Kit will promote a restoration of Sam Shepard's True West work, which explains the history of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his friend Rose is the best thing he's ever given him a throne game.
"I knew my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," he said.
Rose did the role of Ygritte, the love of character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in the winning series of Emmy's fantasy.
The couple opposed their marriage in June 2018 at Leslie’s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in 14% of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only the second quarter of 2018 announced 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in some areas of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who fight HIV for this cause has been reduced almost zero, according to Chinese health officials' statements at a conference in Yunnan province.
Last year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was eliminated in China in 1997, but discrimination in the LGBT collection is common.
Taking into account the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from the Republic Party's senators and decomposes "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the requests prompted them critically and websites on the right.
"Thinks, lies, and more meny-prosperable lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
Apparently, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of Utah's Utah's senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information appeared online daily and was published by someone unknown to the Capitol during a session of the Senate's committee on sexual abuse charges against the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanugh.
The information was filtered after three senators were questioned by Kavanaugh.
Conservative locations, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was related to the Waters office and revealed information from a member of Waters' staff, accused the Capitol.
"This unfathomable accusation is completely false and a pure lie," said Waters.
"The member of my staff, identity, personal data and security that has been compromised because of these false and false accusations, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This unfounded complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated criticisms online, including the press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This negation is full of indignity," Fleischer wrote.
"This makes you think you don't have the time to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
You don't have to show a challenge.
You don't have to question the reasons for the driver.
You have to keep calm and sir."
Fleischer seemed to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to which critics accused of being too angry during the daily session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presenting to pass Waters on the media elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's important if it's true," he cried.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these false statements.
"We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions they have done and that they have damaged everyone and every member of my staff."
Johnny's Critics English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's limited storage parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reflection of the Frenchness of Johnny English's share-cedia parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, not an exception.
Will this humorous self-sustainment about how menysproblems are going to be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the incompetence of wools and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to burn everything. His name indicates more than anything else that is a chemical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glambre, has a bit of Clouseau, a point by Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy that brings a single note on the theme of Carros of fire at the Inaugural Olympic Games in London 2012.
Initially, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson journey that represented the now forgotten news on Barclaycard's television, where he was going to sow the chaos around.
There's one or two good moments on this final JE trip.
I loved Johnny English who was wearing a helicopter dressed in a medieval armory, and the helms of the halica were thrown back into the box.
There's the reason Atkinson has for the physical comedy, but humor seems quite fluid and extremely superfluous, especially because cinematographic brands "serious" like 007 and Mission Impossible already include the comedy as an ingredient.
Humanism seems to be for children more than adults, and for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever or as focused as the soft gags of Mr. Bean's character that represent Atkinson.
The tropical premium now is that Great Britain is in serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web network and has revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground, causing the arrest of the service agent, a painfully small paper for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who is a pretentious and alleged figure, already suffering a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her the best of herself with this guy named Teresa-May, but the guide doesn't go any further.
His intelligence monitors inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of the jubilee.
And that includes poor Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but involving extra-official classes on how to become a cover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a school of spying that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his successor Bugh, a paper that is again represented by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, related to the commander of a submarie, an exciting paper, where Vicki Pepperdine is a little unprofitable.
So, Batman and Robin, when things get very light in His Majesty's secret service, they get into action once more and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletinova.
Meanwhile, the first minister is in danger of falling under the edge of the technological billionaire charisma which says he can solve the media problems of Great Britain: left-wing Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their fear of ridiculous bourgeoisies: lovers of cameras, fire a French fast-food restaurant, smell the chaos on the edge of Volta's luxury iota and English generates a great confusion by trying to use a virtual reality box to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise that they present, everything looks like a childish program.
It's pretty normal.
Like other Johnny English films, it's not helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that makes justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it's an idea of a plan because the British have a working week for four days and five minutes.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work for four weeks and cover five.
The party, of course, wants the heads of companies to experience the salvation achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers giving them a more festival day.
The employees will enjoy a three-day-week head, but they will find out the same thing.
According to sources, the idea would coincide with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to attract the country in favour of workers.
The change in a four-day work week is supported by the union union trades Union Congress as a method so that workers can benefit from economic change.
An experimental source of the Labour Party stated to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a political review was announced before the end of the year.
It won't be from night to day, but a working week of four days is a dream that comes from the perspective of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspirations jointly at present.
According to a spokesman of the Labour Party: "A working week of four days is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Prime Minister John McDonnell used the conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and "expectors" to public service companies.
The Prime Minister's plans in the shadow also include that water business shareholders may not recover the entire investment, as the laborist government could apply "deductions" to the crimes I perceived.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees in companies' associations and create property funds including to release 10% of the private sector's shares to employees, which are expected to cover annual dividends for a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and has raised the question of whether the findings of the agency could influence some senators who have refused to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be published Sunday, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring them something that would change their mind.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Speak it seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when he passed by and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
It was shown to be firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be written on fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and would file an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it round," said Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people who call it will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will host this Sunday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which brings to an end an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the week edition enguany, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Law area of Central Park not only to enjoy events like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of ending the event with extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that awaits ending poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To get a free entry for the event (as long as someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers now, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What success has the Global Citizen achieved now that he is still 12 years old to reach his goal?
The idea of premise people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case than we call "clictivism" (who thinks it marks the difference to sign an online petition or send a shot?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has stated that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its sympathies, which have helped to achieve various objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to $37,000, which would have affected the lives of over 2.250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group highlighted 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, which have already been cancelled or received at least $10,000.
The Panel estimates that the funds currently protected have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include the Foundation The Power of Nutrition, an investor and executive association with the United Kingdom, which is committed to "helping children grow as much as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a little bit of history page," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs of his website who asked, "What makes you think we can end up with extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard way, sometimes we will fall and fall.
But as the great civil rights defence movements and anti-participation, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the artists who will act at the event in New York, which will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use Marina as a "block" to block Russian energy exports (Secretary of Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary" appeal to the Marine to prevent Russian energy from attacking markets, including the Middle East, revealed by US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner mentioned.
Zinke has claimed that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where the legitimate government is operating, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they have done in Eastern Europe, the southern pan-European," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Marine, to ensure that marine life is open and, if necessary, for the blockage, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a workless group that defines itself as the "view of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he stressed that they are actually equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of using and replacing fuels," he said, while pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements reached while the Trump administration was in a mission to stimulate the export of its natural gas released in Europe, instead of Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the U.S. own president Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to come out of the North Stream 2 "inadequate" gas pipeline project, which according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "capital".
Moscow repeatedly insisted that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which amounted to $11,000 million and will double the gas pipeline capacity of 110,000 cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The US position has led to a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to split the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "think carefully" her candidate for the presidency in 2020.
The senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he said he would "think clearly" his candidate for the presidency after the mid-legislator elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider her application.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix the government's fracture, that women take care of other jobs," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously my application to the President."
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said "he was bringing the country into the wrong direction."
"I'm quite worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Friday night, Warren said, "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the elections."
However, a poll published in newspapers showed that a majority of Warren's own voters thought they shouldn't be present for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "problem" voters have said that the senator should not be present, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent of the donors supported the application.
The survey revealed a larger support for the candidate of the deval Patrick ex-govern, with 38 per cent in favour of a possible candidate and 48 per cent in opposition.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who took account of a possible candidate for 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision to the general, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin's impact on Donald Trump's mitt
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after his release on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"With what's going on my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers return with," he explained to the audience in a statement by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said to the next of his son and other war veterans, "they're a little different, they're tired, they're back wondering if there's respect for his military and pilots, like any other member of the army, they've given the country."
He was arrested last Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence to a woman, with a declaration of domestic violence and the possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police department of Vasilla.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Twenty states and the Columbia District support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence
The representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friend of guards in Washington to welcome an asylum-seekers who challenged politics, according to the NBC News.
The full name of the request for the case Grace vs Sessions that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented the August month against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his "and the children of the violent band" added it, but the North American officials rejected his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, such as countries facing generalized gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy called for a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to ask for it.
The general prosecutor of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, stated Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be assisted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend care.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants' entry damages the US economy, since it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "proportional jobs".
In June, general prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant any more victims of domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement of June 11th of this policy.
The island has never been able to solve all the problems, not even the worst, in which people face each day around the world.
Relief efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in an esprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly hopeless.
"The environment is very thin," said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma as she calmed down her son with fever at an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an amalgamation brings bones.
Lack of drinking water."
People have seen residents return to their destroyed houses to take in raindrops and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, ill with the sixth magnitude 7.5, are satisfied.
Some of the wounds, including Dwi Haris, which has broken the spa, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside because of the strong wounds they repeat.
The tears turned his eyes down as he explained how the violent earthquake struck the room of the fifth plant in the hotel where he met his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris explained to the Associated Press, and added that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The US ambassador accuses China of "produces".
A week after an official Chinese publication published an announcement of four pages in a North American journal promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed last Tuesday in China Daily's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most recent newspaper of the state of Iowa, after he accused China of joining the United States Congress on 6 November, accused China of refusing.
Trump's claim that Beijing tried to join the US elections noted what North American officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify the pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to introduce ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently working in a more intense trade war, and they have seen to it that they support the oranges in mutual imports.
In the beginning of the commercial war, the Venetian settlement of China was aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who now supported the Republical Party of Trump, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and ex-government of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, says Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote in an article of opinion at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled by advertising ads to our free press."
"In publishing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the popular North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting an announcement of payment in The Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"On the contrary, when there's a road down here in Beijing, you'll find a few discrepancy voices and you won't see any real reflection of the missing opinions that Chinese citizens may have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent journals was the offer to publish," but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans are voting for women before the mid-legislative elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warning analysts
Since many of the main republics support and defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, which is faced with various sexual assault requests, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the next mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high, and most of the Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't go away," explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said that it is doubtful that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s pressure to end a FBI investigation is enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, not tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters called "November is coming!" (November) as they appeared in the Senate hall while the republics who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of the dragon. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst independent of the news.
"People say they've already been high; it's true.
But there may have been more, especially among female voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who often don't vote while the president doesn't like them."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he described his sexual assault requests to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be produced if the Republicans were to press the confirmation.
"This has become a symbol for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the Republican National Committee, in the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote of the meeting or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh is sitting in the bank of the accused. It's also about how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose Democrats, on the news channel.
However, the North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and the Witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the balance that slowly declines to the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the surveys believe in the Ford testimony in an indefinable or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in an indefinable or probable Kavanaugh.
In addition, a 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or was incapacitated during his witness, while a 30 percent claimed for Ford himself.
After Flake's press, the FBI is currently investigating requests submitted by Ford and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had abused him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court taught him the genitals at a party while studying in Yale the decade of the 80s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data are stored and what people can access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that Inrupt's hidden intention was "dominating the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the sudden company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own personal data storage online or a POD.
It can include contact lists, list of pending tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser then.
What is excluded from the personal data store is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the delegate of the company, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills because the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some developers in template contracts to work on the project and a community of volunteers.
This week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking permission."
In a press release on Wednesday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the church of the Victoria I GM
The only church of the Church of England that won a Victory Crew during World War I as a warrior has been honored in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Governor Bernard Vann arrived on September 29, 1918 for the Bellenglish and Lehacourt attack.
However, he was beaten by a traitor four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandsons discovered a memorable moment in a disfiguring weekend in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tape was presented exactly 100 years after the baby's guarded prose.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battalion by the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick cloud and under the intense fire of cannons and meteors."
Later he ran to the fire line and, with the "Maximum Valentia" he made the line move forward before going down on a canon with one hand and leaving at least three members of the highlight.
The Colonel was shot by a German franchisor on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that the actions of his grandfather were a project that could never be equal, which makes you feel humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the fall, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the defeat and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated for the support that many people will receive.
The ghosts of the MMA who had been sleeping all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you are awake all night to see Bellator 206 and that you need to see the most important event.
The map of San José contained 13 matches, including six from the main map and had to be seen directly all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the U.S. viewers were surprised when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were shocked that the night was falling, so they were not even able to see the battle.
A Twitter follower described the change for animated drawings as "a kind of vomitious audition".
"The government's rule says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator's marketing and communication, when they asked him about retransmission.
"Shut up the bag, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were working on programming to include United Kingdom spectators in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six in the morning of a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our hour, Monday at its own.
But we're working there.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were many messages coming and coming, and not everyone was happy.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six we usually do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it ended.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but this gave him motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old exporter said he didn't admit until he went to secondary school that everyone wasn't like him.
In the program Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gas to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father would have made it more important for him to win the Olympics.
The usual representative of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off for disease.
Daley, who appeared as a nun in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" because "he wasn't socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Games of the Common World in Australia to ask more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky that he could live openly without restraint and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The world's triangular champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, North American realtor Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he took me for a surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 bigger than he, but he says that the difference of age has never been a problem.
According to him, when you're so young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age that he's experienced with the same heights and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child they named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of a brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept the fact that he had to die and that one of the last things he requested was that he already had the entries for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him," he said, "you won't be there to take care of the first row."
"As he took his hand, he stopped breathing, and it was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that it was not inevitable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to jump in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the selection of his first singing voice (Proud of Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and had yet to put on a gallon skin.
Desert Island Discs is released to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
An impeccable Mickelson presented himself to Ryder Cup Sunday
North America's Phil Mickelson will have a Sunday record in playing his 47th Ryder Cup party, but he'll have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become a happy girl.
Mickelson, who will take part in the event of a 12-time memorial, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for "forballs" and "forsomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been usually for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments spends his time doing an animator and working in his field game, hoping to correct what's wrong with him.
He never made the most direct drivers, not even at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult trajectory, where the long round is used to punish the missing times.
And if his own trajectory isn't enough dissertation, Mickelson, in the new Sunday party, will face the exact campaign of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, which has joined the Rockie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four parties this week.
If the North Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual parties, they start strong, the Mickelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, unable to tell him much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm on my back and rolled me around with his arm while he told me he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"It has a lot of confidence in itself.
It's a famous salon, and it's brought a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought more about it, but that's how I trained, and that's how we think we should move on.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of games played by Ryder Cup.
It can mean the end of a race to Ryder Cup that has not equaled its individual record.
Mickelson has gained 18 victories, 20 cuts and 7 hits, although Furyk has said that his presence has brought in the team infinity.
"It's fun, sarcastic, bromist, he likes to get out of people and he's a big company for the team," he explained.
"I think younger players are also having fun with him this week, which has been fun to see.
He's got a lot more to do with his game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that progress can be slowed down
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage of the individual duals of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The dance started in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team headed by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually they won the victory for the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"It continues to remind us that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a while," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the win of the 2018 team for 5-3 as much Friday as yesterday, leaving the marker in 10-6 to Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the team members that haven't finished yet.
Tomorrow you have to go to the whole machine.
You have to go out and do it all right.
This doesn't end until the points don't fit the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophies, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already told you, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have those who are our rivals: the world's best players."
Splendid with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never regret this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's fantastic to be with a company when it's all right, but the individual's duels prove your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to send to the players, get the best of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to do better individually than the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day's mounts, as he became part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he lost the "Miracle de Medina" he won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," she answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the head of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important parties, but we want to start with a little bit, as was seen in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure generated in these central doodles.
We've prepared alignment according to circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to launch the mount against Rory McIlroy at the main double, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all the possibilities," Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
The new German warship, again
The new brakes of the German Army should have ended in 2014 to replace the former warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the year they come from defective systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, was established until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentions a military carrier.
The ship should have joined the Armada in 2014, but later construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that the Army was responsible for in 2007 will replace the former Bramen class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-antiaeric and anti-bucco missiles, as well as technology against defensive actions, such as now a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: new bridges should be available for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the warning ships, which were expected to be able to design Germany as a powerful foreign force, will be closed when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The failed F125 was already newsed last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the castle Bloom & Voss of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once released.
There are few details of the reasons why they have returned, but German media have mentioned several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unservable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, since about 120 mariners, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen class cargoes, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is too high, which reduces the performance and limits the military's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons will weigh the double that class ships are used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has reached a surprising $3.100 million ($3.600 million) from an initial budget of €2.200 million.
The problems of the new fractures have become a matter of special importance, taking into account recent warnings indicating that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, has recognized that the Army "is staying without ships that can be used".
The officer said that the situation was temporarily interrupted because the old ships were stopped, but he didn't give up any more than I gave it back.
He's regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg's clubs couldn't join the Army.
The National Foundation Saves the Secret Life of the Ratpins
A new research carried out in a high-level earthquake in Scotland seeks to find out how the tappers use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that discoveries can provide new data on the behavior of these single flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of the scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be short-lived and common, as well as more than half-hour and water tapping in the Botanical Garden of Inverwe, located in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key property locations to monitor the activities of the tappers during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of recordings by experts will determine the frequency of raspberries and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation monitor of the Scottish National Foundation, expects the results to show which areas of habitat are more important for rats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands, and how to improve forest maintenance for tapins and other related species.
The population of orphans in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten the reefs, as they affect the noses and can cause the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a risk, such as the deadly paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, such as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the raspberries are not blind.
However, because of their hunting habits, the ears are more useful than the eyes when they have to catch a trap.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles that interfere with their will.
The Scotland National Foundation, responsible for caring for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes very seriously the scraps.
He has ten experts with the proper training, which carry out polls, kidney inspections, and sometimes routinely rescue.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to the triave State Finca, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the eighth country of the ten species of Scotland.
The Finca administrator, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Threave, we have a big area for the orphans," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all a good habit.
But we still don't know a lot of aspects of the pensioners, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow up."
Note how important it is to check whether there has been a deadline before maintenance tasks are carried out in property, as it may be that the possible indiscriminate destruction of a single motherhood killed more than 400 women and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
The hostages are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, trouble them, and destroy them.
Elizabeth Ferrell, official of the Scottish Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot of raspberries and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on its population."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a complaint against a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has stated that people "will become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will demand the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Before Portugal and Juventus were accused of rapeing a state-owned woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid at his time $375.000 because the incident wasn't made public, according to the information published Friday night by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video directed to its 142 million follow-up hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, aged 33, said they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time winner of the Gold Pilot in the camera.
"They want to make famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to become famous, but they're part of my work.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the charge against Der Spiegel for the charges, which have qualified as "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral days for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most fragile violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After he met at a night club, Ronaldo and Maorga returned to the player's room, where, unfortunately, he raped her accidentally, according to the reports recorded in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo grew up after the accident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%".
The documents support Ronaldo confirmed that both of them had sexual relations, but they were allowed.
However, he also said he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries to the hospital, but later he accepted an agreement outside the courts because he had "suppressed" and was worried about "publicly humiliated".
The woman, 34 years old, says she's trying to cancel the deal, since she's still traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo was about to hit the Royal Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer was set by the Italian giant in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will always repent" of losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always repent," if you lose the world leader status in the manufacture after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "an alarming" that the United Kingdom's Toyota Foundation had stated to the BBC that, if the United Kingdom had left the European Union without agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unconventional Brexit could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avenues of Toyota models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which about 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point of view is that, if the United Kingdom comes out of the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota Management in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has opened the doors of other United Kingdom car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider to be risks in the Brexit production chain without agreement.
The Toyota production line is implemented on a "time-to-time basis", with fish arriving every 37 minutes from United Kingdom and European Union suppliers for car manufacturing.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the European Union without agreement on 29 March, it is possible that there have been disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and loss of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day on Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it would have to stop production as a result.
Clark says that theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "scalibrated precisely to avoid these border controls".
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a total success of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long the production would cease, but in the long run, has warned that added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the Union on the farm, said that members begin to be very worried about the situation: "For experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed
The expected meeting of Donald Trump with the general prosecutor-in-chief Rod Rosenstein could "possess a week" while continuing the fight on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements of the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Russia and assistance to Trump and a possible obstacle to justice by the president.
If Trump is accused of joining the general prosecutor and risk Mueller's independence, he's been feeding the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of holding a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th floor.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Sunday he went to the White House between rumors that he was about to leave.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York, was announced by the speaker.
Trump said that "no preference" accused Rosenstein, but the meeting was held to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh, making it more likely that the Senate would vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered the following: "There hasn't been a date yet, it could be this week, although it might be a week more for all the subjects with the upper court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may reject this statement: Sanders has not been holding an information session of the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions wasn't because he didn't like the fanfaronry of television journalists, even though he said, "I won't deny they're fans."
After all, he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press should be increased.
"The president has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the next one without quoting us, "We have consulted these data."
Sanders has said that the information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better to talk to me.
We've tried to do this a lot, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open or press sessions with official visitors.
Individual press routes are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance, and, at some point, strange in front of the united journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service in fear of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the EU's exit.
The Swedish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and it seems to lead to the decisions expected this afternoon.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in the event of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it's time for all of you.
I wanted to reiterate now that I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and above all, provide valuable experience and distractions that strengthen and improve the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we are dealing with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a relic of the Tennessee State Tigers, has been subjected to an emergency operation after an injury on the weekend in the crash for 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, Tennessee.
Tennesse State trainer, Rod Reed, has reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"Come to the side line and exploded there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave oxygen to Abercrombie to the band before placing it in a letter and went to make it more trial.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, from Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that "there's still no information about the type and the extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first time of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it was set up from Illinois.
He had completed five Sundays before leaving the party, which made him a total of 18 in this period.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher price on buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher price by buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help people without paying for the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those persons who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
Hisenda expects to receive up to 120 million dollars each year to help people without food.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be graved a higher price tax by buying a property in the United Kingdom and these money will be used to help people without food, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more suitable habitats that affect higher returns.
The increase in the stamp tax will be recorded in those people and businesses who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom; these money will be directed to the government's action to combat the numbers of people without land.
The overload, which will be added to the current pressure rate, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in seconds of real estate and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenden expects to receive up to 120 million annual allowances.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are residents who are not British, as it increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially capital, have become "funtama cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes up weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the time stamp to help young people get their first country.
He accused the great structures of maintaining high prices of property buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on land eligible for repair of the Great Britain 's real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposed real estate reforms, such as now controls on the location and completion of the "no blame" designations.
He also wants to give more power to the events to build new lands.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy as it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses who are abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a land in possession is too far and the indigence of people without learning makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland trainer Jack Ross said his "maximal ambition" is the trainer of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, has accepted the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, currently occupying the third position in League One, at three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a support, and that's all," Ross said to the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up seeing much to play Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was young and it's always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in the Sunderland train station include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's extenuator claims that it is not the pressure to be the next on a list of names consecrated in such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
"From now on, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can make this team back to the First League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it is obvious that its location is the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just think I'd have succeeded here if I could make it back to the club."
Ross only has three years of experience as a trainer, after a period as a second trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months in the heart's technical body.
He helped Alooa avoid the decline in the third category and turned St. Mirren into fighting for the salvation of champion champions next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the charge to the Lord.
"I've always believed that training was the best that I've ever had, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I came out reasonably, and I enjoyed a lot of good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in such areas as stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a trainer.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've ever felt like I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is at 17:30 a.m. on a Sunday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has destroyed consumption in the bars with Britain's difficulties, but it has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bars have achieved an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA financial assistant, the company that collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sun and England's participation in the World, which has extended beyond expectations, have made July a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in June's restaurants has been imposed on July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, drinking sales increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%".
Paul Newman, of the analysts here and RSM hotel, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and impact of major social events or sports continue to be the main factors related to external market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decline in sales of a 4.8 per cent internal would be particularly damaging, rather than constant costs.
This summer so long and warm couldn't have reached a better time for the food-serving businesses and the time will say if the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide this necessary breath."
The total increase in bar sales and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, was 2.7% July, as indicated by the emphasis on branding.
The sector sales indicator The Coffer Peach Tracker for United Kingdom restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operators, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the sector's established reference point.
One out of five children have secret social networks that hide parents
One of every five children, some of the 11 years old, has secret accounts of social networks that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students showed an increase in the "insta fake" pages
Newspapers have raised fears about sex content publication
20% of students claim to have a "primary" account showing parents
One of every five children, some 11 years old, creates social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students indicated a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
Newspapers have raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
A 20% of students claim to have a net "primary" account that shows parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager who urged others to "wish me."
Research, conducted by Digital Awarenss UK and the Private School Directors Committee (HMC) of Independent Schools has revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of which are admitted to have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create spaces online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "eyes of athletes" in the Scottish athletic federation directive
Elidh Doyle has been appointed the non-executive director of the Scottish Federation's leadership at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more Scottish medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
"Eidh has respect for the Community of Scotland's Athletics, the United Kingdom and the whole world and we are sure that Scottish Athletics will benefit from their incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have many wishes to act as a voice of athletes, and I hope I can make the sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The student, who won the gold in the 200th and 400th Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympics and currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote the following to Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or how much.
It's been boring, but I've recovered from everything, I've learned to walk again and today it's about to be an agility exercise!
Thank you for the messages forever!"
An anaconda that compares mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A tirallette company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares the milky mothers with cows that are mixed.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silencer that can be taken from the world", the technology company for consumers Elvie has launched an inspired announcement in a music video of jokes to show the freedom that it gives to the mother.
Four real mothers dance in a graffiti and vacuum at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I swear to myself, but you won't see anything" and "For if you hadn't found it, they're not pregnant, but my feet."
The turnout continues: "Bomb, bomb, food for babies, bomb, bomb, murder for girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a range of reactions from those who have seen it, many of which claim to show the "horrors" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and parlored to produce beds, with the difference they are separated from their babies a few days after they are married," wrote a person.
Elvie tirall is secretly hidden in a lactating support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Frequently traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a tirade for mothers who will save their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an ad out of place."
Other people defended the announcement; one woman admitted to finding that the song was "interested."
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to give it to my mother.
Bombing for the tyrant made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as what it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun announcement for mothers who bomb with thiralets (normally in their workplace or laundry and feel like they're empty.
It's no announcement that I lie or judge the lactic industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they've all played with the tape that is discrepancies to the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like they're empty when they use the trigger.
However, Elvie's tyrant is completely silent, he has no cable or tube, and he secretly falls into a lactating supporter, making women more free to move, to subject the babies and, even, to get out while the bomber.
Ana Balarin, the first-born sociologist and developer of Mother, stated: "The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a humiliating and provocative campaign.
In dealing with the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tyrant is used and the responses that he's supposed to do, while we showed the incredible sense of freedom that the new tyrant offers.
It's not the first time Elvie's tyrant comes to the news.
During the week of London's fashion, a mother of two children appeared on the screen for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, silently moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased although monthly entry through the border has been practically stable, partly because the rhetorical and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be kidnapped.
Traditionally, most parents were immigrants without papers, who were afraid of risking their ability to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the possible parents and the rest of adults living in their countries would have to send digital stamps, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration service officer and customs control officer, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to take fewer unaccompanied.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who have taken or live in the country of a person who has been arrested are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminals.
So we'll continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new standards that require some to appear in court one month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, in accordance with refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of present, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may cause violent or attempted suicide, according to the workers and reports that have made the system known in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that due to their size, they will pass on the signs that indicate a child is suffering.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many have already suffered.
Syria urges the U.S. 'occupation forces', France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Turning to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acted as a vice-president, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the issue will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be removed immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that "the war of terror has virtually ended" in Syria, where more than 330,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displacements.
Damascus has stated that it would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we push across the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and of "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the land of a war-affected country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for exaggerating "illegally" who make refugees want to stay away.
"We have claimed to the international community and humanitarian organizations that facilitate these returns," he said.
"He's politicizing a subject that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is concluded.
The United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area at the end of the great rebellion, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political findings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with Russia's help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has clear terms and expressed the hope that military action will confront the Jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be "recorded".
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the United Nations, is waiting to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to begin to profile a post-war constitution and prepare the way to the elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task to be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the present constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump won the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections in 2020 but, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, the scandals and the destruction process have ended with its premeditated presidency.
What would be, of course, "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the maximum hearing time has doubled to 1.05 million to CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", from MSNBC, has led TV audiences per cable with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main information networks.
"People have looked at it because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, an executive producer of the ABC's "Designed Survivor" series on a cabinet director who is going to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scowell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him I'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"I answered that because they laughed at him," said Scowell.
There's a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the guide coming from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can meet together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only privileged viewers can be allowed.
And yet, being a informed citizen is going further when you're in the sixth hour to see a group of experts discussing the use that Bob Woodward made of "for private use" for his book "Do", Paul Manafort's skin jacket of 15,000 dollars ("a piece of rough clothes like his pride", titled Washington Post) and the devastating consequences of the descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, the Trump's Anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what seems to be part of a telereality program is that every night she gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars" about the changes in the characters and the program guide lines of Trump's program (to talk to NFL, play Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose any episodes because you're back.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was just outside the house he had in the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up looking at the MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't stand it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, in front of the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the face of a son.
"I remember when we made those then forgotten programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it would be a kind of joke, but it seems they were right."

External money ignores the course of the mid-legislative elections in the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is an actual amount of money in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realization of the congressional districts that made two current members have to compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of the Southern District of Pittsburgh involves the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the place in another district after some special elections last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, the republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed that the former districts were inconstitutionally divided in favour of the republics.
The 17th district course has launched a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republika campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in special elections held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but they withdraw
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners made it out of the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of state diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "relevant decisions on leaving Taiwan to be recognized", said Heather Nauert, head of the department this month.
However, only the possibility of punishing El Salvador, which received US$ 140 million in 2017, was considered to have been considered to be the only way to punish the United States for drug control, development and economic improvements, according to estimates.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be harmful to the Central American country and high death figures for murder and arrest.
In the absence of internal meetings, officials from both countries held a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar finding that continued last year and that it was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to be held, since it ended in an effective manner with any likelihood of sanctions for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the importance of administration, according to diplomats.
The three state-owned envoys made it clear that they had returned to their camps in Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions on Washington.
A spokesman from the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that the three officials described, including two diplomats, agreed to discuss internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, confirmed his statements.
History study
The next event to be produced could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible prohibition of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in the public records.
As you know, Mueller also investigated whether Trump's campaign worked with Russia in his election attack.
If the Congress changed its hands, Trump could be found accountable to the body, just when it is prepared to do so in front of the voters, and even before a party's jury.
There are many circumstances, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, neither of its European human beings, is inevitable.
There are decisions that must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a coup against Hitler, only if the western block had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munic.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history revolves around inflation such as this and speeds up, or the inexorable progress of democracy will be made.
The United States is facing various points of influence right now.
What will happen if Trump is named Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls Mueller's investigation target?
Rosenstein has been with the water in the neck since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested that the president be secretly registered and speculated that it was not appropriate for the charge.
Rosenstein says the Times information is not necessary.
"How will we answer if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court in all the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run the risk.
But I don't think we'll fail because I've learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz for the same Nazi regime that occupied the house of the ambassador.
He survived, he migrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to put on Saturday's mirrors on that table with the scaffolding.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, the best face-to-face match against Viena's Rapid.
The Rangers capture Vienna's Rapid Dijous, recognizing that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive empath in the village of Vila-real this month, would leave him in a good position to classify himself to the G group of the European League.
An injury to the knee prevented migcampist Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the period until the empath 2-2 against the Real City, but you think Rangers can use this result as a trap to get big results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the real villa is a good team," said the player, aged 31.
"We played the game believed that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have done something more at the end, but in general, the impalement was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first place, but we were better than they were in the second.
It's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought a good result to the last game, but I'm sure we'll give it all and we'll get a good result with the support of the campaign.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine and the boys enjoy it, the training's good.
I hope we can give it all, leave behind the past period and be successful."
Women lose their sound for fear of survival for the public
Although the interviewees had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few people talked to the family.
About half of the respondents at the national level claim that they have spoken to their long-term payout partner.
Only 10% of the polls say she talked to the children.
"People want some family to take care of them, but they don't dare to plant it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
We need to start by here.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can’t prepare your family for the day if you don’t talk about your wishes.
Work with your supervisor and your family to decide where and how to pay attention, since these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial assistant in the conversation: It can also help you to determine how to cover these expenses.
Your long-term funding options may include a long-term insurance policy for long-term care, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you to cover expenses or own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut your foot into legal battles.
You are looking for a representative to appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical attention and ensures that professionals make up for your wishes if you can't communicate.
It will also consider the possibility of contracting a noticeary deposit for your finances.
You have to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your old family has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?

Finance is not the only factor that has to be determined, but also what doctors are going to deal with," Martin said.

A man shot several times with a compressed air bottle in Ilfracombe
A man has received several cuts from a compressed air bottle while he was back home after he left in the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot at the foot, the abdominal and arm.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 in the morning (in the "British summer hour") as an "choice act".
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not dangerous for the wounded, and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
Since communications are limited, aid units have not been able to obtain information about Donghea's regency, a region in the north of Palu near the 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following include some important data on Palu and Donghea, in the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dondéna is a kingdom that extends more than 300 km from the coast to the north-west of the island of Celebes.
The government, a region below a province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the central Chelebes province's economy, especially in the coastal region of Donghea.
The mine explosion of snow is also important in the province, but it is concentrated, mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Dondéna have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donghea.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the western Donghea that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located at the Pacific fire station and is often produced by earthquakes with certain frequency.
The main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are listed as follows:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people at the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most popular island, causing tsunamis that destroyed the coast of the south and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 hits a pop area in the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the Isle of Mentawai, on the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters away, destroying dozens of people and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the reign of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the destruction of the earthquake and the death tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the falling buildings.
2018: A series of great earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's governor and candidate for the vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29 years old, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspects of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he got a phone call.
Palin is detained at Mat-Su's temporary detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured bond of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He compared himself to the court on Saturday, when he declared "not guilty, with certainty" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin is facing three Class A failures, which means he could go to prison for a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
It is also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in cash.
It's not the first time there's criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of adding his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is at the hands of the Alsaka Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic aggression, interference with reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a gun in the state of emergency.
His partner declared that he had given him a puny face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans to associate his son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of lands.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake has just occurred at the coast of Central Celebes, in the north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are circling at the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people met at a festival at the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, used a home Depot rental truck to end an attack on a road by the West Side Highway, at Lower Manhattan and to locate travelers and cyclists during his trip, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and that "intended" caused serious personal injuries, according to the intention of requesting the death penalty presented in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-off accusation that included eight murder charges for organized crime, which federal prosecutors used in cases of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and car destruction.
The prosecutors said that the attack called for a "relevant planning and premeditation" and described how Saipov acted as "inhuman, cruel and vengeful".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," according to the opinion.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's South District brought a death sentence to court.
The demand, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to a chain that lasted in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to end spying on the Soviet Union two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate repentance in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the statement of charges, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to end the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested ISIS's flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
It has been declared innocent of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the charges.
"We will consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, rather than accept a declaration of guilt and a continuing chain of freedoms, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party's parliament stated that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "mobilising the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
The former leader of the UKIP stated that politicians must "press the pressure of the Eurosceptics" when one of the own members of the Theresa May parliament suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bonne told the reached of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May at the time of conciliating its deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when conservatives in favor of the Union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The first minister is fighting to preserve his schedule of Chequers' compromises between Brexit's supporters, the Union's and the EU's supporters.
The alliances insist that it will reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone told the mything Leave Means Leave of Solihull that he wanted to cancel the Chequers compromise.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out already,' he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must break the Chequers commitment."
He added: "We have not fought world wars to serve them.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone disappointed the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed from mind to mind and wants to stay is completely false."
The Conservative Party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of the reporters, "I just tell you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"The commitment of Chequers is impotence between the general public, opposition will not vote in favour, it is impotence between our party and our activists, who are the people who come out of the street and get us to win elections.
Leave the Chequers commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The first ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that the politicians of the myth must feel the pressure if they want to make the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"You're trying to bring the Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, to bring the Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We're moving the popular troops of this country who gave us victory with Brexit and we won't rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Union's players made a march for Birmingham before they celebrated a two-hour match in the city center.
A small number of activists were streaming banners on the conservators against Brexit after the group was released this week.
The Conservative member of the Lords House of Lords, Lord Adonis, laughed at the conservators for the security problems they had suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for Canada's agreement more, for the free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will consider the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate to the president after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that on Sunday, Massachusetts's democracy spoke about its future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual criticism of President Donald Trump, was presented for his re-election in November against the representative of the GOP Geoff Diehl, who was an associate president of the Trimp Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It was a centre of speculation about the possibility of bringing Trump back in 2020.
The Sunday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with representatives of the open-ended meeting format since Trump took over his career.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself as a candidate to the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "the women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the bathroom."
A person arrested for murder by Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge's police, La., announced on Sunday that a suspect was arrested for the death toll of LSU Wyade Sims' basketball player Friday.
The baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at the press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for cooperation to identify the man of the metrage.
Sims, in his 20 ’ s, got shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot at his head that finally killed him," began the police officer Murphy J. Paul breakfast at the media for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and received a simpson suit.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he had been in the scene, owned by a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a young 2-m player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last period and had a mean 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebots per game.
Russia's Grand Prim: Lewis Hamilton gets the world's title after team orders deliver him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas stayed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the field position, Bottas had a good start and almost shot Hamilton as he defended his position for the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his company.
Vettel entered the boxes before and let Hamilton run with the transistor on the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop the boxes and come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after some round-up action that caused Ferrari's pilot to leave the inner part free with the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the last line of the grid and at the end of the first time he went into the week position on his 21st anniversary day.
Next, he continued in good position most of the race, since he kept his wheels in order to save time, to advance to Kimi Raikkonen, and to move to fourth position.
He finally entered the boxes again at number 44, but he could not increase the rhythm to the next eight times, and Raikkonen was placed in the fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all week and was a real gentleman who told him to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to have an u-do" said Hamilton.
Your body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein on a Sunday's interview to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of sexual abuse Brett Kavanaugh.
In a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad, cruel and lying".
"One thing that could happen and the best thing that's happening in the last days at the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, angry, cruel and lying," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the filters and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?" "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filter... no, we didn't filter it," he added while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and was filtered in September, but Feinstein refused to be filtering his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein explained to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"I asked you to be confidential, and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me."
But his rejection did not please the President, who commented on the Saturday night's discussion: "You know what? Your body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements with their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power through the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who do evil, who have to struggle to have power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two holes for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the drop of Fridays in Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the party from 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants then received a two-dollar advantage thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's finals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to the Dundee, and then two dollars from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen made his victory.
It was the third break of the season at the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to win the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three parties.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial period of aggression, Sullivan relocated the home team to the game at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equivalent at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first break when he got the second gol at night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful gorl at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen to give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the party at the end of the second party and guaranteed the victory of his team with the five goal near the end of the party.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five parties, are home to Milton Keynes and have their next Sunday party.
Aerial controller for saving hundreds of passengers on a landfill plane
An air controller in Indonesia has become a hero after his death to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers will safely land.
More than 800 people have died, and many have disappeared after a great earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many complaints in the area and there are many people trapped between the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his companions escaped to save his lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Aggung refused to leave his place at the three-year-old airport control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that Batik's flight 6321, which was at the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was in the background.
He died later at the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We set up a Balikpan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This has broken our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigating agency has reported that access to the cities of Donghea, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number of dead increases because there are still many bodies under the run and there are still many who have not been able to access," said the representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have destroyed Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and relief.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, explained to Sky News: "Every minute, an amalgamation comes through.
The potable water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been kidnapped."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
That's already a tragedy, but I could still improvise."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces: "I ask you all who work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeronautics in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident at the lake
The airline that operated a flight that was going to take place in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although it was said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that had crashed.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that there had been no passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find it.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as now its age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities reported on Sundays that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Sunday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that everyone was in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of the events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane stuck to the lake because the track was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the track on high.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he himself and other passengers were able to walk with water through the belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the volunteers had panicked and began to cry, and he suffered a stroke.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners who had been working close to improving a well also helped in the rescue with an inflexible ship to transport people affected on the ground before the plane crashed about 30 metres in the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in plane accidents recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composed a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of a man accused of smoking a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described in the jury how he used the phone records to build the 29-year-old charge movement, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sunday, Sanford refused and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, since his truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for a couple of weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they only had a week to meet.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed the text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defense is planning to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was hoping that the judge would be in the hands of the jury the same day.

Another black person?!
NY Manager asks for a couple of air-conditioning after a "racist" message
A New York manager accused a couple of a discriminatory accusation after receiving a bad text message from the mother who was protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with a "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed surprise that the new morning, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived to work the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO A NEGRA other person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
After acknowledging her pippies, a "incorded" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman admitted to Mrs. Maurice, while claiming that the manager he had admitted, that he was an African, had done his job badly, and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice complains to the couple a compensation for the acquisition and asks for a compensation of approximately $350 a day for the work in six months for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that things can't be done like this," he explained to the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the statements that they were racist all saying that Maurice's seizure was the most reasonable one, since they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you were proud of, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with a "extortion," said that her wife had been with her for two months to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like this?
It's not a very kind attitude," added the investor banker.
The legal case is still not resolved and the court of public opinion has forced the couple to report to the social networks and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors are afraid readers don't identify themselves with an os talking, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter, "It's hard to put in place someone who was bound for the first time before his publication.
Thank you very much, now we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the child book on a small pelagic bone, was optimistic about the rebirth of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agreolç", after his death last year.
Describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and he says his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not an impudent man," he said.
"But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was practically as when your son got something: you're proud of yourself, even though it's not yours.
I think he thought it was Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On his arrival, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked in order to save her life.
"Nothing often called to say that it was very sad and they didn't expect you to do it," began Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I went on a call from Nad and he told me he would die in the next two minutes and he had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll go with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications they gave her because her continuing body was consuming and getting out of her system.
He had died before he was scheduled and that's how it all went.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and more people.
I had to keep the good ways."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now sick of the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, apart from the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head cut and the tears didn't stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but while I wanted to feel a feeling of sympathy for Nad accommodating.
The feeling I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I really wanted it."
Doll women wear cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have been murdered are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been painting cards on a galley bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that citizens can call for help.
Miss Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said that his son was a boss's promise with a dirty smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could light any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a very blind spot.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know there are people to whom they can come, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said that he wasn't well or that he was depressed or anything like it," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change of attitude.
He played the background on Christmas day, when the kids opened their gifts and he didn't look at them in the eyes or anything."
He said that his death meant a great tragedy for them, but they had to work: "Open a hole in the family.
Destroy us.
But we have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is expected for a file while the FBI starts a investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for (an investigation with an area and a limited time), we could get some unit," said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed by the death penalty of the parties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican party want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to be seen right now.
If, as expected, the Republicans fail to achieve good results, they will be weakened by the fact that the person they want to choose will arrive at the country's main court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators and pressure them for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, since he was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI believes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to issue the envelope and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea deserts "cau" with Kim
The number of North Korea deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un reached power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, while citing data from the Ministry of the South Union, said 1,127 deserts occurred last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices covering human trafficking were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Usually, the vast majority of North-South deserters are offered to them by South Korea's nationality.
The sources of Seoul claim that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriated them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on the negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work in general terms to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Sunday, North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not unify ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temperature was not able to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a Sunday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have said it was a "historic," said Pelosi in relation to her reaction to the witness of Kavanaugh before the Trial Committee of the Senate.
Kavanaugh, excited, refused the allegations of having been sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very excited, sometimes screaming and leaving without words as he talked about his family and his years at the institute.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democracies and said that the charges against him were a "great and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the liberal angry people because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's witness showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court, as he had shown his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reticence when he was asked if I would try to force Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get most of the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, it's not only capable of being at the Supreme Court, but not at the court where it is now," Pelosi commented.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the Appeals Tribunal for the Circuit of the Columbia District.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings of confirmation, he raised questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be cancelled.
"It's not a moment when a historical person and with injuries enter the Court and hopes we look wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diaphragm: months and years of hunger and can't take it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a bit common.
He continued: "I was very helpful to a woman who was an executive in some place who told me that she also wept when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and began to cry, tell the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I felt brilliant."
The tears are permitted as a result of partial anger because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with most men, where I once spent crying with an unreceptive anger, is that of a bigger woman (a fresh directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me from the wheelchair and dragged me to the back of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they're gonna have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a democratic member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and was removed from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," he said while he was 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "Blancanue and the seven noses."
As he later arrived in the campaign, he went back to the background recovery, so he promised he wouldn't have access to the race if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his players, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give him 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a clue?" he asked.
When he announced his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so shocked by the emotions (gratitude by the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of getting money and being directed to voters, instead of doing it to the delegates, and anger, and sex) that he was left without words.
"I might have thought I had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press reaction.
"I might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleineex.
I remember thinking: What are they gonna do to my room?
"You'll cry?"
How trade war between the US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the US-China trade war were inseparable and, although it does not seem that the war should end soon, the countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning at the beginning of this year when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scaling took place this week, with new facilities that affect products of US$ 200,000 million, which are taxing half of all goods coming from China.
Pekin has been attacked every time in the same way and has recently raised five to ten percent of US dollars for $60,000 million.
China has committed itself to recasting the US and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy is going back closer.
Making Washington do back behaves to make a few requests, but publicly putting herself in front of the US would be too shameless for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that begin a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had foreseen," says Abigail Grace, an associate research associate in Asia-based Central for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Affairs Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country, destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moulam said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Actually, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country to which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are complex.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people who live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financed the emergency.
Europe's selection achieves victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has reached Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the North American election with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election won the crown again when the Danish captain team Thomas Björn arrived at 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the drop of water into the forest by 3, 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined all his series and turned into one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since he started the current format of the 1979 tournament.
American Jordan Spieth was separated with a 5&4 for the less qualified player of the European election Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-year-old Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, turned into the greatest winner the tournament ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't just cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It was a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad to have been able to help," began an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the ring to his compatriot John Ram, who detached the legend of North American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties that he had in France and now has a race record at Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A statistical stranger for one of the best players who ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American election fought all week to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf all the time.
North American captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European election.
He's fighting.
I'm taking the bar for Thomas.
It's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's a way to get the bar.
He's ruined us."
