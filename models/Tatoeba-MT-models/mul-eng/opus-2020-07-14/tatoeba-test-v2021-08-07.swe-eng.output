It happened a year ago.
It happened so quickly.
It happened so fast.

It's happening automatically.
We're going to have two copies of "The Rescuer in Need."
It's never snowed on the island.
It has not always been easy.
It's been snowing for two days.
It must be me.
It helps.

It's a part of the world covered with ice.
In fact, the same thing can be said in Swedish.
It's a kind of cat.
It's always dark under oil lamp.
For her, it's an offense.
It's an old script.
It is a shame that, while there are countries where people suffer from hunger, in Japan there are many homes and restaurants where plenty of food falls away.
It's a social problem.
Of course it's possible if you want to.
It's hard to keep conversation with someone who just says yes and no.
It's hard to talk publicly.
It's awfully expensive.
It's fun playing baseball.
It's gonna snow.
It's hot today.
It's Monday today.

There is no point in trying to solve this problem.
It doesn't have a string code.
It's not cheap.
It's not safe to drive without a car belt.
It's not Tom's fault.
It's pretty cold.
She's probably coming.

The clock is seven in London now.
It's calm before the storm.
It's their right to vote.
It's not sure if the letter ever came forward or not.
I'm sorry, it's true.
I'm sorry, it's true.
That's what everyone says.
It's knockin' on the door.
It's like smoking tobacco.
It's got to go.
It's gonna wait.
It'll take a few days to get in these shoes.
It looked cheap.
It looked fun.
It looks like a cat.
It looks like an anchor.
It looks like Mary's full again.
It looks like Tom wants to buy everything from the store.
It looks like you've finally decided.
That made me very happy.
The important thing is, not how a man dies, but how he lives.
It can hurt.
That meant a lot to me.
It has to be done immediately.
It must be scary.
I told you a joke.
I told you everything about Mom.
I talked about everything for Mom.
I told them to send me another car.
I told Tom he wouldn't come today.

It's probably not gonna be easy.
It was inconceivable that the baseball match was introduced.
It's been counted yesterday.
It's in Sweden.
I wrote over the car on my make.
I translated the poem as well as I could.
It really didn't affect us.
It really sucks here.
It reminded me of you.
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music is nothing if the public is dead.
I really did.
I tried to convince her.
I really doubt that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm never trying to eat after eight o'clock.
It's 99.9 percent effective.
It's a bad habit.
It's a big business.

That's all we have.
It's almost impossible.
It's a lot more than that.
It's always dark there.
It's always worth a try.
It's been coming to the station for an hour.
There's no harm that has nothing to do with it.
It's easy like a place.
It's a present to you.
It's a problem.
She's all over nine.
It's all in two.
It's Baba's voice.
It's a beautiful weather today.
It's because you don't want to be alone.
It was a moment ago.
It's been interesting.
It was so long ago.
It's been three years since we got married.

That's understandable.
It's cold.
It's cold today.
It's comfortable.
It's cool.
It's over.
It's hard.
It's hard to get a job for the occasion.
It's easier than it looks.
It's easy to forget that the microphone's in charge.
It's easy to make mistakes.
It looks like I've got an easy excuse.
It seems to take a lifetime and three days.
Everybody seems to like golf.
It looks like you taught you a lot.
It looks like you learned a lot.

That's a lot of trouble.
It's illegal to hunt giraffes.
It's important.
It's not possible.
It's in my pocket.

It's scary.
It's just a dream.
It's just a little daggy.
It's made of skin.
It's Mary's turn to drive.
It smells like someone's smoking in here.
It smells salt and algae.
It's much simpler here.
It is much more unusual for a person to be politically conscious than to be politically active.
It's much more complicated than that.
It's my brother.
It's my cd.
That's my decision.
It's my horse.
It's my job.
It's my life!
It's my way of saying thank you.
It's normal.
It's common.
I don't care.
It's not a coincidence.
It's not a crime.
It's not a game.
It's not a joke.
It's not acute.
It's not a problem.
It's no joke!
It's not over yet.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
It's not for you.
It's not for you.
It's not important!
It's not important!
It's not important what I'm named.
It's not just a pen.
It's not my choice.
This isn't my view, it's my translation!
It doesn't count, it's snowing.
There's no problem.
It's not that bad.
It's not as simple as I thought.
It's not there now.
It's not worth the trouble.
It's now or never.
Now or never.
It's okay.

That's true.
It's delicious.

It's a second hand.
It's seven o'clock.
It's still counting.
It's weird.
That's what's in here.
It's gonna be colder and snowy later today.
It started a chain reaction.
That's the best we have.
That's the second one.
That's the right decision.
It's the same.
It's time.
It's time for three.

It was long before the children found Lisa.
It took a night and an hour.
It took a month for my apology to go over.
It took me half an hour to solve this problem.
It took them two years to build the house.
I shut it down.
I said no to Tom.
Actually, it was my fault.
It was a dream.
It was a hot, gray Saturday at the end of June.
It was just a big lie.
The clock was almost 2:30 when Tom finally came home.
It was a mistake from their side.
It was a new book.
It was an unexplainable situation.
It was an internal job.
It was a pleasure to be serving you.
It was a very difficult story to write.
It was a very exciting game.

You thought the whales were fish.
It was black.
It was crazy for him to try to swim in the cold water.
It was a great weather.
It was easier to do than I thought.
She was five when I went to bed.
At first, it was a big deal.
It was hard for them to get to the island.
That was his decision.
It was his silence that made her angry.
It was impossible to find an answer.
It was impossible to find an answer.
It was just a sad gesture.
It was just the beginning.
It was bad and beautiful, but now it's starting to get cold.
It was loud.
It wasn't until yesterday that I got the news.
It wasn't a competition.
It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
It wasn't me who started it.
It wasn't necessary for him to take a paraplel.
It wasn't with the will.
It wasn't great.
It wasn't sensitive.
So sad it wasn't.
It didn't go.
It was one of my most unquenchable experiences.
It was really fun.
It was round.
It was so boring that I almost went to bed.
It was so stupid out there.
It was the window that Jack took a dog last night.
That was understandable.
It was very difficult.
It was very fun.
We did it.
That was your choice.
That was your choice.
It will take three months for our new school building to be completed.
It came to mean a lot to the city.
It'll probably snow in the morning.
It'd be nice to sleep a minute first.
It would be more difficult to close the window when it's cold.
It would be nice if I could travel to Japan.
It'd be nice if you could come.
It would have been fun.
It wouldn't play any role, though.
It wouldn't make any difference.
It wouldn't surprise me if Tom and Mary were married.
It would have been fun.
It would have been so simple.
I get it.
I understand.
