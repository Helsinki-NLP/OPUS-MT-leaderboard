White foot on f3, black foot on e6, white foot on g4, black face on h4 mt! In the square circle, it is called "dark mat".
White: snow on a1, snow on b6, king on c8. Black: snow on a7 and b7, king on a8, snow on b8. White snow is placed on a6, then only two options remain in the black: take a snow on a6 or move the snow on any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case whites move a foot from b6 to b7 and put a mate. In the second case, white snow takes a black hole to a7 with the same result.
