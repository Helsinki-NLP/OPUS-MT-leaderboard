Triumph of the legal populists in Austria, totalled 29%
A tremendous weakness of both parties of the previous major coalition and a significant strength of the right populist parties led to the first preliminary results of the parliamentary elections of the sun in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) is particularly affected by losses, where the position of former President Wilhelm Mulder is seriously on the summit.
On the contrary, the president of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is responsible for a triumphale return to the federal policy.
As a result, social democracy (SPÖ) with 29.8 per cent of the votes in the country is the strongest force in the country, compared with the last elections in 2006, but 5.5 per cent of the votes.
Even worse, the OVP is cut off, which is almost nine percent of the votes lost by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian postwar history, and especially in the people's party who wanted the proposed elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
In the beginning of July, when the OVP was released from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear precedent before the SPÖ.
The electors, however, may have punished the party for letting the government go away.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about a possible return of the party president and former Vice-President Wilhelm Molterer.
Please note that this could already be on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party's representative.
Such a development would probably lead to the most likely way out of the electoral base and thereby to a renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of both judicial and political parties - the Free (FPÖ) received 18 per cent, the BZÖE 11 per cent of the votes, but the social Democrats also expressed their fear that 1999 could continue when the People's Party spoke with the populist people (at the time of the FPÖ was still united, they had been split from the BZÖ in 2005 with regard to a common government, which had even imposed sanctions on the European Union.
It is clear that Jörg Haider, who has already explained, is ready to work with each party and depart from a return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Greens party, which suffered slight losses and broke down among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably raised the four-percent debt and therefore did not join Parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it failed to solve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India for the illegal collection of cases, it could, in the eyes of Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, bring to mind a certain recollection of the Czech-Indic relations.
This was stressed by the Minister in New York after his meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukhhardshi.
"If this doesn't clear up, then sure, then it's a certain reminder," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could only get serious.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the complaint and received a fine, the central government wanted to join the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the matter was dealt with.
"His problem could be explained," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for freedom, Mukhhardshi's view would be the best if he went to work at a higher station.
He could thus seek release on bail and wait free to his trial, so did the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was involved in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal at a higher court, then comes for him with an appeal in question," said the chief of the Czech diplomat.
The only way and how the Czech side can enter into the whole matter is to allow the judge to refer to "competenced legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in getting good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The insides give that too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, the Czech Press Agency ČTK, in front of its partner, confirmed the importance of the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he had received the offer from the Indian side to deal with the matter, which the Minister asked.
"We've already been quite promised a lot," he just said.
A check on the line around the seabed
It comes from an electronic map drawn from Australia and the surrounding sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it is the adjacent sea base.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the UN Division for Oceans and Oceans.
His head, the Director of Division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the explanation and adds it to and added it.
This is where we have a job to do and a pleasure to do.
The sea base is still a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Here, soil oil is to be found, expand iron and other non-sustainable raw materials, but also until unknown living organisms, such as the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
A seabed bigger than the country
The arrears have reported their claim to the new sea areas very seriously today.
According to a UN convention, they made use of their rights, which they joined in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
This is especially true of the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometers far from the surface of a country into the sea.
This country therefore has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continent's creation.
"Simply expressed as a continental slope is considered the part of the seabed and its salts, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the sea surface.
It exceeds the boundaries of the Ufer sea, often also the border of two hundred seams of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to establish the external limits of the continental shelf must be submitted through extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is supported by many cost-effective studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
To date, only the last three countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
At an international echo, Australia’s success was short-lived, which, as the first country, had been able to expand its maritime areas significantly.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was granted to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The gain they receive in the future from the use of the seabed will be as they promise that they will have an invaluable value.
Further countries will gradually submit their applications.
You can do this ten years from the moment they ratify the "Committee of Montego Bay".
There, where the continent’s creation ends, the area of the ocean offer, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state in here, then.
The right to promote in this area is conferred on an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold-grape country," says a transfer to Director Mikulka, adding that "each area is legally defined and the system is contractually blocked".
Pazif Chechnya
A part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East block within the common organization "Interocean Metal".
This was due to the Convention, as was the case with the investors of some other countries, the status of a so-called "trafficking investors".
The organization has the right to promote in the area ClariionClipperton in the style of the Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The Investor's research area is slightly larger than the former Chechoslovakia.
The seabed is joined there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"Others can be found on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich base of polymetallic conventions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another jurist, in the Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Division Rober Sandev brings such a convention as a pattern.
It reminds you of a small cardboard or, with some imagination, of the so-called shadow that has developed the legend after the golem for life.
German Special Forces were at the time of geese release at the site
The Egyptian government had asked for help in resolving the crisis in Germany - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they didn't get used.
The conditions of freedom of eleven European tourists in Egypt are increasingly known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the rescue action also involved German special forces.
At the same time, both German specialists and GSG 9 officials were at the airport of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Court and logistics experts of the technical assistance work at the place of release.
However, as ministers of the Montagaband continued to be informed, the German forces were not required, as the geesemen had let their prisoners run and fled when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to connect it as a support force in place.
"This is not the case," said a spokesman of the Federal Ministry.
The attackers had led the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After the exodus in a desert area in southern Egypt, the geese in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were removed and relocated.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear to the end as well as the details of the release or possible settlement payments.
The rescuers arrived in Cairo between well-being.
Steinmeier said the free spirits were in the ombuds of the German message.
For the details of the release, he did not express himself.
In Berlin, there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
The five passengers and the special forces are scheduled to be deployed with an airbus of the aircraft and to meet on Tuesday in Germany.
U.S. Representative's house is leaving rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has made the 700 billion hard-earned rescue package for the financial markets very easy to break.
The Dow Jones broke into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all calls by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians both parties, there was no majority for the programme that should be included in the Chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents have tried to convince critics yet to convince themselves of the $700 billion heavy packages.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiating leaders, had called on the members to vote, even though the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that's not yet in place," he said.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones brought more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was the concern of the prosecutor that the State rescue package could be resolved.
Shortly before the end of the vote, he withdrew, after his announcement, to resign.
Experts are now counting on the international financial markets with more serious turbulence.
For an entry into force of the programme, approval is required both for the House of Lords and for the Senate.
Publishers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel planners:
During travel bookings for the coming months, the turnover has increased significantly by more than 30 per cent for the winter season compared to the previous year.
Despite weak conjunctural views, the loss of Germans of a study remains undisputed.
In the winter season bookings, the travel offices recorded a turnover of 31 per cent compared to the previous year's period, as reported by the German travel association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
The investigation of the GfK market research institute also shows the booking numbers already increased for the Herbstmonate.
Thus, the sales volume of the travel offices for October amounted to around 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRW shared.
Based on these results, GfK’s monthly booking data are estimated by 1200 German travel offices and increased for the overall market.
This includes the travel books completed by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar course, special travel was requested in the United States, the DRW shared with.
This is where the booking growth takes place around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic territories of Germany, were particularly asked for travel goals.
In particular, during the course, Drv-President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the increasing cost of energy and food, the cost of "costing for customers is better calculated than the individual organised holiday".
Money may be saved by consumers, including morningbook discounts or all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that by the year before the year, there will be a resale plus - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who took up a trip will fall short compared to the previous year.
My First October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the finals, beer from liter circles and promises in designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn-Dubt.
Susanne and I don't really have much together.
She's a blonde, television moderator and wears a moderated dindl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is a second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: almost three minutes on the Wiesen, the photographers are already staring at us and cutting the memory cards completely - very funny and that at my first visit to Wiesen.
That's how you make friends.
The Billig-Dirndl seems to fulfill his purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the white-wavequator, the feeling of well-being remained in the track until that day.
But only once on the horizon, everything is so bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or Lederhosn; no shoes hurt or hurt - everything is completely normal.
Even the sights at the Schokobanen station are only getting my hands on my back.
A münchner reminds me that I had made the jokes false: "Links hot free, middle young woman, forgive right, pushed back."
At home, I'm getting rid of my shoes from behind to the left.
"Pass", say it and laugh.
Others make less excitement about subtle flickering techniques and wear silhouettes on which "To drink to get dressed!" and stretch an unsatisfied part of the naked interior.
The young man with the exhibitionist Attitudin is named Bob, comes from England, and visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long-distance "oooooo".
That's what he tells me after he cleaned up his previous drink.
Right next to one of these hydrants, from whom everyone thinks he's a mollusc.
So Bob's one of this famous "Wildbyesler".
Others do not have the happiness to drink in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, Healthiers run around the place to care for the poor lockers.
The patients are always on the wheel - always four on one side of an overcrowded thread of cell to cell.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
Whoever's in the Promille-Sarg under the plan, you don't see.
"These are the ones that pack the tires," one of the healthists called me to ask and disappeared in the grave.
Name of the accident victim known by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female female nurse who died in the hospital after being driven to Essex by a vehicle was known.
Carol Paulson, who lives in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of his suspicion of light driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey's attempt to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in moving deeply into Turkey's country.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this broken, casseric effort.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance Style.
That's at least what the tour guide tells you.
The building is situated at the end of the road with a tower on each corner of the front and looks like any provincial German Rathau.
The stone is drunk.
The whole building is about to collapse
But if one is within the trained driver's license plate, there is no doubt about the existence of the project, whose most recent access was this.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German Consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late player in the imperialist game, had before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany gained imperialist ambitions during the first world war.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence from Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the inviolable borders of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway Court.
In 1917 a munitions flow into the air, where the artificial roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen, largely past history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a tower for Anatolias and especially east of it to promote the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a voluntary new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
A policy of approach now prevails.
Noteworthyly, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the exact data of this new foreign policy, I spent the night in the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Suat Kinniklioglu of the Turkish team.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a half-hour drive to churches that produced the same pace of the old world in the famous "The Night Mail" document, I came to Turkey's capital, which is considered a new city for the new world state projects that the Osman's past brings back.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has solved some of the mysteries in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main business of the AKP, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developed city, surrounded by half-made shopping centers and buttons in which middle managers, both men and women, meet to conclude the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Come on, Krawatt, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The cold war was an exception," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its continent.
Today, they have to look to the east and west at the same time.
It doesn't go either one or the other.
You've got to do both.
"But I'm sure the Turkey could ever be," I asked, "were you forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then made a point, which almost everyone I spoke to here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, as the message seems to be, Europe can travel as a whole along the coast of East Asia and the Middle East as a whole.
Back at Hydar Pashas Train Station, after a very long sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen this construction work 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be too much in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the railway station, which should bring me back over the bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the same time, there seems to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In the mind of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonics and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus in the following year.
He was thought of as young as 21 years of age, but when the choir was the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological exchanger) was for the availability and ability of the choir, any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a medal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young Chores was often amazing, always exciting and was unique and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never lasted for years.
How often did we die to "let the music speak for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
It's so loud!"
Its kind of direction was absolutely clear and precise, but never
As always the musical level was high, he always demanded a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any director had been shot at the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonics.
In the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
Tod Handley was the rare combination of size and personal information.
He condemned the rulers who, according to his words, simply "had been housed with one or two famous sheep animals in the world."
So many of us will lose him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your address for William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), you write that "the teaching of economic history in Oxford took place again in 1946 and in 1950 a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... while studying for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate at the same time.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruffs Book "Jenseiits von Nab End", however, it does not agree.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British Kautschukin Industry, under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published as the "British Kautschukindustry".
He was in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 on the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to replace this part of his driveway.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological College.
I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in document style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their shame and the power they express, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of the outstanding sale at Honda.
In November, Honda started marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its previous model had a large inner space, these large-space limos still provide a significant increase.
This will also enable the technical features that can save even faster vehicles and petrol.
Changes before the previous revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in these large limos are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be highlighted.
However, before starting to analyse the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
Following the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, was able to renew this model for a short time.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, a million models were sold alone in Japan.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates were 10,000 cars, which are 17% of the growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz Models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales in Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the directors of the branch in Spain expect to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
In particular, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to translate the sales discount into Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the market hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. These are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by 1.8% over the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this proportion, Honda sets out a new model.
It is about Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models per year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the view on the market is foreseen for the first month of the year, for the first time its public presentation will be held in Valencia in January.
In view of the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 cm ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 cm) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has increased by 5 centimetres.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1,52 meters.
Along with increasing the dimensions, the inner space will also be expanded.
This success is, on the one hand, the new space flexibility programme and on the other, the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in Jazz's previous model.
Also the capacity of the buffer space, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 litres, so 19 litres greater than the capacity of the buffer space of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1,4 litre gas engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz buffer space is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, other than the additional equipment items such as leather seats or the possibility of panoramic windows, improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the interiors is 80 degrees, where the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of his marketing, this small model 2 performances of petrol engines: 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and at the same time has a driving force for the entire engine.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6,000 drawings with a maximum speed of 114 nm at 4 900 min.1 .
This petrol engine - the previous model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5,3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 output of 125 grams.
In view of the previous engine, which reached 83 PS at the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 output.
'Auto-Bine', avoiding collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for disaster prevention, Nissan was once inspired by nature, specifically by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight to the winter behaviour of bees and prevents accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for disaster prevention.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the leader of technology-PR and R&D-Brand management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-legged Nissan security shield.
This robot should ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own, evaluative plane, which is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
But most important are the facet increases of the bees that can see across a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which enables them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To develop the roundup perspectives, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that occur at the BR23C distance up to two meters and is located in the 180 degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a border microprocessor that is transmitted directly in signal for the prevention of collision
} At the moment when the obstacle is detected, the small robot will imitate the beneficence and change the direction immediately by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid collision.
The largest difference in other systems is that this exchanger is absolutely instinctive.
If it wasn't so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot either go up or down, but not across; he can only move to two dimensions and to the direction that enables him to rotate his wheels and not into the infinite directions and in an infinite way, as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and decommissioning functions to prevent the small robot from colliding.
`This device needs only a few seconds to process the information and to act on this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the abovementioned manoeuvres, so it can continue to work with just a few thousand KB of the storage site.
This sounds amazing, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in developing technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to introduce Nissan in the next ten years at the serialnautos.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than the multitude of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellites to lead to the goal and avoid obstacles on the way.
She's on her seat before she's charged with a mortgage.
It must be noted that the US Ministry of Finance has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but is not without a message.
Before the crisis and to avoid the development of US citizens in mortgage stories of the alleged paying banks, a sustainable and informative game was developed for the Internet source: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credit' or the difference.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its recipeist is to think about one, two and three times if it is the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She must have useful information, but without details.
This is more than a page for the teenagers than a place for all visitors.
What happens when the game is extended?
Now, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something because it's not going to buy a better house
Morgan Stanley makes her capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the introduction of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to her company, where this was the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and take over 21% of its capital, a renewal that will be carried back to a strong case of her pregnancy.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MMFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stamps will be purchased at a single price of $25.25, which represents a total of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the price of the share as of 31 August.
MMFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will ensure a 10% profit and can be resaled at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be implemented on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, thus 28 % above the current rate.
The Morgan Stanley Act, however, fell against 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," John Mack, director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business in new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more predictable position than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed during the last days: last Monday Morgan had failed to make it clear that they would sell up to 20% of their shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'For a week', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, we thought that the participation would be entirely from stamps.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure us.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares of 7% under its short value.
And the business will be allowed to decrease the profit by around 20% per share.
The agreement suggests that in one year, MMFG will be able to convert half of its preliminary actions into stamps if the latter are spent more than 50% over the value of the sale within a given period, thus at least 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the money provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities to strengthen their balance and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker in the group refused to make more specific comments on the strategic objectives of the two new associations.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to sell a payment capacity of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance since the end of August has been 'public'.
The last weeks were hard for the group that had to look at how she returned half of her salary, while the price for insurance against payment capacity was fast in the height.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only "overlived" of the big investment banks at the Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, to have taken part in Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this morning in Quito.
The Republic once again builds on the socialism of the 21st century.
This is how the joint ventures of the Venezuelans Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa are conducted.
The third was the one that followed this Sunday, the example of his peers and friends, the plan of a new constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because, according to 80% of the voter votes, the public results of the referendum voted 64% with `Yes'.
As a result, 28% agreed with `No', 7% of the list of options were invalid and 0.7% were given empty.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, a vote must be taken more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two questions were conducted at the polls of the elections and a statement of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for `Yes' and 63% to 70% propheticly.
In the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa asked for the victory of his constitutional project.
In Guayaquil, the "consisting has triumphed in a overwhelming way," he had secured the seat of the government 280 kilometers south-west of Quito, and freeed the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Corree of Chávez and Morales was happy, but also by his Chilean equivalent Michele Bachelet.
The choice, which was held in silence under the observation table of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on an existing text of 444 points to ensure the 'new socialism' used by the President.
The draft Constitution confers on the economy the exclusive right to 'development plan' in a country, which is largely based on the promotion of land by foreign companies and the loans sent to the country by immigrants.
The project, which will be preceded by the 2006 Chore, will also have a more comprehensive power for the Head of State to be able to implement up to two consecutive mandates from every four years, and will have the opportunity to resolve the national assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will pursue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education that the President has already begun to implement in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also proposes to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which is prepared to end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian support point as the starting point for American antiretrovirals.
The 19 Geselles were set free in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the leader of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were arrested ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who had been imprisoned in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Sunday afternoon.
In the morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Tschad.
Apparently in good condition, the geyselles reached the al-Maza military support point at 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft directly near the international airport of Cairo.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter in the hospital of Maadi, an alien district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They are pleased with all 'best health' and the drivers 'are not paid for money', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the role field.
After they were arrested on 19 September at a land-car Safari on the foot of the Ouanat Mountains in the border area of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, the group of geese was always brought back by 35 unknown drivers from a hideout.
It is about eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian Agency, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, had launched the attack at night, shortly before the dawning of the morning.
'On both sides the arrows and half of the driver were killed, the rest of the flights,' said this responsible man who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian teams.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he was right about the role of the secretaries and elements of the Italian specialities.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units," he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom was paid.
On the morning, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle at a patrol, in which the drivers found themselves, of which they six, including the drivers from the Chad, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the movement of libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately conflicts with this movement.
Letter - The stable majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture leads to cuts and is a central theme of the current election struggle.
So it's better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in ignorance.
Who will rise and start the warm sums that will be given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are falsely burned?
What politicians are going to be able to remind the Federal Government that they trust their monuments and their culturally important constructions?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, which effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government will make EUR 3.5 million only and only for the restoration of the closing of Chinon in Loiretal?
Our American neighbours are writing in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the American culture, and that this culture must be protected by all citizens, all officials and all government districts, and that it must be protected by mutual consent.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical companies Quebecs, at least 40,000 honor officials gathered in 211 historical companies are striving to be intensely involved with history, to save the many private archives with a few Greeks, and to receive the archaeological remnants.
They are also often the wakes of our culture, which protest with the power of doubt, when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten moments of peace.
When will there be a stage for history and culture?
Benelux government parts of the Fortis Bank
In part, the Benelux states of the Belgian and Dutch Fortis Bank, which was hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence, want to be caught under the arm: the three states are the bank and insurance institution, which is also located in Hungary, totalling EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition authorities.
In the euro area, fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been held for a year, and therefore decisions that may have been taken in connection with the bank can have a pre-trial character.
In the light of the decision taken on Sunday, all three countries purchase the respective shares of the bank by about 49 per cent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its shares, all of which have been purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro insurance activities last year.
The shares of the Fortis have started a tough talfaht last week, and in the second half of the week there are already serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too big with its 85,000 employees for a plot.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% on Friday on a 14-year-old basis.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen to more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rate, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which is said to be unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion is valuable American rescue package and the uncertainty caused by it on the markets is due to the wage of the Fortis actions.
On Monday, however, the courses were slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The credit institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in a professional offer.
The Belgian government was trying to settle down - no one should sit around his money, he said.
There has been no panic among the customers, the branches of the bank have not been broken.
In Hungary the Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls its own Leasing companies.
Top to Bottom, Right to Left
Because of the drug consumption of a person, in America life insurance and sickness often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts feared that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that relate to the use of medicinal data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the footman" - quoted by Washington Post Richard Dick, the developer of the program for the follow-up of description data.
Insurance shall determine the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage, depending on the customer's health, and the risk should be assessed too high, the insurance will not be closed.
The customer was previously sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick found a much more valuable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last half years from the apothecaries, which were purchased, and the program calculates what the customer's disease is and how it is healthy.
For example, if he regularly buys a large amount of cholesterol, it would lead to his blood fat count untreated, which would automatically select him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the process - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurance must only result more in the paper framework, however, there are smaller difficulties.
One is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraine and hypertension, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurance undertaking, while the latter are not mentioned.
For the question and processing of the data, companies have formed themselves, which, before they relate to the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although no exemption has been granted.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them with the data on the drug consumption, thereby providing a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
There is, however, a private data protection law for health data, but its effect is limited to healthcare providers and insurance.
The legislative draft has already been presented to the Congress, in which the authorities can also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard points out that this is too small, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can be submitted only with the understanding of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may not have access to his data, since the assurances do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And that's how the hives are just left out in any of the favor of the foot.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India duplicate trade
Since the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at nine summits.
Today, too, the French-indigenous summit is taking place, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an ambitious, democratic power that should be given more voices and the right to speak in international cases, it is still not possible for Member States to agree whether they should support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed last night in March when the nine-year-old summits in Marseille were held.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received an agreement with the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Given the fact that the ware exchange between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even as ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing Civil Aviation Agreements with India were legally incorporated into an agreement so that future air transport will also be evacuated.
By 2009, India wanted to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the package.
The objective is to create a balance in the current uneven relationship between the EU and India: while the Union of the partner number is an Indian, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to the global events.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in relation to terrorism, which was condemned on both sides of the ship. The introduction of a UN conference was also called for.
The Doha rounds should also be closed, where both sides are liable to wear.
The EU stressed that it was included in its energy and climate programme, which meant that waste emissions would be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
In this way, India also agreed, as well as with the proposal, to conclude a global compromise in the coming climate and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be fought, and both support the introduction of an international conference on the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Head of Government is visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris it is hoped that contracts with French companies will be worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the Agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian employees in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian consignor at the International Frankfurter Buchmesse.
More than 300 Italian lawyers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for lawmaking.
The International Frankfurt Book Messe awaits the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square metres of the exhibition and represent over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honoredest event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Culture and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be present at 264 km of the large exhibition room "Punto Italy".
A press conference near the room structure will follow in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book month: at this point, figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the exhibition hall in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers in general, especially in the adult and youth parties, is taken into account.
The missing little plane of the billionaire Steve Fossset a year ago
The small aircraft from Steve Fossett, which was discovered on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the west of Nevada, was discovered.
The individual parts have been found on a high platform of 3000 m high in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the Federal States of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human surpluses within the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully confirmed the last doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been located and a troops have been sent. Now we have the security that it's about the plane with which Steve Fosset is flying the day of his departure."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the aircraft.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared in February.
The U.S. Department of Transport Safety (Ntsb) announced that a man had been sent a few hours after the aircraft was found, which identified the machine: it was about the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fosset in Yerington, Nevada, started a three-hour flight.
Finally, yesterday in California, near the border to Nevada, some of the personal items of Fosset were found from a couple near their house at the Mammoth Lakes.
There are two references to the name Fossets, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, Bar money and a Jack.
The search for Fosset was completed a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, it hit him at the sixth stage, when the first man hit the world ball in a Heiss air balloon: a two-week, single flight.
Three years later he flew around the world in a single flight without interfering with a plane.
Among its various records, a 15445 m altitude is also above the wind, however, with a co-pilot.
Look, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that comes through its original design and the special line management, the unloading surface and its clear angle from the usual schemata.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offerer to attract the sector's new atoms.
Thanks to its extraordinary properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also disappear unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
The advertising trolley, accompanied by the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, i.e. in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in southern Italy.
A project with a high-level fund to be implemented at various stages, which will be adopted by the central shopping mile of Milan, will be carried out by Corso Como until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como, which should provide a special perspective: the new suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear out of the plate on which it is painted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology of the new glk at different times in all its details, it will be clarified to reassemble it as a whole.
No doubt it is the case of Mercedes with this publication to introduce a new type of auto advertising in this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interests of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, who are now ashamed of all of Italy? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been traveling back to Italy for years and that, honestly, has not yet caused serious problems.
Never came to encounter with opposing fans before.
The origin of the group is in the right millieu.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, there were even smaller groups from campaigns and Apollos.
They carry the tricolor, which appears to the cities of the military: but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria it now came into contact with a truly radical fan of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans 144 cards were available for the game: all were displayed on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, there was no one with a running stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian mansion, which had already been imposed in this regard, were also denied the ticket and travel to Bulgaria.
The Viminal is now waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case the arrested or identified typhosis can be calculated with a stadium ban for at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is, of course, fear of neighbours who could follow them less than 150.
"This brand has to be expressed around, and this behavior does not give the opportunity to justify it," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "Look at, above all, with a view to the game of the National Mission on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in April there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
In the morning, the Osservatorio (Sportview) will be gathered, the Casms on Tuesday, which can be counted on part of the Asia, so the secret services that deal with the problem of the stadium government.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the acquired right arm during the Hymme of Mammel? In Bulgaria this is no crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in joy) who has been the director of the Osservatario on the Viminal for a few weeks (to take over the posts of Francisco Tagliente and to Felice Ferrizzi).
In the past, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the 2002 ultrasounded Italy arrived.
However, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to celebrate the Duce, but it is doubtful that the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – add paragraph 1 of the Osservatory – crimes will be committed in their country of action.
Until then, this group had been in the garden, but now it has to be overemphasized what happened and it will happen.
But we're also talking about the pimps during the Hymne Mamelis: this is also not a crime, but they allow me, because the education is missing..."
