In total 174 beneficiaries were tested positive on the Corona Order Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Landassamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday afternoon.

In the business, it is a large gymnasium, built on the earth’s gardens, churches, coal and red beds - but only for litigators.

This is similar to the SPD: "We have already called for a special control program for farmers with Erttefern after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schwarthof mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The health conditions at the workplace and living conditions must be closely monitored from our point of view.
This is obviously not happening."
The explosion had come "with orders."

Søder is exposed to a mass infection at the Corona site
München - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a substantial increase in the production volume.
The press conference will be on our website alive.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau District has been resolved by the authorities and politics.
At the large community building, almost 500 farmers from several countries are currently working, and over a third have been infected with the Corona hierarchy.
The court is in the middle of the Quarantine and is closed with a building.

"Beautiful": the state of the tummatic firefighter of Nantes
"My mandate has been cooperative," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets very much the deeds, the state was a release for him."
His mission was "delegated by consciousness and very involved in the extent of destruction".
In the case of a judgment, the man was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and a fine of up to 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged on the night of Saturday last week at a fire.
The fire broke out in three separate places in the church.
Labour research generated the suspicion of fireflies.
The suspects who were now arrested had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But one day he was released again.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible at the front of the fire for closing the cathedral.
Since there was no trace of a violent change in the church, he quickly entered the scene of the Founder.
Discussion of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President, Reinhard Grindel, recommended to consider the repeal of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said the main part of the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can be dangerous in the first Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work without: see Leipzig or Liverkusen.
Otherwise, the debate is not about whether it is not proposed that associations that want to break into this Phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors."
However, he has doubts whether it is available in the German Football League to allow majority participations which are under ban in the Federal Republic by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of attracting investment in a European single market to the German economy," Grindel said.
The former DFB head sees the danger that "the attempt to ensure a more competitive balance in the Federal League will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to further tension in the master's community".
Even an equal distribution of TV cameras will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern employs a turnover of 750 million euros, Borisia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are unique among the first three sets already.
The other 15 units have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking back on the past, it feels like it's crazy.
"I am sorry to have given people who have noticed this error and have made it to the press instead of me," Grindel said about the adoption of a precious hour that had led to his return in April 2019.
"That's done me very well."
The gift in the value of around 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian operative.
"I've started a compliance test, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"With the minimum hour gift, I've been completely transparent and angry.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He's never "made a hero out of the gift," he's in the 58s.
"This may be called naiv, however, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects the offer of believers
The new requirements could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs shared with Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," he said.
"While 50 percent of the children live in Argentina in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our fellow believers."
The debts of the second largest people's economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to abandon some of their claims of approximately US$66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If it comes to no agreement, the country will redraw the state place.
It would be the ninth payout in Argentina's history.
Finally, the creditors had asked for higher interest in state loans and changes in certain contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is determined on its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is facing a serious financial and economic crisis.
The rate of inflation last accounted for more than 50 percent.
For the last year, experts estimate a decline in economic power by around 10 percent.
By the end of May Argentina had failed to meet interest challenges of 503 million US dollars, and this resulted in a limited payout.
Professional arrival - not yet private
"It runs great" - this phase, Dr. Stefanie Kramer says after her first days in the Notariate in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very fast: In mid May Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will be present in the Eggenfelden Notarial Place as the successor of Lutz Feller.
Six weeks later, in the beginning of July, the promoted jurist took over the work, the normal day-to-day business ran long on full tour.
"I still have to come, however," she explains in a conversation with the Rottler publisher and laughs.
Of course, the short term has not been enough to completely reduce the food point of Regensburg to Eggenfeld, reports the bourgeois dingolfingerin.
Now, whether she and her husband, who is in Regensburg as a judge at the Land Court, are looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least your husband has been able to apply for a short parental period to ensure the care of the two daughters (311⁄2 and 111⁄2 years old).
In order not to get out of Regensburg every day, they also have an evening opportunity with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-olds.
Raised in the neighboring region, she is, of course, the city of Eggenfelden for a long time.
When visiting a place with her family in the past few months, she decided again: "Marriage is a beautiful little town."
She was therefore more pleased that she had done the race in the selection process for the free position.
Also in Dr. Stephanie Kramer's professional career, her home at the Netherlands plays a central role: after the Jura studio in Pasau, she finished her reference period and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations such as Notarassessorin, including in Reuhau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Underground and Regensburg - at this time she also earned the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she took up her first place as notary in Rottthalmünster in the landscape.
In 2016 she went to the parentheses, which finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken representation services in various notaries.
If the positions in Eggenfeld have been written because of the approaching peace of Lutz Feller, they have seen the right time for the full professional return, explains the 39-years.
The team of her predecessors, who will take up the vacation in the Notary, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has also made a song for the Chancellor's crew: "It's doing great!"
The fact that she can leave here on a playful walk makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming release of the private food point.
In matters of children's gardens, they already have contact with a local establishment.
And hits everything as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her Hobby here as soon as possible - and to get to know the beautiful Jogging Streets of the Rottle.
BVB plans to start Liga with a maximum of 15,000 visitors
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be filled at the start of the season in the case of a fan return by 20 per cent.

At the BVB for marketing, digitalization and internationalisation, Cramer hopes that in addition to the normal sighting sites, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospital area can be opened: "Of course, it is a hit in the office if these admissions are completely broken".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone will now be "well advised to enter a stable page length".
"If many companies don't go well and 6.8 million people are alone in Germany in short-term work, then the need for maintenance is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB profile for its performance profile, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their performance has a different effect than if we are 100 people working in Merchandising on short work".

"Even if they don't, of course, cry as loud as big babies."

The idea of the implementation format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar rejoices about the scope of the teaching.
Even if all participants were pleased at the conclusion that the direct encounter in the theater and stage room would still offer additional trips, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the game business," stressed Director Winfried Tobias.

The film was in Germany under the title "Motherheart".
Three years later the award came as the best actor in William Wylers "The Heress" (The Erbin).
Many recognitions have also been given as neurotic excentrikerin in "The Dark Spigel" and "The Slingrupe".
Daphne du Maurier presented her in 1952 for the main role in filming her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece has been a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenly for a Body".
From the marriage with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son of Benjamin went ahead.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Giselle with him.
And this marriage ended.
The charges against an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.

Kalbitz draft confirmed from AfD - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "feeblat" from the view of the FDP and does not change anything in the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the law-extreme in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the Eisberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP-intensive politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, the Federal Court of Justice of the AfD confirmed the conclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the Federal Bureau in May on a majority basis.
Kalbitz is president of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Landday.
"If the AfD were really going to remove legal extremists consecutively from its party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his allies would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD, because legal extremism is still a party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Bloome said: "The Andreas Kalbitz is now shut down, says nothing and does nothing change," he said the "World on Sunday."
"There are many ties, as many French supporters speak of a legal extremism in the past in the AfD."
Flowers suggest that the AfD will be re-entered in the future by under five per cent.
"The days of the AfD in Parliament have been numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the official "flying" between the officially dissolved "flying" around the Thuringer of the AfD-Landes and Group-Höcke; the Constitution protects the flow as "secured right-extremistion".
In May, the AfD Board of Directors had withdrawn Kalbitz from the party.
On the basis of this, Kalbitz did not present an earlier membership at his party's entry into office between the prohibited "Heimatreuen German Youth" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz is the member of the HDJ.
Similarly, the president of the left-wing group in Brandenburg's Landburg Day, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the Federal Court's decision did not change anything in the case of the AfD: "The Wolf has only released credits.
The AfD remains a right-wing party whether or not with or without a calbitz".
Neither will the Federal Party fail to comply with this decision.
"The mannover of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
One wants further observation by the constitutional protection and attempts to pass under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD is not the spirit that she invokes.
A draft resolution does not change yet," commented Mr. Erik Stonen, General Secretary-General of the Brandenburg SPD, in the case of Kalbitz.
"He has held the AfD-Landes Association and the Group to this day to their right leader."
The legal representation on the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now be civilised against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
Nordsee-Windparks deliver good 21% more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 terawattt hours of electricity was stored on the German North Sea.
This is 21 per cent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator shared tennis in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea Streams to the Festland and the forwarding through the German Streamnet.
The wind systems on the east, which do not belong to the Tennet network area, have recorded additional 2,22 terawattt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind current from north-east and east will reach 13.73 TWh, compared to good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The winders on the sea thus make up almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New windparks provide for higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is based on higher production capacity ratios, as new windparks have gone online in the past 12 months.
If the 1270 windpowers in the North Sea were to run all at the same time with full force, they could generate a linear 6.7 Gigawatt power.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is said to be tenet at 7.1 Gigawatt.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 Gigawatts in the north of Germany.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the development of offshore network connections," said Tennet-Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality windparks can also not lose their capacity at sea, but they reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day in this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea-Wind Parks produced more than six Gigawatt electricity.
In the middle the North Sea windows produce about 2.5 to 3.0 Giwagatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
Almost seven million households with electricity could be provided.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by Leipzig's artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small Christmas party at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstvereins: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works of Leipzig's artist Christian Bold broke the usual frame after the Corona break.
A lot more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the president of the art company, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical Equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern corner.
North of the gallery was engaged by the "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has celebrated the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have indeed not made this decision easy for us, and - in a sense, how difficult it is for those who are involved in the economic situation - until the last minute," said Oberburgermeister Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But in the end, we are responsible here for the health of thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands of people had been displaced in the country and in the castle, minimum levels, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be maintained in accordance with the current Corona protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not be much left by a people's party.
In addition, the need for organization and monitoring would increase disproportionately throughout the course of a multiphase.
Rumberg died next year.
Then the city celebrates its 100-year-old existence, including the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the date of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Do not hit Dressur-Olympiager Value in Acelates
Akleiten - The six-year Olympic Olympics Isabelll Werth was the most amazing traveler on the Dressur tournament in the Austrian Akleiten.
The 51-year-olds from Rheinberg came to four in the weekend at four starts.
After she had won a great prize every Sunday at the Grand Prix Special and in the Church, she was not to be beat.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihgoold, Wehgold placed his head on the side of the Abeglen on Sunday, especially against the Austrian leader Victoria Max.
In the church, the Germans also made it clear on the Saturday at Quantaz 34 years ago that Victoria Max-Theurer was an old student.
Werths Siegerpferd Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dreamer is to establish the ten-year Hengst at the Grand Prix.
For Quanta, it was the first bullet ever.
In the first tournament in Akleeten three weeks ago, the value of all four important tests had been won.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14 to 16 August.
Future more flights in Worms
The Wormser University continues to run: The "DFS Deutsche Aviation Guarantee" is a professor of Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The Treaty was first concluded for three years and began in 2021.
The professor has the possibility not only to allow the study to begin in summer, but also to the winter master.
So many students can be trained twice as much as before.
At the same time, both in the university and in the DFS aviation academy are equally charged.
The DFS will be consulted at the University of Applied Sciences.
Since 2019 I have been at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training to fly to the University of Worms are at the study on Air Traffic Management.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and loten training contributes to increasing the attractiveness of the lottery.
"In these times the promotion is not easy.
We do, however, expect that the transport will recover and grow again for a long time.
In order to be able to carry out our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Managing Director of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's professor is a secure investment in the future, which will provide the flights with a broad, well-known knowledge base for the long term.
We therefore continue to work well together with the university and at the same time tolerate our attractiveness as workers."
This also highlights Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, president of the University of Worms: "The foundation professor creates an important bridge between science and economy.
With it we would like to join the existing cooperation with the German Air Traffic Management DFS as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor Study Air Traffic Management."
The confidence of the German Aviation Guarantee will be at the same time as the Warms School's motivation and obligation to further develop its teaching and research skills in the future fields of air transport.
In the use of the flights tomorrow, the university, with the first foundation professor for a double course, could place very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, further education and culture, stressed: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in the air transport sector in the Rhineland-Pfalz.
Today's signing of the Cooperation Agreement strengthens the profile of the University".
A 45 Land of Rescue Supplies
For about 30 minutes, the bus A 45 was completely closed on Saturday at Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic accident the rescue driver was using.
A 76-year-old was just outside of Alzenau-Mette in the curve and landed on the lead plane with a Ford against 12.40 hours.
Through the fire, the front bag was released, the driver experienced slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital.
The injuries of the 72-year-old beifahrerin were provided by the Notarzt and the patients fled to a hospital in conjunction with the rescue surgeon.
But now the police are saying there's no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, at which a damage occurred of about EUR 2000, had to be disposed of.
Heil wants to examine other industries by fishing industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the fishing industry back to light.
Law enforcement is a short time ahead.
But are they right - and will it remain?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors in accordance with the current strict rules against fraud in the Fleischin industry.
"We are going to cover the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector, if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against the general restriction of contracts.
After the massive Corona explosion at the fishies of Törnées in Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Bundeskabinet wants to decide a law of Heil this Wednesday.
In the case of rape, rape and trafficking in human beings, there should be no more use of foreign personnel.
This should prohibit the use of contracts and leasers.
Mr Ingo Kramer said: "Finger is away from a general restriction of contracts and employment, if you do not want to give up the economy entirely."
Work contracts, for example, for large areas of handwork, construction industry and plant building, were the basis for their value creation in customers.
"The pledges of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial operation hires a manufacturer to build a security plant, it is a very normal contract."
The German meat industry is subject to a ban on works contracts and leases alone in its manufacturing industry.
If it is not clear why the distribution and packaging of cheeses should apply to other labour rights in the future than in Wurst, it is in an opinion on the draft legislation, as reported by the "New Osnabrück newspaper" (Samsday).
At a ban, then, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 per cent per kilo and product.
A number of Eastern European workers from business companies worked in the industry after the results of a review of the NRW Labour Protection Administration in 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Loan was kept for protection equipment or rental.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often misappropriate.
Heil said that the meat industry had already entered into force in 2017.
But they have been transformed through "tricky structures".
"Now you have to be thoroughly raised."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide at the end of July, it is also measures not only about the meat sector - for example, higher labour protection checks or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The current draft includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat sector and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) has more extensive controls necessary.
"I would like to be able to do more control in many surveillance areas: food control, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB's "Brandenburg Current".
However, more staffing is needed for more controls.
Three deaths at the end of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people died after the breakup of an ultralight aircraft at a multiple family home in Wesel in the German Federal Republic of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to the police.
A child would be easily injured.
Two more people have been saved in the disaster, said a speaker of the Circulatory Wessel.
In the accident, if there was a random screen, the police would have found it.
The "Rheinic Post" reported on eyebrows, and before the turn of the turn, the aircraft was assembled with a helicopter.
At home it is a single or double family home.
More details were not first known.
Room of Frankfurt Opernplatz peacefully run
One week after the expeditions in Frankfurt, the opera room was also peaceful on Sunday night.
Finally, a few thousand people stood on the spot, but left him about 1 hour before the start of the stop.
The police had been using a number of officers since the early evening, and the whole city area had a larger police service offer.
For the first time, this week from midnight, a ban was imposed on the operating site on which it came to steal a week ago.
The police had been attacked out of the crowd with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police entry, and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also a quiet one.
Car overload: Young woman in accidents at the Federal Street 83 in Hofgeismmar seriously injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old had suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 13.25 a.m.
She was taken to the Clinic Cassel.
With thermal cameras, the firewall was looking for possible drivers.
According to the police on the Federal Street 83 in the direction of her apartment, the woman was on her way to Hümme, when her car came out of an unexplained cause of the train and several times passed by.
To save the injuries, the fireman had to clear the roof of the Pkw.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the car, the adjacent Maisfeld from the trailer was searched with a heat camera.
The Drohnen staff from Warburg, also working with thermal cameras, was also ordered for the search.
However, the use forces did not find anyone among the high Maisp plants.
The severity of the injuries was brought with the rescue vessel into the Casteler Clinic.
Nearly 50 uses of the firefighter Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were in front of the site.
The federal street was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescue tower by Christian Ronaldo, the record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian mastership for the ninth time in series.
The man around the fifth world football team made the whole 36th scudetto of the history of the association with a 2:0 (1:0) on the Sunday floor in the home game against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 in the morning.
With 83 points, Turin, which, without the last-founded former national player Sami Khadira, is no longer able to spend two days before the season of the A series.
The table width of Inter-Miland is seven points back.
Juventus was an optical supposition in the first half of the year, and Ronaldo met for a free break with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic was evaluated by the 35-year-olds from the trauma border directly with a flag committee (45.+7).
To the present offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his shock Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
Thus, the unscathed, but decisive success was guaranteed.
The flooring of the floor in the 89 minutes may have been the only Ronaldo himself, looking at the Torrjäger value.
"It is complicated, mentally and physically to stay at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are rare, and the moment changes very easily," said Coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
In particular, the spiritual creation of his player is great, said the Juve-Coach.
Because of the low location, the tournaments had not been able to make the mastership perfect yet.
Finally, Juve had to consider, above all, the failure of the competitors.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri men were only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will be a king of torpedo, it is questionable.
Because during the Portuguese superstar reached up to 31 tower, the former Dortmunder Ciro real estate after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome's fourth table at Hellas Verona has already 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski claimed to be the title winner of the FC Bayern.
The current Juve Profi Gonzalo Higuín is the record in Italy.
The Argentinian achieved 36 towers for the SSC Neapel in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Dame" of the Italian football club awaits the next title chance.
Juventus is at the end of the League Championships, however, on August 7 against Olympic Lyon, a 0:1-Hinsplay to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be expected to be the enemy.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors found
Stuttgart - All of the victims of the threat of punishment and judicial proceedings are given by car drivers at unpaid illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets further gas: In the past year and in the first four months of this year, the police in the south-west have already registered more than 250 illegal authors.
There are no comparisons for the years before, but the Raser makes the judicial authorities increasingly work: In 2018 there were 155 investigation procedures for illegal rents, 252 of them were already in progress until the beginning of June 151.
In the course of the race, it was less about organised events, such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs's response to a request from the Landday SPD.
In most cases, the driver had acted against each other or had taken the flight before the police - it is also shown as an illegal race.
The tax consists mainly of German men aged between 18 and 60.
113 Penalty of money - 15 times debt
Only in relatively few cases will the racer be fired and also prayed for the case: According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, since 2018 the total of 113 fines have been committed and 15 sentences have been issued.
However, there is no point of reference that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Other car drivers responded more frequently because of various tragic accidents and processes in the past years more sensitive than before and often showed up, a ministerial speaker said.
In Rasern, the bus is especially popular. The 8th is always the busy car driver out there in order to get a place and use the free route for a race.
In last August, a dozen drivers were fired near Churchheim under the roof, and three months earlier, there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Mercling.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police register even more rent than on any other federal car.
With a Tempolimite, the racer is tried to break out on the section especially concerned between snakes and ghosts.
The most highly priced and popular sports and luxury rosaries often have Swiss brands because the drivers are slowing down due to the high penalties for fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country to race to Germany.
For the SPD, the Tempolimite cannot be reduced to a few tracks: "With a general temperature of 130 hours, we would create this problem on the road from the lion," says Martin River, the transport expert of the SPD-country group.
"The thresholds for racer would be significantly higher if you weren't here and there were still legally 200 kilometers and more on the way."
River says less of the advertising or image campaigns: "If anyone acts in such a way over all the rules and not only his own life, but also the life of other transport players is not yet available."
ADAC requires stronger police coverage
However, the ADAC is not able to say, "We are going to avoid being distracted by the race from the Tempolimits," says Holger Bach, Department of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and further checks on the tracks concerned.
Not rare is the result of the high-speed force measurement of pain and the following severe severity: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people die on the run, two of which are not involved in a night crash in Stuttgarts Innenstadt and one in Gerlingen.
There two young men were supposed to have delivered an autorenous race in November.
One of the vehicles came out of the street, fell down against a garden wall, and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old driver died.
21 other people were injured during the race of the past two years.
However, severe punishments are not necessary in the view of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The need for enforcement to punish illegal motor vehicles is not seen," says the Ministry of Internal Affairs paper.
Luggage of 23 July: Transient breakers Steady drinks from Imbis
Rohrdorf: On Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) a man broke into an Imbis and stole drinks and money.

The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1,75 to 1.80 meters large and of a strong structure.
In fact, he wore a black capuzen powder, black hoes and bright shoes.
Further evidence is against the police.
Ackermann sprints to win at the finish stop at Sibiu Tour
Radprofifi Pascal Ackermann fought his second day at the end of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old runners of the Bora-hansgrohe team sat on the 109-kilometre long section with start and target in Hermannstadt in the mass press after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was three and four seasons for Ackermann.
In total, Gregor Mühlberger, an Austrian team leader, took part.
The 26-year-olds had decided the mountain time for themselves on the morning of the day and thus took over the peaks in the classroom.
Only 104 drivers were at the end of the night.
Not less than 18 starters had fallen to the time limit for the victim in the mountain season.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The Sprint was really Hexic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters ahead of the goal he just took his sprint, "and it's also perfectly broken."
A Corona test was performed six days before the start of the run.
During the complete round, drivers and managers were separated into isolated hygiene bottles from the organization team and the media.
Visitors to start and target were not allowed.
Leader gave a signal for the layer's animation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday in Düsseldorf-Garath.

Nürnberg: Unauthorized tuning-treffen - Police engages in, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and more than 1,000 people participated in a "tuning clubs" on the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police set up their announcement to strengthen the control of such events.
To a large tening event, it arrived on Saturday (July 25, 2020) in Nürnberger South.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Branch, an increase in traffic revenues in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstadt Street was established by the Nürnberger Transport Police at 22.30 a.m.
However, the police suggested a number of vehicle controls.
Just a short time ago, the police had announced that they wanted to proceed against so-called auto-posters.
Illegal Tuning meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "Szene"
The officers counted well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
However, this would only be a small part of the "Autoposer" and tunings scene.
Apparently, the majority of the scene concerned went back to the police call.
With the vehicles and persons present at the site, be aware that it was too much of a fraud.
In addition, the excess proportion of the inhabitants was considered to be subject to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the content of the minimum level and the traceability of a mouth-nasen protection.
The control measures carried out before the site were completed at 1:00 p.m.
In total, the staff of 10 vehicles made such constructive changes as to allow the operating permit to be granted.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No autoruns
I don't know. I don't think I've given it to illegal authors.
"The Central Police Bureau will continue to keep the case in mind and will continue to take enhanced control measures, as well as in relation to the rise of schoulists," it said.
The Agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the company involved: "They have all the beautiful fields that we must not weaken," Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for this.
Even because the car is wider, the company should be careful not to make damages.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars unharmed."
Number of work agency: 900 misappropriation cases for short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is following its own statement about 900 misgivings on short-term unemployment.
"This is with more than 880,000 companies showing short-term work, very little," said Daniel Terzenbach, responsible for the operational business, director of the "Frankfurter General News".
If at the beginning of the Corona crisis a lot of companies have applied for short-term work, the BA must have responded quickly.
The test normally lasts up to three weeks.
"For so long we were not available in this hot phase.
So we're going to look at the conclusions.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We're not a ship there and have a long breath."
Comments on abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis tools to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is prepared for a possible insolvent valve in the brain.
"Will there be more insolvency than in the previous year?
The estimates are different, but we are fighting for the case and we are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing insolvency claims."
The numbers are still inextricably, said Terzenbach.

The event was solved by the police.
Austria: Massentets to Corona Abbrech in Tourist Location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona explosion in the popular Upper Austria tourist resort St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48 as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results remained at night.

North Korea, border city according to Corona
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own actions to reverse the Coronavirus.
Now the country's first reported a mistake.
Because of a first official Corona incident in the country, North Korea has completely set up a large city in front of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological countermeasures in the past six months, the state media reported that the worst virus could be included in the country.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency has been postponed.
The Communist leadership calls out the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the country of departure.
North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its reverse measures as "lighting success".
The data were collected abroad.
The disease symptoms were subsequently identified in a "surrection" report, which passed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person has moved to South Korea three years ago and is now back across the border.
For the cross-border crossing within the four kilometers and the largest part of the military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, according to reports of the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military included the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
It's like some people's research.
North Korea subsequently called on its own information on Saturday because of the suspicion that the police office of the Workers' Party had attempted to intervene under the chairmanship of Machthaber Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could solve a deadly and devastating catastrophe".
Kim has already arranged on Friday as a precautionary measure, "Kaesong to block completely and isolate each region and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had contacted her, had been put under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party should then investigate the "disappearance" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, stop severe punishment.
In Kaesong, there are estimated to be about 300,000 people.
Delay before the meeting: East and West are still ahead of a great summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the Greens will also vote on the construction plan for the Great Urban Development Eastern Project", says the press release on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 a.m. in the large hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
In particular, the assessment of the eastern city will be discussed until the end of the controversy.
Most of them are slow, and eventually in individual committees, even if they are available.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from the municipality and then from administration and community-independence project, was no longer prepared after almost ten years, critically criticised against Reinhard Small as "ex-parliamentary opposition", "speculating", "revealing" and "consciously false".
"All of you think it's better to know," said a boy who has been a member of the Council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Civil List.
In fact, he is in the light of the Treaties in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The rise is cheaper for the city, the technical Council, as opposed to the statement of the City Administration, after claims that the existence of the small is believed to be worth EUR 8.5 million.
The city will develop differently, as it is forecasted in the Rathaus and on the side of the sponsors from the economy.
The city was designed by its own power and not by an investor: It was his plan B. One day after the day after the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejected the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the Sanctions of the Technical Council, the opening of the castle, the renting of the ex-thele for administrative areas and a smaller urban design in the ideal case with local tenants.
Play environmental themes central role
In addition, environmental themes will play a central role.
In this way, the Community will, inter alia, vote on the learning plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzhem population from health injuries caused by road traffic, including a number of temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, political officials in the city are not guilty of this because they have only contributed to the massive increase in road traffic and thus the VCD.
The Council also agrees on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda for the accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Protection Pact, the renewal of parental contributions to urban childcare facilities, and the application for inclusion in the Smart City Forum.

Tim Roomman starts with a lot of regrets in the new season
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Roomman started on July 31, in his premier season at ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of the superport cars can take up the regular operation, the first tests will now take place.
In particular, for Zimmermann, his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 went to know him more closely.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first round on the lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiums in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different than the Porsche from the presage," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go different into the curves.
But it has really made a lot of fun."
Roomman also had fun with Stein Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports cars in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Netherlands was able to help his new teammates in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges to myself," says Roomman.
"Stein and I understand us very well, and we have also made tremendous progress from session to session at Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also challenge its first race.
From July 31st, 33 superport cars will be hit by the noise.
The roomman, one of the 15 serials, knows the route.
2015 he was the last guest in the motorcycle room.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the street a little bit," says Zeppelin, who started for the Friedrichshaffen community, Graf Zeppelin.
"The listening has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally in order to be fast."
As soon as the roomman is real, that's two weeks out.
"Of course, the teams are poking a little at the tests," he says.
"As a result, we are very happy and happy on the first weekend at Lausitzring."
The rent in Brandenburg will be the reception of a hard-pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races were held.
The moment is that no visitors will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at Nürburgring, ex-formel-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will be placed in the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantäne's decision was declared cold
According to press reports, the British Government, after two weeks of return from Spain, has informed the Minister of Transport of the country.
This evening, Grant Shapps is currently in Spain on the holiday, while his colleagues decided to take the action on Saturday.

Virologs are primarily responsible for the nightlife for the new expansion.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the United Kingdom.
The British Government is currently exempt from unnecessary travel to Spain, which is now excluded from the fact that there are Canadians and Balearicians especially loved in British holidays.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the newly diagnosed Coronavirus have been registered in Spain and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
München (dpa) - The start in the hot preparation phase for the League champions began for double-saving FC Bayern with a backlog.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has already had to overcome after the first team training, how he can build his success after the destruction of World Master Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Chief of the Middle Ages Joshua Kimmich, has shown the third most recent minutes of use, has suffered a band damage on the left foothills and has to be missing in decisive King-class holes.
In Munich Schmudelätter, the law enforcement attorney took off a training game and was driven by a golf card from the place.

The Bayerns want to leave the mission from training on Sunday, but don't stop.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wanted to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show its invisible title collectors in the next 28 days until the King's final game on 23 August.
"We have just learned the duties with mastership and Pokal.
Now it's worth creating the special one," Flick said.
Until the Münchner can be specifically included with the final tournament and before a training camp at Algarve, however, the eight final duty against the FC Chelsea is first imposed.
After 3:0 in the event before the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic Arena should not be like the lost "Final dahome" 2012 once again to the Bayern album.

After days of individual and small group training, the Londoners are now trained in human strengths, which are in contrast to the flick collection in playthmus.
The monks could then have a fourth final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semifinals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents.
One way to finale in Lisbon "is not so simple," stressed the chief coach who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Close in training from Tuesday.

Formula 1 requires a special rule to reach its world master
Since the required number of continents cannot be threatened, the FIA must improvise to grant the WM title.
All American racers were dismissed.
Calendars will always be more specific
The calendar for the current form-1 session is in progress.
To the 10 confirmed Grand Prix, three additional lines were added during the week.
In October, Nürburgring was to be visited in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão.
In the first November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought at the Italian tradition line in Imola on WM points.
This includes the running calendar 2020 after the current position of 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our 2020 plan," said Formula-1-Boss Chase Carey.
In general, in this extraordinary season 15-18 races are to be completed in the Royal Class of Motor Sports.
In conclusion, formula 1 wants to end its season in Asia.
The final calendar should be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
The media reports in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, which were already officially played in December, are still available in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires running on three continents
The rule of formula 1 requires the award of the world empire, but at least three continents are running.
Even if, as is now planned, only two continents are threatened, there should be a world master.
By means of a special rule, the FIA wants to issue the title under appeal to "external circumstances" due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cut short due to the imminent Corona crisis.
A return to the continent is not a subject this year.
In addition, formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Affirmative in Brazil on Critics
Due to the tense situation, the currents in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not be located.
"We are happy to be with them again in the next season," said Carey.
The statement of the American race was particularly critical in Brazil: "The statement did not surprise us, but the reasons cannot be accepted," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The rates of infection in the São Paulo area were significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams that do not want to travel to Brazil would not justify a statement.
The safety measures required are prepared.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was in the famous lateight show by Stephen Colbert per video shoot at a guest and was interviewed about what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
The air-conditioned Greta Thunberg was available for guests in a popular US-Latin show.
She spoke, inter alia, of her struggle against the powers of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, client Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she talks in a famous lateight show about her plans in the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Lateight Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
They not only talk about their fight against climate change but also their conflict with the world’s authorities.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to ease the focus from the climate crisis," she said.
"All of organised Hass campaigns to smoke, just because a group of children is on the street," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who in social media are or are even trying to get away with them, they find "stupid", as they show the responses "because they have no other answer to it."
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed on a famous scene, in which she, President Trump, had a bitter look back.
At the UN climate summit in 2019 in New York, for which the Atlantic Activism was published, she was given a stronger look at the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet since.
From the short clip, a GIF was created, thus an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for drums.
But what did the 17-year-olds at this time think about the US Presidents?
In answer to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she only answered briefly and wondered, "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation is required."
With the sharp response, the experienced satiriker Colbert had probably not calculated and was short-lived laughing from the picture.
With her "How did you go?"-Speaking about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac Founder Peter Green died
His life was like a road trip: After an exciting climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply up and then slowly up again.
Now the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
The founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
If he had died peacefully at the age of 73, family members shared an official opinion on the same day, another opinion would be announced for the next day.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton valued Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction from a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-standing band 1967 in London, until today his famous instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is like a trail.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a tremendous rise - the band celebrated its greatest success but then without him.
It should have been given under other terms because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for prosperous purposes.
He started to appear in large arms and with a big cruzifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green lost the 1970 band.
It followed a social step.
The bluesrock guitarist is under drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographies reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in the Psychiatry.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He should be on the road temporarily, working as a peacekeeper and spent a long time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London city of Bethnal Green.
He has been interested in US blue musicians, such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters in his youth.
By the age of 13, he learned the first guitar lessons.
At the age of 15, the teen began to play professional guitars and five years later the chance to be lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on the stage.
Shortly thereafter he was engaged as substitute for his Idol Eric Clapton in the blood breakers.
In the middle of the Blues Boom Green founded in summer 1967 Fleetwood Mac together with his Blue Breakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green protected the first number-1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the quick rise soon showed his shadow pages: Green did not strengthen the media room, his experiments with the drugs LSD were always more extreme.
The life between music and search he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in my life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1 hit".
By the end of the decade, Green came to an amazing record with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac therefore vanished without it in a new formation on a success path.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" was sold worldwide more than 40 million times.
Despite various small solo results, Green did not have a larger comeback until 1996 with a group of friendly musicians again.
The British Daily Telegraph then spoke from a returned Rockstar.
Free of drugs released Green with Peter Green Splinter Group some albums until the band was released in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blue legend - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decade.
